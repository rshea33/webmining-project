The Shawshank Redemption,"Over the course of several years, two convicts form a friendship, seeking consolation and, eventually, redemption through basic compassion.","I&apos;ve lost count of the number of times I have seen this movie, but it is more than 20. It has to be one of the best movies ever made. It made me take notice Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins like I had never noticed any actors before.

I have from a very young age been a huge fan of anything Stephen King writes and had already read the short story that this movie is based on years prior to seeing this movie.

Not everything Stephen King has written that gets turned into a movie comes out well, but this is as close to perfection as it gets and has everything you could ever want in a movie.

Something that is outstanding is the fact that it has no real action, no special effects and no gimmicks. 99% of the movie is just men in a prison uniforms talking. Yet it absolutely hooks you almost from the beginning and has you glued to the screen to the end.

For me what really makes this film one of the best is the message of eternal hope it conveys throughout. The never ever give up hope attitude of the main character so well conveyed by Tim Robbins. The ending is just spine tingling every time I see it, no matter how many times I have seen it.

Brilliant, brilliant movie and a must see for everyone.",10,['Drama'],"['prison', 'based on the works of stephen king', 'escape from prison', 'friendship between men', 'voice over narration']",1994-10-14,['Frank Darabont'],"['Tim Robbins', 'Morgan Freeman', 'Bob Gunton']","['Stephen King', 'Frank Darabont']"

12 Angry Men,The jury in a New York City murder trial is frustrated by a single member whose skeptical caution forces them to more carefully consider the evidence before jumping to a hasty verdict.,"&apos;12 Angry Men&apos; is an outstanding film. It is proof that, for a film to be great, it does not need extensive scenery, elaborate costumes or expensive special effects - just superlative acting.

The twelve angry men are the twelve jurors of a murder case. An eighteen-year-old boy from a slum background is accused of stabbing his father to death and faces the electric chair if convicted. Eleven of the men believe the boy to be guilty; only one (Henry Fonda) has doubts. Can he manage to convince the others?

The court case provides only a framework, however. The film&apos;s greatness lies in its bringing-together of twelve different men who have never met each other before and the interaction of their characters as each man brings his own background and life experiences into the case. Thus, we have the hesitant football coach (Martin Balsam), the shy, uncertain bank clerk (John Fiedler), the aggressive call company director (Lee J. Cobb), the authoritative broker (E.G. Marshall), the self-conscious slum dweller (Jack Klugman), the solid, dependable painter (Edward Binns), the selfish salesman (Jack Warden), the calm, collected architect (Fonda), the thoughtful, observant older man (Joseph Sweeney), the racially bigoted garage owner (Ed Begley), the East European watchmaker (George Voskovec) and the beefcake advertising agent (Robert Webber) who has plenty of chat and little else.

Almost the entire film takes place in just one room, the jury room, where the men have retired to consider their verdict. The viewer finds him or herself sweating it out with the jury as the heat rises, literally and metaphorically, among the men as they make their way towards their final verdict. Interestingly, the jurors (apart from two at the end) are never named. They do not need to be. Their characters speak for them.

Henry Fonda is eminently suitable and excellently believable as the dissenter who brings home the importance of a jury&apos;s duty to examine evidence thoroughly and without prejudice. Joseph Sweeney is delightful as Juror No. 9, the quiet but shrewd old man who misses nothing, whilst E.G. Marshall brings his usual firmness and authority to the role of Juror No. 4. All the actors shine but perhaps the best performance is that of Lee J. Cobb as Juror No. 3, the hard, stubborn, aggressive, vindictive avenger who is reduced to breaking down when forced to confront the failure of his relationship with his own son.

Several of the stars of &apos;12 Angry Men&apos; became household names. Henry Fonda continued his distinguished career until his death in 1982, as well as fathering Jane and Peter. Lee J. Cobb landed the major role of Judge Henry Garth in &apos;The Virginian&apos;. E.G. Marshall enjoyed a long, reputable career on film and t.v., including playing Joseph P. Kennedy in the &apos;Kennedy&apos; mini-series. Jack Klugman was &apos;Quincy&apos; whilst John Fiedler voiced Piglet in the &apos;Winnie The Pooh&apos; films and cartoons.

Of the twelve, only John Fiedler, Jack Klugman and Jack Warden* are still alive. Although around the eighty mark, they are all still acting. The film was still available on video last year and it is shown on t.v. fairly frequently. I cannot recommend it too highly!

Fight Club,An insomniac office worker and a devil-may-care soap maker form an underground fight club that evolves into much more.,"Superb, and truly one of the greatest movies of all time.

It starts with the screenplay. Adapted from, and very faithful to, an excellent book. The book by Chuck Palahniuk was perfect for a movie: vivid, powerful, challenging, original, unpredictable. Considering how perfectly formed the book already was, the screenplay would have been a doddle.

Some very interesting themes are explored - consumerism, class warfare, multiple-personality disorder, male bonding, terrorism and anarchy - without being judgemental. 

Direction is spot-on. Perfect cinematography, pacing and editing. The twists and nuances of the book are captured perfectly.

Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are perfectly cast as the two lead characters, and deliver in spades. Helena Bonham Carter is a strange selection to take on the role of Marla, as she tends to act in Shakespearean dramas and other period pieces. However, despite this, her performance is very convincing.

An absolute classic.",10,['Drama'],"['surprise ending', 'anti establishment', 'insomnia', 'multiple personality disorder', 'based on novel']",1999-10-15,['David Fincher'],"['Brad Pitt', 'Edward Norton', 'Meat Loaf']","['Chuck Palahniuk', 'Jim Uhls']"

The books and the movies alike grasp one&apos;s attention as if they were real. You, the reader or viewer, can sense the pain of the characters, their emotions. The trilogy is truly powerful on screen. The second movie, however, I believe has something the first and third are missing; it feels like a bridge connecting two great islands. There is something unique about it that cannot easily be described. Metaphorically, the first movie is, say, a soldier. The third movie is the path home from war. And the second movie is the act of coming home because it contains the obstacles that must be passed through before achieving the goal. Although not 100% loyal to the written trilogy, the movies are done in such a way that the mainstream audience and LOTR fans from before the movies came out can say they were enjoyable and well made.",10,"['Action', 'Adventure', 'Drama']","['middle earth', 'wizard', 'hobbit', 'orc', 'mission']",2002-12-18,['Peter Jackson'],"['Elijah Wood', 'Ian McKellen', 'Viggo Mortensen']","['J.R.R.

GoodFellas,"The story of Henry Hill and his life in the mob, covering his relationship with his wife Karen Hill and his mob partners Jimmy Conway and Tommy DeVito in the Italian-American crime syndicate.","Needs to be seen to be believed; in one word: perfection. Every frame, every voice-over, every song - it all comes together at the exact right moment to create the perfect film experience. This film makes you really understand and feel what makes the American mafia so compelling; in the eyes of a kid, who was unfortunate enough to grow up in a tough neighborhood, those gangsters are rock stars. Live fast, die young - but when you die, it ain&apos;t gonna be of a glamorous suicide or drug overdose - the ending will be brutal, ugly and sad. And it may very well be one of your best friends that will blow your brains out.

I&apos;ll never get tired of watching Goodfellas; the entertainment value of this film is just amazing. It doesn&apos;t happen very often that every person involved in the process of making a film is at the peak of his/her game. And rarely do art and entertainment come together the way they did here. Storytelling with impeccable pacing, this is what it&apos;s like when a master composer conducts his masterpiece. All hail the king; the most versatile and talented filmmaker of his generation: Martin Scorsese.

Cidade de Deus,"In the slums of Rio, two kids&apos; paths diverge as one struggles to become a photographer and the other a kingpin.","The film, directed by Fernando Meirelles, tells the story of life in the slums of Rio de Janeiro, in an area known as the Cidade De Deus, the City of God. The story is told from the narration of the young photographer, Rocket. The different scenarios of life that make up the wider-story are presented in Pulp Fiction style chapters, complete with on-screen titles for each different story component. The story covers all the facets of the life, charting the growth of several key members of the gangs from childhood through to young adulthood, with their transformation from young hoodlums to local drugs barons. The final parts of the story focus on the battle within the Cidade De Deus between two different groups, when business and personal matters lead to an unavoidable confrontation. And what a confrontation it is, although details will not be given away here. The result is a powerful telling of life based around real-life events.

Martin Scorsese seems to have a heavy influence on the direction of this picture, with many moments looking familiar to fans of the legendary American filmmaker. Close ups, sweeping scene shots, freeze-and-zoom shots, and a frenzied handheld approach are all trademarks that will be recognisably traceable to Scorsese, having been used throughout his career. Many shots remind the viewer of Scorsese&apos;s narrative dialogue-camera relationship in Goodfellas, in which the camera was used to brilliant effect to highlight the main points in the script. This technique is used heavily in the first twenty minutes of Cidade De Deus, with the freeze frame trick being used to introduce the story&apos;s main characters alongside the dialogue of narrator, Rocket.

Throughout the film one cannot help but watch a scene and think, &apos;I&apos;ve seen that in Raging Bull, Goodfellas, or Casino&apos;, and this may make some look less favourably on the film&apos;s direction. However, it is not fair to consider this &apos;a Brazilian Goodfellas&apos;, as one critic has observed. The story has parallels - the underlying ideas of gangsters, drugs and violence -, the direction is similar, and the story is told with narration, much like Ray Liotta&apos;s role in Scorsese&apos;s epic. But to regard this film in terms of what styles it repeats or nods it&apos;s hat to, is to be very ignorant. Fernando Meirelles, has done a wonderfully hypnotic job of blending the old styles, and bringing them up to date with flashy and sometimes dangerously kinetic direction and editing. Look only to the leaving-party scene in which strobe lighting is used to extraordinary effect, almost suffocating the story below a bombardment on the visual senses. Think of a crossover between the visual energy of the Matrix and the violence of the club scene in Bad Boys.

Cidade De Deus is much more than a directorial assault on the senses. As Raul Walsh said if you don&apos;t have a story you have nothing, and many flashy Hollywood films have fallen short in using &apos;ultra-modern&apos; direction to disguise the fact that no substantial story exists underneath. Cidade De Deus is most brilliant in that it combines directorial and editorial brilliance with a story that is almost second to none in recent times. Only the true greats manage to cater to these two needs of cinema, and this is one that does. The direction is amazing, but not to disguise the story flaws, and the story is brilliant, but does not overwhelm directorial originality. But simply, Cidade De Deus is a perfect film for avid fans of cinematography, and those just in search of two hours of a bloody good story.

I cannot decide yet if I would consider this better than Amores Perros, but it is certainly not inferior. The at-the-same-time stylish and brutal visuals of Amores Perros are replaced by a grittier, more hands on approach to the subject. Whilst in Amores Perros the characters took precedent, in Cidade De Deus the location is as big a character as those who live there. As a result we get a much greater feeling of the environment in which the characters exist, and so it is perhaps easier to empathise, and/or sympathise with them. As the official press synopsis says, Cidade De Deus is a character, but is a place not a person. Amores Perros triumphs in creating relationships between the audience and the characters, as it concentrates for a long time on relatively few people, each of whom we grow to know and ultimately care about, which is important for the emotional impact of the film. Cidade De Deus deals with dozens, even hundreds, of characters, and so it is only a minority that we become attached to. This means that while the film leaves a lasting impact we are not left with the same inquisitiveness about the future for the characters that we meet in Amores Perros. Both films leave open ends, but Cidade De Deus feels closed. Whether you consider this a good or bad thing is a matter for personal choice.

Cidade De Deus is essential viewing, and is cinema at its most brilliant. It will of course feel the wrath of critics who will dwell on the almost unimaginably high body count, but there are always those who will reject violence in the movies. In fact the violence in Cidade De Deus, even the apocalyptic ending, is not as raw and bloody as many will expect. Blood spilling is a rare sight, and the violence rests mostly, but not always, on choreography rather than in your face bloodshed. The result is violence, but it is often so artistic that it looks beautiful rather than deterring. Like Scorsese&apos;s Taxi Driver the violence is abhorrent, but admirable from a cinematic perspective.

In short, this is a superb achievement, and is easily one of the best films of the year, and of the decade so far. Like it&apos;s predecessors, this is the latest film to come out of South America that indicates the emergence of major new talent in filmmaking.

Back to the Future,"Marty McFly, a 17-year-old high school student, is accidentally sent 30 years into the past in a time-traveling DeLorean invented by his close friend, the maverick scientist Doc Brown.","Zemeckis&apos;s &apos;Back To The Future&apos; trilogy has been a childhood favourite for a long time. Having revisited it today, brought me to a nostalgic state. The 80&apos;s saw a lot of excellent original fun &apos;young&apos; films like &apos;Back To The Future&apos; (of course), &apos;Better Off Dead&apos;, &apos;Heathers&apos;, &apos;The Breakfast Club&apos; etc. What really made these films immensely enjoyable then, and classics today, is that they really reflected what it was like being a young person in the 80s. The movies themselves were well written, well executed, well acted and they cut straight to the point.

Back to &apos;Back To The Future&apos;. This one is sheer fun, even today. There&apos;s an incredible energy about it but it still manages to stay an &apos;innocent&apos; film. The music is very effective. It&apos;s slick and follows a steady pace. The special effects are decent. Though people might pick on the plausibility of the time travelling, I think this is really a very minor flaw because it is overall a well written movie and the point was to entertain. Yet, this is not to say that it&apos;s brainless entertainment. I think it cleverly brings forth some interesting themes and I liked how they funnily used some ideas of Oedipus Rex&apos;s story.

The acting is superb overall. Christopher Lloyd as the over-the-top mad scientist is a laugh riot. Michael J. Fox totally owns Marty McFly with his natural charisma, raw energy and brilliant dialogue delivery. Lea Thompson is cute and vivacious and Crispin Glover is good.

&apos;Back To The Future&apos; is one of the most enjoyable time-travelling classics. It&apos;s over 23 years old and it still hasn&apos;t gotten old. Sadly, they don&apos;t make it like this these days but then again we always can revisit them.

Brody puts in a marvelous and utterly touching performance. The story depicts the emotional and cultural breakdown of persecuted Jewish community as Nazi policy tightens around them.

Even 30 years later I still remember sitting in a dark theatre with my heart pumping and everyone, and I mean everyone, screaming their lungs out.

Gisaengchung,Greed and class discrimination threaten the newly formed symbiotic relationship between the wealthy Park family and the destitute Kim clan.,"As a film about a family imposing on another, and keeping dark secrets hidden beneath the surface, Parasite achieves what Jordan Peele set out to do with Us: tell a multi-layered story in a widely entertaining manner, but without sacrificing the believability of its central narrative.

That&apos;s not to say that Us is an ineffective film by any means, but when it comes to crafting weighty social commentaries under the guise of lighter fare, writer-director Bong Joon-ho is in a class of his own.

The film follows a lower-class South Korean family as they slowly integrate themselves in the lives of an upper-class family and their lavish household. As their entanglement is spun out of a web of deceit, the lowly family find themselves skating on thin ice when it comes to keeping up appearances.

It&apos;s a twisty satire on social-economic disparities in South Korean society that swings broadly in tone, and sometimes threatens to tip over the edge, but never feels less than meticulously calculated in its tonal shifts.

However, to reveal anything more about the story would be to take away from the overall experience, as each act is marked by a major plot twist or revelation that keeps the film one step ahead of the viewer at all times.

natalie portman&apos;s performance was terrific as the emotionally ravaged matildha - best actress nomination for sure.

The Departed,An undercover cop and a mole in the police attempt to identify each other while infiltrating an Irish gang in South Boston.,"Definitely the the type of movie that makes it worth going to the theater. Very intense action and violence, twisting plot, lot&apos;s of misdirection.

The story line is a bit overly whelming at times, this isn&apos;t a good movie to watch if you&apos;re tired and follow the action, the double crosses and the sometimes confusing who&apos;s who of the movie, but if you can just remember the basic characters the minor twists won&apos;t be too confusing.

While it&apos;s certainly not a love story, there is that element, with a bit of a morality play going the whole time.

I can&apos;t make some of the statements I&apos;d like to make because I really try to avoid spoilers in my reviews, but I&apos;ll say that I enjoyed the movie even though had I been in charge it may have ended differently...

However, since it is not, Singer and MacQuarrie (who have joined forces again after the not-so-successful PUBLIC ACCESS) took advantage and duplicated nothing but the best. From CASABLANCA to PULP FICTION, and even a version of a line (intentionally or otherwise) from BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID.

Many people oppose watching a film with a twist a second time. I disagree. By watching it again you can observe how the director and the screenwriter have hidden and revealed clues, how they have tried to steer the audience away from the ending. First time is for entertainment. Second time is for art. This film is certainly worthwhile to see again. To date, I have watched it five times. (Two of those five times I thought, &apos;well, I&apos;ll just watch about half-an-hour,&apos; but ended up watching the entire film because it is so entertaining.) I&apos;m not exactly a noir fan, so it is assured that this particular crime film appeals to a wider audience.

Modern Times,The Tramp struggles to live in modern industrial society with the help of a young homeless woman.,"Part satire, part slapstick comedy, part melodrama; the great pioneer of film, Charles Chaplin, has created his own monument with this film. At the same time, &apos;Modern Times&apos; was Chaplin&apos;s last goodbye to the era of silent film - which, remarkably, had already ended almost a decade earlier.

After nearly 80 years, this screen marvel still makes me laugh, cry - and think about the ongoing automatization of practically every trivial little thing in our lives. Modern times, indeed. 

To me, this film is as entertaining and funny today as I imagine it was then, and it&apos;s certainly as relevant as it was then. 

The tramp still rules. My vote: 9 out of 10.

City Lights,"With the aid of a wealthy erratic tippler, a dewy-eyed tramp who has fallen in love with a sightless flower girl accumulates money to be able to help her medically.","This is my favorite Chaplin film, but I don&apos;t want that to diminish his other work, either. MODERN TIMES was an outstanding work of social satire, THE GOLD RUSH was great slapstick, and even the largely-neglected MONSIEUR VERDOUX strikes a certain unforgettable tone. Chaplin didn&apos;t make a bad movie, and I&apos;m not even sure that CL is his best, exactly. But it IS my favorite, if only for the ending.

That ending has been the subject of much comment here. I think it&apos;s a masterpiece in a single scene. Chaplin&apos;s little tramp has never seemed less like a character and more like a living, breathing human being. It&apos;s a monument to understated sentimentality.

To me, the rest of the film exists largely to set the context for that one magnificent piece of celluloid. Yes, the boxing scene is great, and the scene where he rescues the millionaire is also wonderful, but it&apos;s that ending that makes us all love this movie.",,"['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Romance']","['slapstick comedy', 'pantomime', 'music score composed by director', 'the little tramp character', 'car']",1931-03-07,['Charles Chaplin'],"['Charles Chaplin', 'Virginia Cherrill', 'Florence Lee']","['Charles Chaplin', 'Harry Carr', 'Harry Crocker']"

Memento,A man with short-term memory loss attempts to track down his wife&apos;s murderer.,"Thank Goodness I didn&apos;t read the reviews posted before I saw the film!! Most reviews (including ones on this site) will tell you waaayyyy too much about the movie, and that&apos;s just plain frustrating. But, as an avid cinephile, I promise not to do the same.

Memento is one of those pictures that will have you sitting in the theater after the lights come up so you can talk to everyone else about what they thought of the movie. This is a highly intelligent and original brain teaser that will have you guessing from beginning to end, and even afterwards. The story and the direction are the best I&apos;ve seen so far this year, and it deserves all the kudos it gets.

Plainly put, the film tells the story of Leonard Shelby: a man who lost his short term memory in an assault where his wife was raped and murdered; now he&apos;s looking for the killer, despite his handicap. Simple as that. You don&apos;t need to know anymore.

The film is constructed and told in such a way that you are constantly put into the shoes of Leonard Shelby, beautifully played by Guy Pierce. Carrie-Ann Moss gives an equally mysterious and complex performance. This film is well-made all the way around--from the direction, to the editing, and especially the unique story that is rarely found in Hollywood these days. Four Stars!

This review may have been a little dry on the details, but go see the movie--you&apos;ll be thanking me later.

PS: Only go to the official website AFTER you&apos;ve seen the movie. It too will give too much away. Afterwards, though, go and look at it--it&apos;s pretty impressive.",,"['Mystery', 'Thriller']","['memory', 'short term memory loss', 'hidden truth', 'murder', 'telephone']",2001-05-25,['Christopher Nolan'],"['Guy Pearce', 'Carrie-Anne Moss', 'Joe Pantoliano']","['Christopher Nolan', 'Jonathan Nolan']"
Django Unchained,"With the help of a German bounty-hunter, a freed slave sets out to rescue his wife from a brutal plantation owner in Mississippi.","I only had one thought on my mind for this Christmas: see Django Unchained. Quentin Tarantino&apos;s latest opus, a Western set two years before the Civil War, concerns a former slave named Django (Jamie Foxx). He is freed by bounty hunter Dr. King Shultz (Christoph Waltz) in order to help him with a bounty. Quite quickly, Shultz takes Django under his wing and trains him as his partner. But he made him a promise: that he would rescue his wife from a plantation owned by the ruthless Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). And rescuing her is not going to be all that easy.

What pains me the most about Django Unchained, as a die-hard Tarantino fan, is just how sloppy it all seems. I enjoyed every minute of it, but I could never shake the feeling of how messy and thrown together it all feels. Portions of the film feel episodic (the search for the Brittle Brothers, mentioned heavily in the trailers, begins and ends practically within minutes), and some scenes just seem to play out just for the fun of it. Another scene from the trailers involving a lynch mob with bags covering their faces seems added for comedic purposes, and has no real point of actually existing. More than any of his films before it, Django feels like Tarantino simply making a movie for sheer pleasure and with no outside motivations or controllers. 

The film threatens to go totally off the rails at any given moment, and lacks any real sense of direction or focus. It may sound ridiculous, but the loss of editor Sally Menke confirms a sneaking suspicion I always had about Tarantino – he needed a steady right hand to help encourage him as to what was needed and what was not. I do not want to criticize Django&apos;s editor Fred Raskin, but it is obvious he is no Menke and that works against the film heavily. It lacks the polish we have come to expect, and is practically stripped of the glossy/cool texture so prevalent in Tarantino&apos;s work up until now.

But then maybe that was his intention all along, and perhaps Tarantino is airing out his frustrations with life and film in general. Django is deliberately shot on film (or at least from the print I saw), and looks very gritty and messy at all times. It is significantly more brutally violent than anything he has worked on before (the borderline cartoonish Kill Bill included), and has a very go for broke attitude about itself. The film seems to revel in how brilliantly it can splatter all the blood and gore (done through the use of squibs and no digital!), and how uncomfortably numbing it can make the violence. I know he does not care what people think of his films, but this movie especially seems like an emphatically raised middle finger to the establishment. And for all of my complaints about how messy it all feels, I was never once bored or felt like the movie was dragging itself out. The staggering 165-minute running time shockingly flies by faster than you might ever imagine.

Acting wise, Tarantino stacks the deck with a number of recognizable character actors young and old for roles that vary in size. Most have very few lines, if any at all, and seem to just stand by, just as content as the audience is to watch the action unfold. It is a little off-putting, especially with how important some of these characters are initially made out to be. Washington as Broomhilda von Shaft (one of the most subtle references he&apos;s ever dropped) does well as the helpless victim and frequent dreamlike object – but she never really gets to show off any of her acting prowess outside of her facial reactions. They are increasingly effective, especially during horrific flashback scenes. But her work here feels ridiculously stunted in comparison to the other leads. Samuel L. Jackson, much like Tarantino himself, seems to just be having fun in his role as Candie&apos;s adviser Stephen. He plays on every ridiculous stereotype he ever has been associated with and then amps it up to a near ludicrous state. He is frequently hilarious, but the role seems to border on parody more than anything else.

Surprisingly, Foxx takes a very long time settling into the leading role. It may just be the character, but it is quite clear from the on- set that he is not very comfortable in Django&apos;s shoes, and leads credence to why Will Smith, amongst so many others, dropped out of the picture so quickly. But once he finds his footing, he does a fantastic job walking the thin line between empathetic and sadistic. It is not an easy character to play, but Foxx makes it his own, bringing a sense of style and grace that are virtually absent from the rest of the film. And of course, he gets all the best lines.

Waltz and DiCaprio are the clear standouts however, nailing every nuance of their sadly underwritten characters. While Waltz plays the straight man, DiCaprio is delightfully unhinged and vicious. Both are playing directly against type, yet are strangely comfortable in the roles. Watching them act circles around the rest of the cast, Foxx included, is the true highlight of the film. I just wish they were both given additional emphasis and more to do. 

For all of its numerous faults, I had a blast watching Django Unchained. It is hilarious, it is a lot of fun, and is wildly enjoyable. I genuinely think it could have been a lot better if there was more focus and direction, but this is very clearly a picture Tarantino wanted to make on his own terms. And for that, I applaud him for the effort. It is not his best work, but certainly not his worst.

Raiders of the Lost Ark,"In 1936, archaeologist and adventurer Indiana Jones is hired by the U.S. government to find the Ark of the Covenant before the Nazis can obtain its awesome powers.","I&apos;ve seen Raiders of the Lost Ark numerous times on TV, DVD and big screen. My local theatre had a special showing last night and the 400-seat screen completely sold out (as Indy films always do). Luckily for me and my pal, we got the last 2 tickets available! I can&apos;t think of many films that still sell-out 25 years after their original release. There&apos;s just something about Indy movies(iconic hero, affection, epic spectacle) that brings you back again and again.

The only trouble with that is there are zillions of reviews, critiques and dissections of this movie already out there, so what I have to offer will probably not be anything new. I will however not go the way of the cliché and mention 1930&apos;s serials, Tom Selleck or the sword/gun fight.

I will, however, ask you one question. Did you know that some of the more iconic, memorable sequences from Raiders owe quite a lot to Duck Tales? What? Surely it&apos;s the other way around? Well, no. The globe-trotting adventures of Scrooge McDuck, Huey, Duey, Luey and Donald in Carl Bank&apos;s Disney comic-books from the 50s came first. If you can find some of these then you&apos;ll surely notice the similarities.

The hunt for the Ark of the Covenant is more than just an excuse for action. So many movies these days seem to come up with action first and string them together with some lame plot. Movies like this are quickly forgotten and one of the reasons Raiders holds up so well is because it works the Covenant story so well into the plot.

The action comes in a succession of set-pieces. I do enjoy films that have to increasingly better themselves in every scene. Raiders introduced this as a standard that the sequels had to live up to. My fave scene has to be the massive truck chase through Egypt, which is made up of many of its own smaller sequences. One little idiosyncrasy I like about Indy is that even though he&apos;s a College Professor and Doctor, he has no beef killing people. So very far from the ubiquitous PC heroes of todays movies.

You might think that it&apos;s rather geeky to hype up the editing and sound design, but they do stand out from recent action movies. The gunfire and punching seem to have a sort of &apos;Indy&apos; signature sound to them, that I&apos;ve not heard in any other films. And obviously, John William&apos;s classic score is one of those themes that just everybody in the world knows (though I prefer his score to Temple of Doom), truly one of the best movie themes ever. Better than Star Wars! 

I&apos;m not sure if Spielberg planned on Raiders starting the Indy franchise but there&apos;s already enough in here to establish a whole universe of potential stories and character arcs. There&apos;s talk of a fourth movie at the moment, but I personally don&apos;t think it will happen and I don&apos;t want it to. It&apos;s perfect existing as a trilogy and a sequel that comes traipsing in 18 years after the last is just not going to feel right. Even if you are hungry for more Indy then there are loads of books and video games out there and then there&apos;s the Young Indiana Jones TV show (where are the DVDs?), which are official Indy canon and even starred Ford once (they bounced around in time).

I am giving Raiders 9/10 because I just have a soft spot for Temple of Doom (which is obviously a 10/10 movie). Even 25 years after it first came out it still has the power to captivate the audience and provoke sheer excitement every time. And in 25 years it will still be far superior to almost everything.

Now there&apos;s something you cannot say about The Fast and the Furious!

This will end up being the animated film of the year and I had the same &apos;wow&apos; feeling as after seeing Ratatouille. Considering that animated films have always played second-fiddle to live-action, and have been aimed at kids, it&apos;s ironic that once again Pixar produces a film that rivals any live action on every level.

It is visually engaging and beautiful in every scene, not to mention with an incredibly unique art style, and is honestly something other animated movies should have to look up to for a long time.

I went in to the theater not knowing what to expect, but was pretty sure it would be worth the ticket price. Boy was I happy when I left. Not only was it worth the ticket, I paid to see this film two more times. This film is virtually perfect. The acting is superb, the story is magnificent, the narrative is brilliant, and the structure of the film is truly groundbreaking (absolutely loved the last 20 minutes). What really surprised me about this film was how well the cinematography was done. In a small, character driven film such as this, it is very unusual to have such great cinematography. With this film, there is something interesting going on in every scene, not many films you can say that about. In a year where first time directors have made some of the best films, Three Kings, Being John Malkovich, etc... Sam Mendes seems to have out-done them all.

People will complain, will argue that I am wrong, but I will say it again...Braveheart is as close to perfection as a movie can be. The acting is superb, the man who played Lonshanks, the actor who portrayed Robert the Bruce, both should have been nominated for Oscars due to their powerful rendering of evil and a man who is saved from losing his humanity (from becoming evil) by meeting William Wallace. And let us not forget the direction, the cinematography. Braveheart is glorious, beautiful to look at. The slow motion pictures of horses preparing to charge armed combatants, the entire landscape of Scotland that Mel Gibson captures with the camera. Braveheart is artwork, it is as good as any picture. That the film is number 93 on the list of the top 250 movies ever is a shame. Yes there is violence in this film but that violence does serve a point...that freedom isn&apos;t free and sometimes it takes death, gruesome and horrible, to let ones people taste what it is like to be free.

I had read quite a bit about this film and its director but was still totally overwhelmed by the beauty and brutality of this movie. The complexity of this movie is something never seen in the United States in an animated movie and even exceeds that of most live action movies as well. It combines love and hate, war and romance, nobility and deception in ways rarely seen in movies today. Lines of good and evil are anything but clear cut and in the end is hope but no guarantees, no promises.

Once Upon a Time in America,"A former Prohibition-era Jewish gangster returns to the Lower East Side of Manhattan 35 years later, where he must once again confront the ghosts and regrets of his old life.","My title sums up the film, albeit cliche, the film is a masterpiece. The story of a gang&apos;s rise from the prohibition years to the 60s. The film&apos;s main 2 character&apos;s are the focus of the picture. Without trying to spoil it, the film addresses 3 distinct eras in their lives.

The film explores the heart, Noodles soul. A man struggling with himself, someone who plays evil acts, a man who sees the pure in his childhood sweetheart. A man never at peace.

The film is directed by Leone, a master of his art. I&apos;m a huge fan of his work. Each of his films got better and better, and Once Upon A time In America was a picture which had all the experience which he achieved in the 60s. It&apos;s almost a gift to himself.

The film&apos;s locations are stunning, authentic and dirty.

The screenplay is excellent, but the direction makes the film. Maybe one or two characters were underwritten, but it seems that the director wanted us to talk about the picture, discuss the possible loose ends, make up our own minds. Leone&apos;s methodical pacing is stunning.

The acting is tremendous, can&apos;t praise James Woods and Robert De Niro enough, awesome!

The photography is beautiful, it lacks colour giving it a gritty look, perfection!

Morricone delivers another masterpiece, his score adds further depth and backups the director&apos;s story.

Good Will Hunting,"Will Hunting, a janitor at M.I.T., has a gift for mathematics, but needs help from a psychologist to find direction in his life.","A lot of things have been said about this fantastic movie, and I only hope to add a few more praises.

The fact that it was written by Ben and Matt was a shock to me, I did not expect any strong writing and a solid script, but boy was I wrong. The movie lasts for 2 hours, and every minute of it I couldn&apos;t even focus on anything beside the incredible world of Will Hunting.

Matt plays Will Hunting, who is a brilliant young man who denies his unreal intellect. Will has had a very abusive childhood which hurt him mentally to a point where he can no longer let anyone close to him aside from his best friend who is played by Ben. That is until a professor at one of the top colleges finds Will&apos;s talent and helps him out of trouble with the law. Robin Williams later comes in as a therapist to Will, he is the only one who can really stand up to Will&apos;s intellect and manages to break the layer of distrust that Will has developed over years of solitude, and the two develop a bond beyond friendship.

Yes there is a girl, but this is not a romantic movie. There is more to life then what we are taught and what we have to show for it.

The writing is witty, brilliant and hilarious at times, both Matt and Robin Williams preform wonderfully from both a comedic and theatrical prospective. Matt&apos;s best work since Dogma and Williams best along side Dead Poet&apos;s Society.

If your looking for a typical Hollywood movie with a Hollywood ending, then do not bother spending two hours on this movie. This movie is ahead of it&apos;s time, and lands an easy 10 out of 10.

I entered the theatre; the lights went out, the movie began, and after the first twenty seconds I was a child again. The laughter came often and natural. The story was even better then the previous two combined.

I went to go see this with my seven year old nephew and if I laughed that much when I was his age I know I had a good childhood. The mix of humour and emotion mad this movie one of the best I have ever seen, including big ones like Godfather and Shawshank.

This movie is both hard and easy to review because you try to look at the down sides to the movie but the hard part is that there isn&apos;t any. I&apos;m sure if you shut off your emotions you could see a fault of two but when it comes to an animated trilogy this is by far the most enjoyable time you can spend in a theatre...

One, is that it is the greatest science-fiction epic ever made. This is supported by those who claim to understand the complexities involved and leading up the Star Child ending. The others, like myself, find it as absorbing as watching paint dry on woodwork.

The musical background is glorious, the colors are dazzling, and there&apos;s an interesting use of HAL as a villainous computer. Beyond that, there is nothing the least bit interesting about the human characters (trite dialogue and no personality or warmth to any of the individuals), the pace is unbelievably slow (so the intellectually gifted can philosophize on the mysteries of space), and the payoff at the end leaves you either breathless with enlightenment or convinced that you have watched three hours of nothingness.

I had the same letdown feeling when I watched THE CLOCKWORK ORANGE, so your like or dislike of this movie is purely dependent on personal taste.

No special effects of note, no big budget, no set-pieces of note, no heroes, no redemption. I feel quite sure the director has really captured what war &apos;feels&apos; like - unlike Spielberg and Coppola&apos;s depictions of war, this director lived through WW2 and the horrific siege of Stalingrad, as well as spending many months researching the massacres in Belarus, one of which he depicts in this film (this from the DVD extras, well worth watching).

Lawrence of Arabia,"The story of T.E. Lawrence, the English officer who successfully united and led the diverse, often warring, Arab tribes during World War I in order to fight the Turks.","I first saw this film on its release, aged 13, and it forms an important part of my transition towards adulthood. I am pleased to see that it consistently rates 20something in the IMDb listings, even from others (whom I envy, for I can&apos;t see it with fresh eyes) who are seeing it for the first time. Pleasing too is that some of those are also teenagers, for whom a forty-three year old film must itself seem part of the past. As for the minority who are bored by intentionally slow pacing (and for whom punctuation, paragraphing and grammar are a lost art), I suggest they learn a little about the history of film-making (from which it may become apparent that much of today&apos;s fast editing techniques were invented in the 1920s: try Eisenstein&apos;s October, for example).

From the universally admired cinematography of Freddie Young, the long shot of Omar Sharif&apos;s floating mirage entry, the pre-CGI battles and pan-up scene changes, to O&apos;Toole&apos;s florid but career-defining performance and the (then) novel time-shift narrative, this film set standards not matched even by Lean himself, and, as many reviewers have commented, financially and practically unlikely to be attempted today. I too have rarely seen such clarity of image outside of Imax, and in my view the script by Robert Bolt (and I now have learnt, an uncredited Michael Wilson) is the finest in cinema. Maurice Jarre&apos;s music and some of the acting style now seem a little excessive, but repeated viewing (around 35 times in my case) does not diminish the impact and quality, and the restoration and now DVD release still, after all these years, approaches the effect of that first 1962 viewing.

It is rare that repeated watching of a film (as opposed to a live performance) does this, and the reasons go beyond the photography, performances and editing. In my opinion, it is because the characterisation and storytelling encourage an appreciation of the ambiguity and inconsistency behind our motives and behaviour, and, in a wartime scenario, in the contrast between political expedience and personal morality. For a 13-year old, this opened a window into the adult world, and it explains why the story has resonance far beyond its setting. The film doesn&apos;t require an understanding of middle-east politics (though it does have some very current relevance), but it does require an ability to look, listen and understand. The fact that so many people rate it so highly says everything about its wider impact. When The Matrix and even Lord of the Rings have slipped out of the ratings (and the adolescents who inhabit these pages have grown up), I believe this film will still be in the 20s or 30s, perhaps enabling young people to once again see the world through adult eyes.

Like Ali, I fear Lawrence. I fear the power of art to change us, to challenge our preconceptions. Every time I see this film I learn a little more, discover something new. When I was 13 I didn&apos;t understand much, but this film helped me to see that I wanted more, knew more, than my peers. I can&apos;t rate it more highly than that.",10,"['Adventure', 'Biography', 'Drama']","['desert', 'arabia', 'ottoman empire', 'arab', 'bedouin']",1962-12-11,['David Lean'],"['Peter O&apos;Toole', 'Alec Guinness', 'Anthony Quinn']","['Robert Bolt', 'Michael Wilson']"
Ikiru,A bureaucrat tries to find meaning in his life after he discovers he has terminal cancer.,"Kanji Watanabi is a quiet, melancholy man who has spent all his life behind his office desk doing sweet eff-all. When he is diagnosed with stomach cancer he realizes that he has been petty much dead his whole life, and searches desperately for away to live again.

This is Akira Kurosawa&apos;s masterpiece, yes, even better than Rashomon and The Seven Samauri. It is a perfect true story of everybody&apos;s life- how we don&apos;t even realize we have it until we know it will be over in a short while. Watanabi&apos;s quest for self-discovery is one of the greatest from any motion picture ever made. The all-too-true paradox is one to end all paradoxes- that Watanabi is dead, and had been all his life, until he realized he was sick, which is when he began living for the first time. Takashi Shimura, the actor best known for his role as the wise, bald-headed Samauri in The Seven Samauri, and the professor out of the early Godzilla films, plays Watanabi perfectly- in my mind, it&apos;s one of the greatest film performances of all time.

Vertigo,"A former San Francisco police detective juggles wrestling with his personal demons and becoming obsessed with the hauntingly beautiful woman he has been hired to trail, who may be deeply disturbed.","An interesting psychological piece that richly displays Hitchcock&apos;s talents. It is unfair to compare this film to the suspense thrillers of today which are subjected to more realism in sex and violence. Hitchcock had to be more subtle in 1958, where I&apos;m sure a work like this, that seems tame by today&apos;s standards, appeared bizarre and risqué. Also the acting here seems histrionic; not that people actually spoke like that in the 50s but the audiences liked such dictionally refined dialogue back then as opposed to the lines of modern-day scripts that more accurately portray the way individuals speak.

 	James Stewart and Kim Novak are appealing on numerous levels, the former mainly because he doesn&apos;t wander far from the amiable joe we have come to expect (even though he does weird-out near the conclusion) and the latter because she maintains a veneer of vulnerability that we can relate to.

 	This is not a film I especially like (I couldn&apos;t watch it again and again) but I respect for its strong filmmaking.",,"['Mystery', 'Romance', 'Thriller']","['romantic obsession', 'san francisco bay', 'vertigo', '1950s', 'acrophobia']",1958-05-22,['Alfred Hitchcock'],"['James Stewart', 'Kim Novak', 'Barbara Bel Geddes']","['Alec Coppel', 'Samuel A.

Le fabuleux destin d&apos;Amélie Poulain,"Amélie is an innocent and naive girl in Paris with her own sense of justice. She decides to help those around her and, along the way, discovers love.","&apos;Le Fabuleux Destin d&apos;Amélie Poulain&apos; finds its charm in the little things. The story about Amélie (Audrey Tautou) is a modern day fairy tale and that is exactly how it looks the entire film. 

We have a wonderful story about Amélie who decides to help people around her, making them happy. Not by doing great big things or giving money, but by little things. She helps her father by making him believe that his gnome from the garden is on a trip around the world, she helps a lonely neighbor by just visiting him, she helps a stranger by returning something she found in her home. On the way she falls in love with Nino (Mathieu Kassovitz) who&apos;s hobby it is to collect photos from automatic photo booths. Photos that were tossed away because people thought they didn&apos;t look good enough. He puts all those photos and pieces of photos in a big book. There is a little mystery in the book as well, of course I will not spoil that for you. The story is not only sweet and charming, it has some great moments of comedy as well.

The movie looks colorful and bright almost constantly. Even the sad parts from Amélie&apos;s life, her youth for example, look almost strangely happy. In this world, Paris actually, Audrey Tautou is the perfect inhabitant. She has one of those faces that seem to smile the entire time. She looks like she just pulled a joke and she is waiting for you to find out what it is. In a way her character is really doing that here so it does not feel strange.

In short &apos;Le Fabuleux Destin d&apos;Amélie Poulain&apos; is charming, funny, romantic bright and full of life. This is the perfect lighthearted movie.",9,"['Comedy', 'Romance']","['female protagonist', 'voice over narration', 'france', 'following someone', 'paris france']",2002-02-08,['Jean-Pierre Jeunet'],"['Audrey Tautou', 'Mathieu Kassovitz', 'Rufus']","['Guillaume Laurant', 'Jean-Pierre Jeunet']"

Double Indemnity,"A Los Angeles insurance representative lets an alluring housewife seduce him into a scheme of insurance fraud and murder that arouses the suspicion of his colleague, an insurance investigator.","Vintage Noir Film with gritty interpretation , atmospheric settings , crackling dialogue throughout and powerhouse filmmaking . This Billy Wilder&apos;s first thriller is one of the finest Noir film ever made . A scheming wife (Barbara Stanwyck) lures an insurance salesman (Fred MacMurray , though Alan Ladd, George Raft, Brian Donlevy, James Cagney, Spencer Tracy, Gregory Peck, and Fredric March were all up for the leading role) into helping murder her husband and then declare it an accident . Both of whom concoct a twisted scheme to collect the benefits of a insurance policy . As the hubby&apos;s policy contains a clause that states that if the husband&apos;s death caused by a moving train the policy pays double face value . The investigator&apos;s boss (Edward G. Robinson) , not knowing his colleague is involved in it , suspects murder and sets out to prove it .

This first-rate and entertaining American classic Noir film draws its riveting tale and power from the interaction of finely drawn roles as well as drama , emotion and moody atmosphere . This classic mystery thriller follows James M Cain&apos;s book fairly closely otherwise . Twisted film Noir about murder , troubled relationships , treason , dark secrets , including an unforgettable dialog ; being based on the James M Cain&apos;s novel , which in turn was based on the true story of Ruth Snyder, the subject of a notorious 1920s murder trial , being screen-written by the prestigious Raymond Chandler and the same Billy Wilder . However , Billy Wilder and Raymond Chandler did not get along well while writing this film&apos;s script, a process that was apparently filled with arguments . As Billy Wilder didn&apos;t really get on with the famous novelist whose constant drinking irritated the director . It packs a good realization , an original script , haunting atmosphere , intriguing events ; for that reason madness and murder prevail . Fred MacMurray is superb as insurance salesman coerced into murder plot and Barbara Stanwick as predatory and alluring Femme Fatale is magnificent . Here his colleague Edward G Robinson is extraordinary and as cool as ever ; he plays as the astute and stubborn investigator , his scenes with Fred MacMurray are awesome and at their best . But Edward G. Robinson&apos;s initial reluctance to sign on largely stemmed from the fact he wasn&apos;t keen on being demoted to third lead . Good support cast formed by notorious secondaries such as Porter Hall , Tom Powers , Jean Heather , Byron Barr and Fortunio Bonanova . And Raymond Chandler&apos;s cameo , this marks the only film appearance of screenwriter and novelist Raymond Chandler .

Exciting as well as complex film , possessing a mysterious and fascinating blend of gripping thriller , serenity , baroque suspense in which especially stands out the portentous performances , evocative cinematography in black and white by John F. Seitz and thrilling musical score by the classic Miklos Rozsa . The motion picture was stunningly directed by the great Billy Wilder , as the American Film Institute ranked this as the #29 Greatest Movie of All Time . The film was nominated for 7 Academy Awards but lost out on the night to Going my way (1944) by Leo McCarey. It got a deep inspiration for other films , it is particularly obvious for ¨Body heat¨ by Lawrence Kasdan with William Hurt , Kathleen Turner and Richard Crenna . Remade for TV in 1954 by Buzz Kulik with Frank Lovejoy , Ray Collins and Laraine Day , and 1973 TV remake of the 1940s classic by Jack Smight with Richard Crenna , Samantha Eggar , and Robert Webber .",8,"['Crime', 'Drama', 'Film-Noir']","['insurance investigation', 'femme fatale', 'insurance', 'insurance policy', 'insurance salesman']",1944-07-06,['Billy Wilder'],"['Fred MacMurray', 'Barbara Stanwyck', 'Edward G.

Incendies,Twins journey to the Middle East to discover their family history and fulfill their mother&apos;s last wishes.,"Want to see where one of the modern era&apos;s hottest directing streaks started? If you do, then Incendies in the film for you.

Directed by Denis Villeneuve, who went from this French/Canadian co-production to move onto Prisoners, Enemy, Sicario, Arrival and last year&apos;s brilliant sequel Blade Runner 2049, Incendies is the Oscar nominated film that put Villeneuve on the path he finds himself on now and remains a film of substantial power these years on from initial release.

Adapted from Wajdi Mouawad&apos;s play of the same name, Incendies is a multi-layered narrative that spans both numerous countries and numerous characters over various timelines but Villeneuve controls his film perfectly as the mystery that lays at the heart of this tale about family, war, life and death never gets muddled as we&apos;re drawn further and further into a film that wraps us up in its web and refuses to let us go.

There&apos;s not the abundance of filmmaking and visual flair that Villeneuve has started to become known for over his more recent Hollywood productions but Incendies power comes almost exclusively from Villeneuve&apos;s deft hand with his performers, his handling of a script that other filmmakers would struggle to bring to life and his ability to slowly ebb out more information as we go, that by the time we come to realise just what lays in store for the films characters, the power of Incendies becomes even more apparent.

Saying to much about this story would be a disservice to a film that takes many various turns and pivots. Essentially at its core, a story of both twins Jeanne and Simon Marwan trying to uncover the secret of their father they&apos;ve never met and find a brother they never knew they had after their Middle Eastern born mother Nawal passes away, Incendies becomes so much more than a typical family drama as it showcases time in the conflict of the Israeli and Palestinian Holy Wars, as well as the twins journey back to their country of nationality.

The film in many ways showcases a different side to Villeneuve and proves the director is just as at home handling a $150 million plus Sci-Fi for a major Hollywood studio as he is behind the camera of a small intimate drama that is driven purely by its narrative and characters. Proof the filmmaker is a man of many talents and a director to be cherished by those that love cinema.

Final Say - 

For any fans of Villeneuve&apos;s work, world cinema or powerful character driven dramas, then Incendies should be a film you seek out as soon as possible. Losing none of its power since its initial release, this sometimes hard to watch but always enthralling film is standout filmmaking and the official blasting off point for one of the modern era&apos;s great filmmakers.

Heat,A group of high-end professional thieves start to feel the heat from the LAPD when they unknowingly leave a clue at their latest heist.,"Sound like a bold statement? Devotees of classic cops and robbers flicks of old will no doubt take exception, but I believe that Michael Mann achieved some measure of perfection with Heat. To break this three-hour gem of a film down to its core, this is a film about men - strong men - and the supporting role that he women of the film have on them for better or worse. Take Pacino as good cop Vincent Hanna: one of the most intense characterizations of the tragic hero that I have ever witnessed, as he laments the demise of his third marriage to a pill-junkie wife. A fact which he discusses with his archnemesis (De Niro) in what history will regard as one of the most frenetic scenes in the history of film. The dialogue in this scene (at the very end of the first tape, if you own the VHS version) sets up the last half of the film beautifully, as our two rivals come to the joint realization that they have no hand in choosing the paths that will lead them to their ultimate confrontation: their very natures so define their respective actions that any attempt to do otherwise would simply be a waste of time. While I have heard others (who I am ashamed at times to call close friends) say that Heat drags in places, I will concede that there are moments in the film that require more than the cursory attention that they give to the movie they happen to be watching at any given time (I&apos;m sorry not every director is Jerry Bruckheimer), there are poignant developments of character in Heat that many would casually disregard. I am thinking of the interaction between the ex-con who finds conditional employment in a diner with an opportunistic scum of a boss, and whose girlfriend is so proud of him for swallowing his pride and not simply giving the sonofabitch a good pummeling. But there is a catharsis that I felt for that same ex-con when De Niro&apos;s character presents him with the opportunity to take just one more score, for old time&apos;s sake. Who doesn&apos;t feel for this guy - this minor character in a film with big-time heavyweights who gets to shine for a few brief moments. That&apos;s what Heat is really: a series of brief moments, some touching, others traumatic, and still others incredibly horrifying in the feelings that they inspire in the romantic who, like me sees not black or white portrayals of protagonist and villain, but a montage of grays that combine to create a vivid spectrum of film characterization that could not be found in hundreds of films combined. One of my five favorite films of all time, Heat is a cinematic banquet of intense imagery and pulse-pounding action.

To Kill a Mockingbird,"Atticus Finch, a widowed lawyer in Depression-era Alabama, defends a Black man against an undeserved rape charge, and tries to educate his young children against prejudice.","After hearing nothing but critical acclaim for this film, and the book it was based on, I finally got to see it. I am quite amazed at how well done this film is, and how timeless the theme is. I haven&apos;t read the book, but I&apos;m considering it, just to see if there are any details that were left out. The story is amazing and exceptionally told. As far as I know, the film is as close to the book as it could possibly be; some call it the most accurate book-to-film conversion ever. The plot is very good, it takes a timeless problem and presents it to us, through the innocent eyes of a naive child. The pace is very good; apart from The Godfather(the first one) and one or two other exceptions, this is the only drama where there was truly not one single moment that I found dull, boring or unimportant. Nothing seemed trivial in the film. The perspective that is forced upon us is that of a young child, naive and innocent. This is a brilliant idea, as the eyes of a child is without a doubt one of the most impressionable things in the world, and the film handles this perfectly. What really makes the film, apart from the brilliant and possibly unique perspective, is the fact that the children are likable, credible and charming. You couldn&apos;t help but like them; believe me, normally I really dislike children. I find them annoying, loud and egotistical. But with this film, I couldn&apos;t, for one second, muster up any tiny amount of aggression, or even annoyance. They come off as so likable, charming, and, most importantly, *real*. Almost every kid in any Hollywood movie is either a completely ridiculous stereotype/cliché of a brat, who does nothing but destroy things around him, or the exact opposite, a little angel. Everyone knows that no child is the latter all the time, and even I will admit that there probably doesn&apos;t exist too many children who are the first, either. In this film, the children are completely real. They are naive, innocent, they disobey what their father tells them, but ultimately, they obviously love and respect their father, and they never do anything, anything at all, with the intent to hurt or harm someone or something. That is what a child is; innocent. They do what they do because they do not know better. This film provides a perfect view into their world, or, rather, their perspective of it. The acting is excellent. The child actors exceed all expectations. I was amazed at how professional and convincing they were. The other actors all give great performances as well. The cinematography is excellent; once again, it gives a perfect perspective on what your surroundings look like when you&apos;re a child. The characters are well-written, credible and well-casted. The dialog was well-written. The script was excellent. A very memorable and beautiful film, should be viewed by almost anyone. I recommend this to anyone who likes dramas, and just about anyone who for one reason or another might enjoy this. Don&apos;t be scared off by it being over forty years old, or it being black and white; it&apos;s an excellent film, and just about anyone would enjoy it. Don&apos;t miss this perfect film. 10/10",10,"['Crime', 'Drama']","['trial', 'lawyer', 'small town', 'alabama', 'false accusation']",1963-03-16,['Robert Mulligan'],"['Gregory Peck', 'John Megna', 'Frank Overton']","['Harper Lee', 'Horton Foote']"
Up,"78-year-old Carl Fredricksen travels to Paradise Falls in his house equipped with balloons, inadvertently taking a young stowaway.","If there&apos;s a list of great computer animation movies of all time, Pixar would dominate most of the top positions. Great story, great voice talent, great timing, great for all ages. It&apos;d be hard to pick just one above another and perhaps another viewing of Up may be in order to figure out where I&apos;d place it among so much stellar work.

Up is by far the most emotional human drama of any Pixar movies thus far, very heavy, so much so if you&apos;re looking for pure fun with some jaw-dropping chase and/or thematic scenes and no downer moments, Up may not be for you. I saw it in a packed theatre of about a 65% adult, 35% adult split audience and it&apos;s the only time I can remember being in ANY animated movie where there was sniffles and watery eyes, and that was within the first 10 minutes of the movie. There&apos;s an undercurrent of life after losing a loved one in this movie, which I don&apos;t feel gives anything away. It&apos;s pretty heavy subject matter, Pixar handles it, like they do everything they touch, incredibly well, but it doesn&apos;t make it any less sad to have the material threaded throughout much of the movie you&apos;re reminded of it, but I suppose it&apos;s up to one&apos;s own interpretation of loss and how to place it in your life that perhaps will have an emotional effect on you.

Story is what makes a great movie great. Without story, you don&apos;t really have anything, maybe some effects, some action, maybe some cute or clever sight gags, maybe some laughs, hopefully some emotion, where Pixar shines above all others in animation and over a good 99% of the movies out there is they can intertwine it all and do it seemingly effortless, which is an incredible feat. To do this in a few movies is one thing, but Pixar has pretty much nailed this now for their entire career of making movies, that&apos;s just simply unprecedented. 

I should note I saw the 3D version which, to be honest, didn&apos;t really take the movie to the next level. One of the more well known syndicated reviewers had said you&apos;re better off seeing the non-3D version on screen, and I actually agree. The 3D glasses added little to nothing to the movie except for an eye-strain headache later in the night. It didn&apos;t take away from Up mind you, it just didn&apos;t add to it either. 

Up is a great movie either way you slice it and it should be noted, the theatre I saw it in gave it a fairly loud round of applause at the end. It&apos;s pretty rare these days that an audience applauds after a movie, perhaps we as a society has become too jaded, or too just expecting of the goods or feeling we&apos;re entitled to the entertainment. It&apos;s nice when a movie hits on all cylinders and elicits such a range and emotional reaction people who don&apos;t know each other in a packed room all gasp, laugh, cry, and applaud together. Great movies however can do that and Up is truly a great movie.",,"['Animation', 'Adventure', 'Comedy']","['heartfelt', 'balloon', 'talking dog', 'child in jeopardy', 'south america']",2009-05-29,"['Pete Docter', 'Bob Peterson']","['Edward Asner', 'Jordan Nagai', 'John Ratzenberger']","['Pete Docter', 'Bob Peterson', 'Tom McCarthy']"
The Sting,Two grifters team up to pull off the ultimate con.,"Small time conmen Johnny Hooker and Luther Coleman unwittingly scam a runner for Chicago main man Doyle Lonnegan. When Luther is murdered, Hooker goes on the run and seeks out Luther&apos;s old friend Henry Gondorff to help him put together a major sting to take revenge on Lonnegan. However with so much heat on Hooker and the stakes so high can they pull it off and get away clean?

Almost a follow up to Butch and Sundance, this film partners the stars of the day Newman and Redford to good effect. The story is a little less fun but still very enjoyable to watch as it builds to a great finale. The use of chapters ran the risk of fragmenting the film into bits but instead it really helps set it out and makes it more manageable. Although it is not as light hearted and jovial as the theme music suggests it still manages to flow nicely with the slightly darker drama not spoiling anything but only serving to make it feel more grown up.

The cast are all very good and make the film easy to watch. Redford comes off the best in terms of characters and his role really suits both his carefree attitude (the start of the film) but also his more serious side (the rest of the film). Newman has a lesser role that perhaps doesn&apos;t suit him quite as well, but he does have several really good scenes (the hustles) where he does very good work. Shaw&apos;s accent is a little heavy at first but I got used to it and it worked for me and he was a really good foil for Redford/Newman. The support cast including Durning, Walston, Gould, Jones and others all do good work.

The direction and use of music is really good and the sense of period is well crafted and doesn&apos;t just feel like it was painted on. I&apos;m not sure if it deserved Best Picture or not because I don&apos;t know what the rest of the field was for that year but it is a really enjoyable film that is quite fun to watch several times even 30 years later  and isn&apos;t that the main thing?",,"['Comedy', 'Crime', 'Drama']","['con man', 'illegal activity', 'playing golf', 'con artist', 'chase']",1973-12-25,['George Roy Hill'],"['Paul Newman', 'Robert Redford', 'Robert Shaw']",['David S.

It is so well-crafted; the twists of the plot throw up new moral dilemmas for all the protagonists, which are explored sensitively and without judgement - so refreshingly unlike mainstream American films. I felt sympathy for all the characters, even the threatening Hodjat, full of misplaced rage which often erupts volcanically. And as a footnote, the film felt like an intimate view into a society that our news media portray as monochromatic and extremely foreign.

Taare Zameen Par,"An eight-year-old boy is thought to be a lazy trouble-maker, until the new art teacher has the patience and compassion to discover the real problem behind his struggles in school.","I&apos;m not always a fan of the Bollywood style of filmmaking: overrun with musical montages and exaggerated dialogue and acting. But &apos;Like Stars on Earth&apos; is a magical film about the magnificent abilities that children have, even when all the odds are against them. With a story as powerful as this one, it doesn&apos;t matter where or how the story is told.

Luckily, most of the Bollywood clichés actually enhance the film experience. Being such an integral part of the story, the soundtrack and score complement the film wonderfully. Each song aligning nicely with the film&apos;s dramatic but hopeful tone. Admittedly, having a rap song play over Ishaan&apos;s family getting dressed and ready for the day is a bit jarring, but the songs that play after Aamir Khan appear are nothing short of enchanting.

This film is about a dyslexic child who has basically given up on school as no one seems to think he&apos;s worth anything. His father beats him for goofing off and all of his teachers scold him for not being able to do the simplest of tasks. So, Ishaan finds his way to a boarding school where he meets Ram Shankar Nikumbh (Aamir Khan) who may change his life forever. Everybody had that teacher who changed the way you approached school and perhaps even life itself, which is why I thought this movie was so effective. There&apos;s nothing more gratifying than watching someone struggling to find their way, only to have one uniquely suited person put them back on track. 

It seems so simple but coming from a teaching background, I&apos;ll be the first person to say that it can be nearly impossible to connect with someone who doesn&apos;t want any help. However, when and if that connection is made, it&apos;s possibly the most fulfilling thing a person can do. Aamir Khan captures these emotions perfectly near the end of Like Stars on Earth. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll ever get the image of Ishaan&apos;s father breaking down into tears out of my head. There&apos;s some really powerful stuff here.

Per qualche dollaro in più,Two bounty hunters with the same intentions team up to track down an escaped Mexican outlaw.,"Completely defying the tried & tested Hollywood formula and introducing his own style of narration that was more character driven, glamorized violence & also added a new dimension of moral ambiguity into its characters&apos; psyche, thus bringing both heroes & villains very much on the same level, Sergio Leone presented a whole new outlook of the Wild West in A Fistful of Dollars but with this second chapter, he further accelerates the inevitable rebirth of the western genre.

The second installment of Leone&apos;s Dollars trilogy is quite an improvement over its predecessor in almost all departments of filmmaking & gradually portrays the developing maturity in Leone&apos;s craftsmanship. Starring Clint Eastwood as a bounty hunter looking for a number of wanted suspects, who later partners with another bounty hunter looking for the same guys & make a deal of splitting the reward but in the end when it comes down to final showdown, one of them shows their real motive behind the hunt.

Featuring an improved direction from Sergio Leone, For A Few Dollars More presents the director in more control of his artistry & has a much stronger script to muster ahead with. The scope of camera-work, the precision of editing & overall production design also get their upgrades plus the performances from the recurring cast turn out to be better than the previous film with Clint Eastwood & new addition of Lee Van Cleef impressing the most.

On an overall scale, For A Few Dollars More is another huge step towards placing the coffin on traditional westerns & presents a significant evolution of every single aspect of its making when compared with A Fistful of Dollars. Ennio Morricone&apos;s music also leaves a bigger mark than before & it&apos;s exciting to observe how seamlessly it accompanies the drama. A rare sequel that improves upon the original, For A Few Dollars More is absolutely recommended.",,['Western'],"['mexico', 'spaghetti western', 'wild west', 'bounty hunter', 'violence']",1967-05-10,['Sergio Leone'],"['Clint Eastwood', 'Lee Van Cleef', 'Gian Maria Volontè']","['Sergio Leone', 'Fulvio Morsella', 'Luciano Vincenzoni']"

The Father,"A man refuses all assistance from his daughter as he ages. As he tries to make sense of his changing circumstances, he begins to doubt his loved ones, his own mind and even the fabric of his reality.","The Father couldn&apos;t be more realistic when talking about Alzheimer&apos;s disease. I&apos;ve seen my grandfather walking that path. He was a smart man but once the dementia kicked in he was barely recognizable, which was a hard thing to witness when you knew him as the intellectual he was. The Father just nailed this subject, bringing back so many memories, memories we would rather forget but that you can&apos;t. Living with a loved one with this disease isn&apos;t easy at all, certainly not when that person sometimes doesn&apos;t remember who you are. I didn&apos;t knew Anthony Hopkins won an Oscar for his role, but after watching this movie I can only say it&apos;s highly deserved. It&apos;s probably one of his better performances ever, and that at 83 years old. The Father isn&apos;t a movie that will give you a lot of joy, it&apos;s sad and scary but certainly worth watching. Nobody wants to have a loved one suffering from dementia, it&apos;s a nightmare to live with. I remember my grandfather starting to smoke a cigarette like it was a thing he always did and that whilst he stopped more than forty years ago. I remember him telling me he was going crazy after asking me the same question for the twentieth time in barely an hour. He knew it was all going downhill, he knew he was a burden to everybody, and that must hurt when you are still that little bit lucid to understand that. I watched several movies about dementia but this one is just the most realistic. It&apos;s sad but that&apos;s life, everybody should watch it so they can be prepared if the disease ever would hit a loved one.",8,"['Drama', 'Mystery']","['dementia', 'alzheimer&apos;s disease', 'memory loss', 'based on play', 'father daughter relationship']",2021-02-26,['Florian Zeller'],"['Anthony Hopkins', 'Olivia Colman', 'Mark Gatiss']","['Christopher Hampton', 'Florian Zeller']"

Shutter Island,"In 1954, a U.S. Marshal investigates the disappearance of a murderer who escaped from a hospital for the criminally insane.","Shutter Island. A film that will divide the film community. A film that will leave many upset, and hating it. A film that has already completely split the critics. A movie that messes with you. And no one likes to be messed with. And that is exactly where it exceeds. Think I&apos;m contradicting myself? 

Shutter Island is one of the most well crafted psychological thrillers to come by since Silence Of The Lambs. And it is no coincidence both were brilliantly written novels. Shutter Island is adapted by a book written by Dennis Lehane (wrote gone baby, gone and mystic river). It is a book filled with twists and turns, that will leave the reader dizzy. And, that is what it&apos;s film counterpart does to the fullest. Martin Scorsese helms the director chair, in a movie where he is more free than any before. This is Scorsese at his most unrestrained. 

Marty takes what he has learned from the great films of the past and puts it into his. The master of suspense Alfred Hitchcock&apos;s influence is everywhere you look in this film. And it is no wonder, considering Scorsese even showed one of his greatest works to the crew: Vertigo. And many of those ideas are present in Shutter Island; the cliff scenes scream Hitchcock. This is a film that creeps and crawls, and is filled with dark corners. And it is all heightened by the coming storm that looms over the island. This is classic film noir. 

The story follows Teddy, a federal Marshall, and his partner Chuck (Played by DiCaprio and Ruffulo). They go to this mysterious island enveloped in fog to investigate an escape. From these opening scenes, Marty has set up a dark and creepy premise. 

Almost the whole movie incorporates this story as Teddy desperately tries to find the truths he seeks. Teddy is shown as a scared man; a man of war and violence as portrayed in various flashbacks. These will go on to be increasingly important as the story progresses. We follow Teddy on his quest, through every dark corridor and perilous confrontations. Slowly, we are given pieces to the puzzle, but the audience does not even realize it. For we, like Teddy, are blind. For the moment at least. It is because of this that the thrilling conclusion will leave many blindsided. But, you see, that is where this thriller becomes something more. We as the audience are put in Teddy&apos;s shoes, and we feel all the things he feels. It is a complete assault on the senses, and it works beautifully. 

This is a film you must watch carefully. That is another thing that sets this apart, it is a horror film that makes you actually think. In this day and age, I&apos;m not surprised some found it terrible esp. after their brains have been turned to mush by these new gore filled horror films. Scorsese&apos;s ultimate goal here is to wake you up. And trust me, you probably wont like it. 

This is also a film I would recommend seeing a second time. In fact, it is even better the second time. All those pieces of that puzzle you didn&apos;t catch the first time, you will the second. You see, we as the audience are first put in the shoes of Teddy. The second? Well, without giving too much away, lets just say you are put in someones else&apos;s shoes entirely during the second viewing. 

Shutter Island. A film that will make you question your own sanity. A film that will leave you breathless. A film that has re-ignited the thriller genre. A film that will leave you, and the main character, searching for answers.

Jurassic Park,A pragmatic paleontologist touring an almost complete theme park on an island in Central America is tasked with protecting a couple of kids after a power failure causes the park&apos;s cloned dinosaurs to run loose.,"In the year 1993, Hollywood saw something unlike anything else, the film Jurassic Park. Never before 1993 had dinosaurs been so breathtaking and realistic on the silver screen.

The plot is very original. A group of scientists cloned dinosaurs, and are about to open an amusement park where people can see the dinosaurs. The creator John Hammond(Richard Attenborough) invites a group of people, along with his grandchildren, to see the dinos and enjoy a relaxing time at the park. Could anything go wrong, at the time it doesn&apos;t seem like it, but something else is going on. Employee Dennis Nedry is planning to steal dinosaur embryos. In order to do this, he causes a security breakdown so he can get the embryos and escape. He isn&apos;t the only one that can escape, as hungry dinos also escape. After this, everyone on the island is in danger, and loose dinosaurs are everywhere. That is where the fun in Jurassic Park comes in.

This is an underrated movie according to the IMDb ratings. It isn&apos;t even in the top 250. Today, people don&apos;t appreciate it as much, mainly due to the fact that other movies like it have been made. Growing up in the 90&apos;s, this was one of my favorite movies. As a kid, I only watched it to see the dinosaurs, as I didn&apos;t understand a whole lot of it. Today, I realize how great the plotting and suspense are.

This spawned two sequels. The second one wasn&apos;t bad, but the third wasn&apos;t very good. I would recommend seeing the second after this, but the third is passable.

The story is great, how at first we see how the magic was created, and then later we see the magic turn into a disaster, in which everyone&apos;s life is at stake.

The special effects are still good today, but they were revolutionary for back in 1993. The acting is good, and the ensemble cast is great. All of the action sequences are perfectly executed, creating plenty of suspense and tension.

Younger kids may get scared by this, as I remember a lot of young kids being scared by it in 1993. If kids aren&apos;t scared by dinosaurs, they will probably enjoy the movie.

I highly recommend Jurassic Park. It is quite underrated in my opinion, it deserves more credit than it gets.

Watch this at all costs if you have somehow missed it and see what everyone was amazed about back in 1993.

Monty Python and the Holy Grail,"King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table embark on a surreal, low-budget search for the Holy Grail, encountering many, very silly obstacles.","Being brought up on Python going to see this movie on its original release was one of the highlights of my movie going childhood. For many years I thought &apos;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&apos; was the funniest movie ever made. Now over twenty five years later repetition and familiarity may not have ruined the movie completely but they have spoiled my enjoyment somewhat. Even so it&apos;s still a comedy classic and I envy anyone who is watching it for the first time. Python (Cleese, Chapman, Palin, Jones, Idle and Gilliam) were on top form throughout, and apart from one or two less successful bits it&apos;s hilarious stuff, and arguably their most consistent movie. (I still think their TV work was their best, the non-linear sketch format suiting their style more than extended pieces). Python bores can quote this verbatim but don&apos;t let them put you off. This is one wacked out romp full of fun and surprises, and still has more laughs than 90% of today&apos;s so-called comedies.

The Great Escape,Allied prisoners of war plan for several hundred of their number to escape from a German camp during World War II.,"Credit should be given to the brilliant score by Elmer Bernstein. If you listen to it closely, it literally is a battle between the Allied Prisoners (flutes & woodwinds) and the Germans (tubas). The escape scenes with the little boat on the scenic german river is evocative of Wagner and his heroic Germanic Operas. The scenery of the German countryside and the Alps is breathtaking. I believe that the scriptwriters emphasized the heroism, humor, and character of the prisoners to make an uplifting statement of what is essentially a cruel and tragic story. As a child growing up in the seventies, our 7th grade glass was reading the Paul Brickhill book and we had the opportunity to meet a former (American) Stalag Luft III prisoner from that era. He had arrived at the camp after the Great Escape, but was placed on the monument detail for the 50 executed men. He said that few men seriously contemplated escape after this incident and the emphasis was on surviving the war and going home alive.",,"['Adventure', 'Drama', 'History']","['escape from prison', 'airforce officer', 'luftwaffe', 'wehrmacht', 'escape']",1963-07-04,['John Sturges'],"['Steve McQueen', 'James Garner', 'Richard Attenborough']","['Paul Brickhill', 'James Clavell', 'W.R.

Kill Bill: Vol. 1,"After awakening from a four-year coma, a former assassin wreaks vengeance on the team of assassins who betrayed her.","Pros: 1.

The entire animated sequence of the O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu) origin story is gorgeously animated, as well as being impactful and brutal. 3.

The editing is mostly top-notch, especially with the quick cuts adding a lot of vibrancy to the fight scenes. 6. The costume and set design create the outlandish world perfectly. 7. Both Uma Thurman (The Bride) and Lucy Liu deliver great performances. 8. The sound-mixing is very crisp and clean, and it adds so much weight to the action scenes. 9. The make-up and art production is off-the-charts and, in regards to the gore, helps to make the deaths to feel more potent in their execution.

Rashômon,"The rape of a bride and the murder of her samurai husband are recalled from the perspectives of a bandit, the bride, the samurai&apos;s ghost and a woodcutter.","As oppose to its commonplace plot, Rashomon as a concept is extraordinarily idiosyncratic and perhaps it is this striking attribute that makes it an undisputed masterpiece, howsoever improbable. It vividly limns the artistry of contrivance innate in the human psyche owing to the importunate desire of humans to placate their insatiable egos. This manipulation of facts has no limits and entirely depends upon the skill of imaginative improvisation of the individual along with his level of comfort at skullduggery. The ability to misinterpret comes naturally to the humans as a desperate ploy to counter the adversities of life and that&apos;s what makes it indispensable. As a direct consequence of contrivance, the concept of truth no longer remains universal but becomes rather subjective and a matter of individualistic perception. 

Rashomon pioneered Kurosawa&apos;s dream tryst with perpetual brilliance and undoubtedly played a pivotal part in making his name a mark of excellence in the world of cinema. Rashomon is a well knitted tale about a supercilious samurai, his whimsical wife and a boorish bandit. The bandit inveigles the samurai into imprisonment and has his way with samurai&apos;s wife. The dead body of the samurai is later discovered under mysterious circumstances by a woodcutter. The bandit is captured and arraigned along with the deranged widow of the samurai. Their narrated versions seem such contrasting that a psychic is called upon to conjure up the dead samurai&apos;s spirit to record his testimony in order to corroborate the facts that seemed excessively manipulated. The samurai&apos;s version yet again differs considerably from the testimonies of the other two. Each version though different seemed to satiate the respective ego of the testifier. The woodcutter, who didn&apos;t want to get involved personally, later confesses to a priest to have actually witnessed the incident and comes up with a version of his own which falsifies the other three. The movie is ingenious as its actual motive has nothing to do with the revelation of truth as verity is merely a matter of lame perception, but rather is to highlight the discrepancies among the different versions as a medium to depict the irrational complexities associated with the human psyche. 

The concept of Rashomon though well ahead of its time, sowed the seeds for creative innovation in the world of cinema and has served as the undisputed benchmark of innovative excellence for well over five decades. A quintessential Kurosawa classic, strongly recommended to the masses for its sheer brilliance and enigmatic charm. 10/10",10,"['Crime', 'Drama', 'Mystery']","['unreliable narration', 'medium', 'contradictory accounts', 'multiple perspectives', 'rape']",1951-12-26,['Akira Kurosawa'],"['Toshirô Mifune', 'Machiko Kyô', 'Masayuki Mori']","['Ryûnosuke Akutagawa', 'Akira Kurosawa', 'Shinobu Hashimoto']"

On this epic voyage he gets to battle sharks, surf with some turtle dudes, dice with some jellyfish and survive an encounter in a whales stomach.

All the characters are vibrant with Disney charm, but my favourite is Dory, the comic relief, probably one of the funniest Disney characters ever written and superbly voiced by Ellen DeGeneres, pure genius.

Raging Bull,"The life of boxer Jake LaMotta, whose violence and temper that led him to the top in the ring destroyed his life outside of it.","Raging Bull is one of Martin Scorsese&apos;s best films and with out a doubt the best film of the 80&apos;s. It follows the career of middleweight boxing champion Jake LaMotta as his career progresses but his emotional problems worsen.

The most notable feature in Raging Bull is the colour. All but the home Video footage is shot in black and white. This was a huge risk on Scorsase&apos;s part but it defiantly pays off, the film wouldn&apos;t feel the same had it been done in colour.

Throughout the entire film acting is simply impeccable. De Niro and Pesci are both stunning. The script is amazing, you really feel like you understand every character, none of their actions seem out of character no matter how outrageous they may be.

Scorsese&apos;s directing is stunning. He really is a very talented director and in Raging Bull it shows. The fight scenes are famous for their brutal realism and it&apos;s easy to see why. He puts you right in the ring with the fighters and you cant help but admire their technical brilliance. However, the most stunning aspect of all is Thelma Schoonmaker&apos;s editing. Its some of the best editing I&apos;ve ever seen especially during the fight scenes where it&apos;s positively breathtaking.

No matter what happens you always find yourself sympathising with La Motta, even during his most outrageous moments. Not only is Raging Bull the greatest film to come out of the 80&apos;s but is one of the greatest this century that&apos;s highly underrated and defiantly worth owning.

It seemed a tad too cartoonish in the first few minutes so we gave up on it when we first tried to watch many years ago.

Dial M for Murder,A former tennis star arranges the murder of his adulterous wife.,"I had forgotten that most if not all of it happens in one single room.

Prisoners,"When Keller Dover&apos;s daughter and her friend go missing, he takes matters into his own hands as the police pursue multiple leads and the pressure mounts.","Prisoners, the new film from Canadian director Denis Villeneuve (Polytechnique), is a top notch nail-biting crime-drama that is as good a theatre as modern Hollywood has the ability to produce. 

Hugh Jackman and Maria Bello play the parental figures of the Dover family. They are your average hard-working blue-collar family who begin their story by visiting neighbours Franklin and Nancy Birch (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis) for a Thanksgiving dinner. The Franklins and the Dover&apos;s each have two children, the youngest of which (Anna and Joy) head out from their home on a November afternoon to play only to mysteriously disappear. 

Upon a frantic search, the Franklins and the Dover&apos;s suspect the worse. Especially when their elder children tell them of a mysterious camper that was parked just down the street. Police soon find the camper with Alex Jones (Paul Dano) behind the wheel. Alex has the mentality of a 10-year-old and tries fleeing when surrounded by authorities. But when Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) begins to interrogate Alex, he is less convinced that Alex was a part of the abduction. As days pass, Loki and Keller Doller work in opposite directions on the investigation. Keller is convinced that Alex Jones was a part of the abduction and kidnaps the frail and challenged Jones and tortures him for days in an attempt to extract answers. Meanwhile, Detective Loki follows leads that open up possibilities of a crime where multiple persons may be involved. And Oscar nominee Melissa Leo appears in a supporting but pivotal role that will assist in the closure.

The trailer for Prisoners may have audiences hearkening back to Ron Howard&apos;s Ransom, but this is hardly the cookie-cutter kidnapping film that Mel Gibson lead back in 1996. Prisoners instead is an engulfing drama. One with a superb performance by lead Hugh Jackman that challenges how far someone would/should go in an effort to locate their stolen child. 

The script, from writer Aaron Guzikowski (Contrband) takes audiences down many different paths and emotional rides and Jackman&apos;s performance will have you rooting for his quest for answers even though his methods are unorthodox and highly illegal.

The film is gritty and full of realistic characters and situations culminating in a perfect ending that goes 9/10ths of the way in giving its audience full closure. Not as much an edge-of-your seat thriller as it is a Zodiac type of crime drama where the stakes are the lives of two small children. 

Denis Villeneuve&apos;s last effort, Incendies, was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Film in 2011. Prisoners shows that he can move solidly into big star larger scaled films with the ease of a well worn slipper. And Prisoners catapults Villeneuve into not just a director to watch, but a director whose work should be awaited with palpable excitement.

Fargo,Minnesota car salesman Jerry Lundegaard&apos;s inept crime falls apart due to his and his henchmen&apos;s bungling and the persistent police work of the quite pregnant Marge Gunderson.,"Fargo is a great piece of movie. It has a strong story and a strong cast. It&apos;s down to earth and believable.

Jerry Lundegaard is in some trouble. He hires two small time crocks from Fargo to kidnap his wife. The plan is for her father to pay off and for Jerry to take the money. Things don&apos;t exactly goes as planned as they kill three people and get a pregnant Chief on their tail.

The Coen brothers have does a terrific job on this movie. It&apos;s a well written, original story with an original setting and it doesn&apos;t try to be anything it isn&apos;t. Just a few characters, a simple plot and small scale. They stay away of clichés and don&apos;t even remotely try to mix in anything of that regular Hollywood crap. They manage to capture the mood, the people and the action pretty good. The characters are great, they&apos;re reasonable and believable. They manage to keep it serious, but not too serious and put inn a joke here and there.

The actors are great. They way they manage to put on a happy smile and make it seem polite and a little, but not all too false in a great way. William H. Macy is great as Jerry Lundegaard. He gives a little nervous, kind of boy scout performance and it fits perfect. Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare makes two great small time losers. Buscemi is great as a small, funny looking, constant talking bad guy and Stormare fits the big silent, violent, psychopath type really good and they act these characters all the way out. Kristin Rudrüd does a good job as Jean Lundegaard and Harve Presnell as the rich dad is always a winner.

The cinematography is good. All of the shots are good looking and some of them are original, cool and extra good looking. All of the shots are well composed, the lightning is good, but not much out of the ordinary. There are a nice play with the colors in some shots involving the snow.

The score is really nice. The theme is a little sad and so is the movie. It&apos;s moody and supports the action and fits the settings very well. It&apos;s used in a classical way between the action and that works very well, it makes the action seem more real and more close.

Fargo is a original movie out of the ordinary. The story is good, well written and it&apos;s well brought to life and captured. The Coen brothers has made a timeless and very enjoyable movie. See it!",8,"['Crime', 'Thriller']","['black comedy', 'botched crime', 'dark comedy', 'snow', 'fargo north dakota']",1996-04-05,"['Joel Coen', 'Ethan Coen']","['William H.

Gran Torino,,"seeing the trailer for this film kinda made me expect id be watching Dirty Harry in the suburbs.

What I saw was a bittersweet superbly written, well acted story of humanity and friendship,this film is something that we can all relate to in some way, and isn&apos;t Hollywooded up in anyway, the film tells it story without any un needed hidden undertones that so many mainstream directors do to films.

Eastwood is excellent as the hard nosed war vet, and his direction is perfect as always, and supporting cast did there job just fine too

Clint Eastwood was perfect for the role and as director, as he has the knack of taking a story and making a film for the audience to get sucked into the story, and not for critics to pick apart....great film making,",9,['Drama'],"['widower', 'gang', 'teenager', 'street gang', 'gang rape']",2009-01-09,['Clint Eastwood'],"['Clint Eastwood', 'Bee Vang', 'Christopher Carley']","['Nick Schenk', 'Dave Johannson']"
Tonari no Totoro,"When two girls move to the country to be near their ailing mother, they have adventures with the wondrous forest spirits who live nearby.","Like all Miyazaki films, this one is absolutely sacred. Some parts are reminiscent of Laputa: Castle in the Sky and Spirited Away (and Alice in Wonderland by extension), but Totoro stands out as probably the most unique of them all.

The premise is nice and simple, which works brilliantly because the plot is established as a foundation without hindering the experience of the movie itself. The viewer is allowed unrestricted access and exploration of the messages offered by the film.

In addition, Totoro is not bound by any rules of traditional storytelling. Instead, it presents occurrences that touch on a fundamental human level that is so deep and profound that it will have you feeling a range of emotions. There are so many layers to this movie, each one meaningful and special. From community building to the love of a family to sibling relationships to facing the unknown; everyone can take away something personal from this movie.

Perhaps the most sacred aspect of the film, however, is that it reminds us that life is magical. Not all of us have a neighbor like Totoro, but we are all fortunate in different ways. Each of us has something to treasure, something that brings joy and comfort.

Totoro is special in that it frees the viewer to be a child again and to contemplate the world through a perspective that we have perhaps forgotten. Everything is new and interesting and beautiful, from a crumbling porch to an acorn seed. We live in a magical world, and it is definitely worth taking the time to appreciate this.",10,"['Animation', 'Comedy', 'Family']","['sister sister relationship', 'studio ghibli', 'sick mother', 'father daughter relationship', 'ill mother']",1990-07-13,['Hayao Miyazaki'],"['Hitoshi Takagi', 'Noriko Hidaka', 'Chika Sakamoto']",['Hayao Miyazaki']
Catch Me If You Can,"Barely 21 yet, Frank is a skilled forger who has passed as a doctor, lawyer and pilot.

DiCaprio gives a grandly charming performance as Frank Abagnale, Jr. a teenager who adopted the professional guises of airplane pilot, physician and lawyer to front his check kiting schematic modus operandi during the 1960s and eventually making the FBI&apos;s most wanted list by bilking millions until his capture and imprisonment. Based on Abagnale&apos;s best-selling memoir and adapted with lean storytelling by Jeff Nathanson, the film never lets up in the giddy cat-and-mouse/Road Runner/Wile E. Coyote relationship between fugitive DiCaprio and amalgamated FBI square Hanks (replete with thick as clam chowder Boston accent, dorky specs and porkpie hat) one step behind his two-steps ahead prey and a unique dynamic of a father/son esthetic.

The Gold Rush,"A prospector goes to the Klondike during the 1890s gold rush in hopes of making his fortune, and is smitten with a girl he sees in a dance hall.","Very good Charles Chaplin in which he proves his excellent skill as an actor and director . The Little tramp searches for gold and romance in the Klondike , Alaska , in the mid-1800s . Along the way he gets mixed up with some burly roles and he falls in love by the charming dancer Georgia , furthermore , he finds in competition with a jealous suitor who has his eyes on Georgia , as well . And while facing off other prospectors and suffering extreme starvation, and anything else.

This is his most critically acclaimed movie being a real masterpiece. The picture had success at box office and the general public liked it very much , especially the scenes of the rolls dance , Chaplin tied a dog while dancing on the hall , the old cabin hanging on the cliff , among others . The best denomination of his simple approach to movie form, adept maneuvering of visual pathos . Includes lovely music , unforgettable and classic scenes as Chaplin and his colleague have dinner old shoes and the hilarious dance of the rolls.

This was one of the his first longest films to that date . Chaplin formerly had directed short films of 1, 2 , or 3 reels , such as : Our hero, Night at the show , The fireman , The adventurer , The count , The floor walker , The Circus , The cure , The inmigrant , Burlesque on Carmen , 3 Charlies anda phone , Shoulder arms , and several others . Shortly after , he directed long time films as The Gold Rush , The kid , City lights , Modern times, The great dictator , Monsieur Verdoux , Limelight , A king in New York , and his last one , A countess from Hong Kong . Rating : 8/10 . ¨The picture I want to be remembered by¨-Charles Chaplin . Better than average . Well worth watching .

Before Sunrise,"A young man and woman meet on a train in Europe, and wind up spending one evening together in Vienna. Unfortunately, both know that this will probably be their only night together.","Before Sunrise is romance for the slacker generation. Richard Linklater&apos;s romantic drama is an offbeat telling of a dream come true for most people. The film depicts romance in all it&apos;s glory, but without any of the pitfalls that befall most couples; and in short the film is about two people that have a relationship that&apos;s as close to perfection as relationships will ever come to - with just one problem, the problem of time. While most relationships wind down with time, this one keeps going strong throughout and time itself is the only thing that wears out. Before Sunrise is certainly not the typical sentimental &apos;Hollywood romance&apos;, which is another aspect that puts this film leagues ahead of the pretenders. The story follows two people, Jesse; an American and Celine; a French girl that meet on a train into Vienna. They instantly connect, and after telling her his awful idea for a television show and almost getting off the train, Jesse asks Celine to join him for the day in the picturesque city of Vienna...

Before Sunrise works principally for two reasons - realistic acting and an immense script that builds the characters through their thoughts and feelings and thus allows us to get to know them as we do the people in real life. This allows the characters to be free, and it&apos;s easy to believe that these are real people and not just actors working from a script. This also allows us to feel for the characters for who they are, and not merely because they&apos;re the protagonists. This kind of realism is hard to capture as, at the end of the day, we as the audience know that they&apos;re watching a film and not observing real life; but Before Sunrise represents one of the truest to life exhibitions of realism ever to be seen on screen. A truly great script cannot work on it&apos;s own, and needs great actors to deliver it to an extent that does it justice, and although I&apos;m not a fan of either Julie Deply or Ethan Hawke; on viewing this film, there is nothing you can do but give them both respect. I don&apos;t know whether they were in character or just playing themselves, but when a film is this good; it hardly matters.

In a film like this, it is the writing that&apos;s the most important thing, and contained within the script are several observations about life, most of which I personally could relate to. This represents what Richard Linklater has achieved with this script as not only does it create and build the characters, but it also manages to expose what true love is, along with several other aspects of life. The fact that not all the anecdotes are relatable to me personally again represents the brilliance of writing. Everyone is different, and so different parts of the script will appeal to different people. There could be certain aspects about one person that one person loves and another hates; and that&apos;s the case with the musings in this script. Adding to the beauty of the film is the city of Vienna. The city itself isn&apos;t really important to the film as this is a story that could have taken place just about anywhere - but it makes for some lovely visuals and the upbeat, energetic romance that blossoms throughout the movie is matched by the beauty of the location.

Before Sunrise is simultaneously beautiful and captivating. Richard Linklater has created something that is rare in the world of cinema; a film that captures the beauty of life without ever going over the top or being overly sentimental. Before Sunrise is what it is. And what it is, is pure cinematic brilliance.",9,"['Drama', 'Romance']","['conversations', 'train', 'tourist', 'kiss', 'eurail pass']",1995-01-27,['Richard Linklater'],"['Ethan Hawke', 'Julie Delpy', 'Andrea Eckert']","['Richard Linklater', 'Kim Krizan']"
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2,"Harry, Ron, and Hermione search for Voldemort&apos;s remaining Horcruxes in their effort to destroy the Dark Lord as the final battle rages on at Hogwarts.","The conclusion to the series hits some of the strongest emotional beats, mainly due to our long-standing connection with the characters, and provides some grand visual treats in the form of extended magical battles. While &apos;Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows: Part 2 (2011)&apos; may be the biggest in scale and it is entertaining, it does feel lacking in depth - since some things are left oddly unexplained - and instead comes across as an extended third act for its duration. It actually plays out like one long climax, with little of the build-up required to further invest the audience, but at least it&apos;s well paced and doesn&apos;t hang about. A strong note on which to end a phenomenal series. 8/10",8,"['Adventure', 'Family', 'Fantasy']","['friendship', 'snake', 'ginny weasley character', 'lucius malfoy character', 'hermione granger character']",2011-07-15,['David Yates'],"['Daniel Radcliffe', 'Emma Watson', 'Rupert Grint']","['Steve Kloves', 'J.K.

It is a tale within a tale within another tale. Whilst every shot has been meticulously arranged as though a work of Art hanging in a museum, story wise Anderson has let his imagination run wild. Though the tale (with Tom Wilkinson as the author of the story) and the tale within the tale (with Jude Law as the young author & F Murray Abraham as the mysterious owner of THe Grand Budapest Hotel) have straightforward narratives, the tale within the tale within the tale, which comprises the bulk of the film and is set in the years preceding the Second World War, is a wild uproarious train ride of story telling. It also boasts the cast of a life time: Ralph Fiennes, Tilda Swinton, Edward Norton, Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Harvey Keitel, Jeff Goldblum, Bill Murray, Owen Wilson & countless cameos. It will delight Anderson fans but is more likely destined for Art house cinemas as it is too off center for mainstream audiences.

Smultronstället,"After living a life marked by coldness, an aging professor is forced to confront the emptiness of his existence.","(Slight Spoilers) A man&apos;s life journey is all seen through a number of dreams and hallucinations on his trip, some 400 miles, to the town of Lund where he&apos;s to receive a lifetime achievement award for his 50 or so years of service to his fellow man as a doctor and a professor of medicine at his alma mater the Cathedral of Lund.

Disturbed by a dream he had the night before Isak Borg decides to take a ride by car, not plane, to Lund for a ceremony thats to be in his honor for his work as a man of medicine. Isak&apos;s maid for some 40 years Agda is very upset with her boss&apos; and good friends decision and decides to stay at home, she&apos;ll eventually show up at the ceremony, feeling that the old man has somehow lost control of his senses. It turns out that the long car trip together with his daughter-in-law Marianne was one of the best decision that he made in his long life, Isak is 78 years old. The trip that Isak takes will bring back past memories that he so desperately tried to hide from himself. That past will in effect make him not only a better person but bring back the feeling of humanity that he lost not only for himself over these long and empty years. Not only for Isak but for those close to him whom he more or less also lost contact with. Isak,in both his dreams and memories, is seen as a man who is unable to show any real feelings for those around and close to him in the fear of either being rejected as well as showing himself to be hurt by their negative responses.

This defect in Isak personality has cost him the love of his life Sara when he was a young man who rejected him for his handsome and openly aggressive older brother Sigfried. We also see that Isak&apos;s marriage to his wife, who had long since passed away, Karin was anything but happy with her disgusted with his inability to show her any real feelings and emotions as a husband. Were also shown, in one of Isak&apos;s dreams, that she had an affair with another man Ake Fridell, who was anything but passive with her like her husband Isak was, some 40 years ago behind his back. That may have possibly resulted in the birth of his only child his son, who&apos;s also a doctor, Evald Marriane&apos;s husband.

Seeing his 96 year-old mother on his way to Lund we see in her the same human defect that he has in that all of her ten children, who with the exception of Isak are now deceased, never bothered to visit her in her old age. The only time that they had anything to do with her was when they wanted money from the old lady. This coldness and inability to have any attachment to her children is shown not only in both Isak and his mother but in his son Evald who&apos;s so disgusted with life and what it had to offer him, like a beautiful and caring wife like Marianne. Evald threatened to walk out on Marianne when after he found out of her being pregnant, I guess by him, she refused his demand of her getting an abortion.

Isak is helped on his long trip to Lund not only by Marianne but a number of people they meet and in some cases give a ride along the way. This included a young girl and two of her friend going on a trip to Italy ironically named Sara, a virtual twin of the Sara that he loved and lost as a young man. Later Sara together with Anders and Victor who later as a singing group serenade a surprised and grateful, to the point of tears, Isak after he received his award. Meeting among others along the way to far flung Lund a bickering couple Mr. & Mrs. Alman, who almost had Isak and his passengers killed in a head-on car crash. Isak also met a gas station attendant, Henrik, who was so impressed and grateful by what he did for him and his wife in the past , delivered their first child, that he refused to get paid for filling up Isak&apos;s gas-tank.

By the time Isak got to Lund and received his lifetime achievement award to the attendance and cheering of the entire town he not only realized all the good that he did as a man of medicine all these years but also all the hurt that he gave to others, if unintentional. With the little time that he has left, Isak was to pass away three years later at the age of 81, Isak is determined to make up for it.

Sweet touching yet simple little film about one man&apos;s journey back in time who sees how he missed out on the many wonderful things that life had to offer him by being blind to them. Now given a second chance Isak would try as best as he can to both re-live and at the same time correct his past mistakes.",8,"['Drama', 'Romance']","['professor', 'road movie', 'nostalgia', 'dream', 'swedish summer']",1959-06-22,['Ingmar Bergman'],"['Victor Sjöström', 'Bibi Andersson', 'Ingrid Thulin']",['Ingmar Bergman']

Barry Lyndon,An Irish rogue wins the heart of a rich widow and assumes her dead husband&apos;s aristocratic position in 18th-century England.,"Kubrick&apos;s adaptation of Thackeray&apos;s Barry Lyndon sharply divides fans of the great director&apos;s work, as the languid pace and seemingly interminable running time -- not to mention Ryan O&apos;Neal&apos;s questionable performance in the title role -- are cherished by some and deplored by others. Little argument will be made against John Alcott&apos;s Academy Award-winning cinematography or Ken Adam&apos;s production design, however, and Kubrickian motifs are manifest in the gallery of characters&apos; wide-ranging displays of cowardice, guile, duplicity, avarice, jealousy, greed, and cruelty. Marisa Berenson is terribly short-changed in her role as the Lady Lyndon, but a number of other performers are given the opportunity to create a handful of memorable moments -- especially Arthur O&apos;Sullivan (albeit briefly) as the charming, intelligent highwayman and Patrick Magee as the Chevalier. Love it or hate it, Barry Lyndon will remain essential viewing for aficionados of the director, who enjoys taking his usual shots at the more discouraging aspects of human behavior.",,"['Adventure', 'Drama', 'War']","['18th century', 'gambler', 'stepfather stepson conflict', 'voice over narration', 'social climber']",1975-12-18,['Stanley Kubrick'],"['Ryan O&apos;Neal', 'Marisa Berenson', 'Patrick Magee']","['Stanley Kubrick', 'William Makepeace Thackeray']"
The Deer Hunter,An in-depth examination of the ways in which the Vietnam War impacts and disrupts the lives of several friends in a small steel mill town in Pennsylvania.,"I can identify a lot with The Deer Hunter because my mother&apos;s family were of Ukranian background and my relatives on her side were a whole lot like the people we see here from Clairton, Pennsylvania. They worked in the same factory jobs that these men do and answered the call of their country at war, but in a whole different time. And the grandson of one my uncles recently served in Iraq as a marine.

Make no mistake about it, these people for all their personal faults are the backbone of America. They are the folks whose blood gets spilled in the wars we fight. So when they are called it had better not be in an unrighteous or fruitless cause.

Robert DeNiro, Christopher Walken, and John Savage are three mill workers from small town Clairton, Pennsylvania. All from Slavic background as my family is and in a time when those of us more educated and more sophisticated and knowing better dodge the draft, these guys enlist and go to Vietnam. The Deer Hunter is about the effects of that war on all of them and all around them.

John Savage gets overlooked a lot with both Robert DeNiro being nominated for Best Actor and Christopher Walken winning for Best Supporting Actor, but Savage is the guy most physically damaged, losing a leg as a result of the escape all three make from a Viet Cong prison. He&apos;s growing quite accustomed to what he calls the country club of the VA hospital he&apos;s in and can&apos;t bring himself to come home.

Robert DeNiro is a hunter on weekends, as were some in my family. But the sure marksman from before Vietnam, after having to kill people to stay alive, is not about killing defenseless deer any longer. Meryl Streep plays the woman who loves both DeNiro and Walken and she&apos;s so totally immersed in her role and her role&apos;s ethnic background, I could swear she was one of my relatives.

Christopher Walken will blow you away with his performance of the man totally unhinged by his capture with the Viet Cong and the Russian Roulette games they play with the captives. His final confrontation with DeNiro will move you beyond words.

Michael Cimino who directed and co-wrote the screenplay got an Oscar for the film and himself and deserved every bit of it. Acclaimed the new genius of the cinema, his next project proved to be an overblown disaster, Heaven&apos;s Gate. Not that that film was as bad as it was made out to be, but Cimino&apos;s career plummeted and never really got back on track.

28 years later I remember the Oscar ceremonies in 1979 when a dying John Wayne presented the Best Picture Oscar for The Deer Hunter. Ironic also because one of the cast member, John Cazale who played one of the friends in Clairton and best remembered for being Freddo Corleone in The Godfather also was dying of cancer while the film was being shot.

Although I find it a bit too coincidental that three men from the same small town who join the Army would have the exact same service record, The Deer Hunter isn&apos;t really about the Vietnam War. It&apos;s about war and what it can do those that serve and to those around them.

And this review is dedicated to those that serve.",9,"['Drama', 'War']","['russian roulette', 'vietnam war veteran', 'vietnam war', 'wedding reception', 'soldier']",1979-02-23,['Michael Cimino'],"['Robert De Niro', 'Christopher Walken', 'John Cazale']","['Michael Cimino', 'Deric Washburn', 'Louis Garfinkle']"
Le salaire de la peur,"In a decrepit South American village, four men are hired to transport an urgent nitroglycerine shipment without the equipment that would make it safe.","Clouzot rarely gets the attention he deserves. He made not one, but two of the greatest thrillers of all time, &apos;Les Diaboliques&apos; and &apos;The Wages Of Fear&apos;, both perfect examples of how to make genuinely suspenseful movies that build up an amazing amount of tension. Most so-called thrillers made in Hollywood these days are thrillers in name only and could learn a lesson or two from these movie classics. &apos;The Wages Of Fear&apos; could even be described as an action movie, but it is a CHARACTER DRIVEN action movie, and that&apos;s what makes it so special. Modern audiences with MTV attention spans might find the plot a little slow, but I think the first half of the movie, which deals with the motley collection of exiles in a poor Latin American town, is not only fascinating in itself, but really makes a massive impact on the second half. By taking his time introducing the characters and exploring their relationships and possible motivations, Clouzet adds depth and meaning to the rest of the exciting story, something very rarely achieved in this type of movie since. The cast, every single one of them, are flawless. The four leads, Mario, the fairly decent guy played by yves Montand, his new best friend the shifty M. Jo (Charles Vanel), his old pal the kind hearted Luigi (Folco Lulli), and the enigmatic Bimba (Peter van Eyck), are all brilliant. Great performances, taut and imaginative direction, crisp and impressive cinematography, and a handful of the most riveting sequences ever committed to film make &apos;Wages Of Fear&apos; a truly unforgettable experience.

Buster Keaton playing the role of the movie projectionist Sherlock Jr. was very entertaining. The story is simple, yet interesting and fun, and the movie comes in at much less than one hour, 44 minutes to be exact.

Relatos salvajes,Six short stories that explore the extremities of human behavior involving people in distress.,"These are six wild tales. (1) Various strangers board a plane and find they all know Gabriel Pasternak. (2) An arrogant man walks into a desolate diner. The waitress recognizes him as the loan shark who drove her father to commit suicide. The cook pushes her to put rat poison in the food. (3) A city guy in a nice car gets into an escalating fight with a brute in an old rundown car on a desert highway. (4) A demolition expert gets his car towed. He tries to fight the system which spiral out of control. (5) A young man is in a hit-and-run which kills a pregnant woman. His family hires the gardener to take the criminal charge in exchange for a large payout. (6) At her wedding party, Romina uncovers her groom Ariel had cheated on her. This sends her on a downward spiral.

I rarely like all the vignettes in an anthology. Number 3 is my favorite. It goes down a rabbit hole and keeps going and going. It&apos;s relentless and fun. Number 5 is probably my least favorite. I would recommend Fargo season 2 TV show for a hit-and-run story. Number 1 is like a Twilight Zone episode. I&apos;m not sure about Number 6 until the final scene. I love the way it ends and closes the movie in grand fashion.",8,"['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Thriller']","['anthology film', 'suicide by airplane crash', 'revenge', 'wedding party', 'road rage']",2014-08-21,['Damián Szifron'],"['Darío Grandinetti', 'María Marull', 'Mónica Villa']","['Julian Loyola', 'Damián Szifron', 'Germán Servidio']"
Mr. & Mrs. Smith,A bored married couple is surprised to learn that they are both assassins hired by competing agencies to kill each other.,"Since going through most recent action movies is like chewing through cardboard, Mr. and Mrs. Smith is pleasantly energetic for an action flick. Mr. Smith and Mrs. Smith is good fun, and does a decent job of satisfying the occasional need for summer-movies.

The effectiveness of the film lies in the exploration of what happens to a failing marriage when the couple are at their wits end ... and ... for the first time, come to realize that the other is a professional assassin ... and ... subsequently push the ceiling on what is termed &apos;spousal abuse&apos; ... and ... of course, get to play with guns.

The success of the film, however, lies in how Jolie and Pitt actually bother to exercise some of their acting talent. They look like they are having fun, and genuinely enjoy the other (surprise! surprise!). The chemistry is good, and the actors are super sexy, which is always a plus for any film.

The movie fails, naturally, when the ending summarily degenerates into what is expected of action-fare, the shootouts, gun battles, and kisses. Enjoyable, nonetheless, even on its final wonky legs.

(Note: it is also a shame that in a film with so much shooting that no one gets to shoot Mr. Vince Vaughn. My, is that guy a terrible actor who can&apos;t resist hiding himself.)",7,"['Action', 'Comedy', 'Crime']","['secret agent', 'character names as title', 'wife hits husband', 'pump action shotgun', 'tough girl']",2005-06-10,['Doug Liman'],"['Brad Pitt', 'Angelina Jolie', 'Adam Brody']",['Simon Kinberg']

Mary and Max.,"A tale of friendship between two unlikely pen pals: Mary, a lonely, eight-year-old girl living in the suburbs of Melbourne, and Max, a forty-four-year old, severely obese man living in New York.","I went into this film at the Berlinale with mixed feelings. I knew that Adam Elliot&apos;s shorts were great but frankly the last few years haven&apos;t been great for Australian films and a number of short filmmakers have made disappointing first features.

But right from the opening frame, this film shattered any of my doubts. It&apos;s so refreshing to see a film told with such a strong unique vision and pulled off so effortlessly. This is made even more remarkable not only as it&apos;s made using stop motion animation but also because of the characters and subject matter it tackles.

Mary is an 8 year old outcast living in the suburbs of Melbourne. On a whim, she chooses a name at random in a phone book and sends off a letter asking about life on the other side of the world. The letter is received by Max, an overweight depressive in his 40&apos;s living in New York, suffering from Aspergers Syndrome. A friendship is born as the pair exchange letters over the next 20 years. offering each other support, advice and the chance to see life through another set of eyes.

While the world is painted in gloomy hues of brown and grey and the characters lead bleak lives, the genius of the script is that the characters never wallow or feel sorry for themselves. The tone is kept humorous and balanced allowing us to be moved by the characters as they stumble through life but also laugh at their foibles and observations of the world they struggle to fit into. Not since Muriel&apos;s Wedding has Australia produced so fine a comedy with such rich detail and I probably got even more laughs out of this.

My only criticism of the film would be some of its music particularly its use in one key scene of the Humming Chorus (already used so memorably in the finale of Heavenly Creatures). It meant that in a critical moment I was thinking of Kate Winslet up to no good instead of connecting with Mary & Max. But this is more a personal concern and if that&apos;s the weakest thing about the film, it&apos;s doing pretty well. I hope this film is seen by the wide audience it so richly deserves.",8,"['Animation', 'Comedy', 'Drama']","['stop motion', 'unlikely friendship', 'friendship', 'black comedy', 'stop motion animation']",2010-03-12,['Adam Elliot'],"['Toni Collette', 'Philip Seymour Hoffman', 'Eric Bana']",['Adam Elliot']
How to Train Your Dragon,"A hapless young Viking who aspires to hunt dragons becomes the unlikely friend of a young dragon himself, and learns there may be more to the creatures than he assumed.","There are a lot of excellent reviews out there, I will just discuss a single point. What got to me the most in this movie is the message I got out of it, I got it from a single line uttered by the hero and it just burned in my memory, it&apos;s about how when we look deep in the eyes of our enemies -the ones we fear the most- we will see that they are afraid of us just as we are afraid of them, we might realize their humanity and that they are not what we thought, monsters.

This is definitely one of the best 2 animation movies this year, with Toy Story 3 being the other one, tough job for the academy awards this year, and hope this is the case every year.

Tôkyô monogatari,"An old couple visit their children and grandchildren in the city, but receive little attention.","Tokyo monogatari (or Tokyo Story) is a very human story. It contains a lot of everyday life which at times can make it difficult to follow since it may feel a little bit slow.

However who is patient gets rewarded. And Ozus way of telling this story is very quiet but effective. The images he produces and the very minimalist camera work creates a rhythm that sucks the viewer in and slowly opens him/her up for the sad but essential ending of this movie.

Ozu never tries to impose his story to the viewer. It looks like he follows his actors very disciplined and calm. This very structured and clear camera-work will alienate many modern moviegoers who are used to much more dynamic images. However lovers of purist cinema and fans of Aki Kaurismaki will probably love it.

La passion de Jeanne d&apos;Arc,"In 1431, Jeanne d&apos;Arc is placed on trial on charges of heresy.

Both showings were supported by a live organ play, which has been composed directly for the movie, and which suited perfectly. I had seen Nosferatu before, but i didn´t know anything about `Jeanne`, and so i was in no way prepared for this overwhelming, soul-rapturing experience.

My eyes were immediately glued to the screen. Unfortunately i had missed the first minutes, so it started for me with the first (?) court scene. The camera wandered through the faces of the court members, circled and focussed on Jeanne´s face. So beautiful, naked, strong and defenseless! I could rave on the technical perfection of this film, it´s clever editing, innovative and gorgeous cinematography, proper historical settings and pure storytelling. Carl Theodor Dreyer created a masterpiece. But the most outstanding feature of this silent are the performances; Maria Falconetti delivers simply the best performance of all times, and i can´t remember of any ´corny` overacting, which distracts most silent movies from the modern viewer, even the accepted classics. `La passion de Jeanne d´Arc´ is purest cinematic art, timeless in every sense.",10,"['Biography', 'Drama', 'History']","['trial', 'close up scene', 'teenage girl', 'restored film', 'breast feeding']",1928-10-25,['Carl Theodor Dreyer'],"['Maria Falconetti', 'Eugene Silvain', 'André Berley']","['Joseph Delteil', 'Carl Theodor Dreyer']"

This is particularly true for Ruffalo and McAdams. I adore the subtlety with which they both act. It is brilliant. There isn&apos;t much more to say.

Logan,"In a future where mutants are nearly extinct, an elderly and weary Logan leads a quiet life. But when Laura, a mutant child pursued by scientists, comes to him for help, he must get her to safety.","Gritty, honest and brutal. Just like a movie about Logan should be. This is by far the best X-Men film as far as I&apos;m concerned. Logan doesn&apos;t hold back at all which I absolutely loved. For the most part, there is just an onslaught of awful things happening. And apart from the relationship between Laura and Logan, nothing makes you go &apos;oh, that was nice&apos;.

Very early on in the film, I got huge John Wick vibes. The action was very reminiscent of those films. It was fast, it was brutal and graphic, and it wasn&apos;t afraid to show everything. Indeed, you got the sense that Mangold was trying to find more and more interesting and gory ways to kill people. Something that the John Wick franchise also does. This comparison between John Wick and Logan is nothing but a positive one. If you ask me, the John Wick films are some of the best action films to have come out in recent years, as is Logan.

Where Logan really shines though, is not in the action, but in the story of Logan. It&apos;s a depiction Logan that I think a lot of people have wanted to see. Although I&apos;m by no means an expert on the comic books, I have always had the feeling that Logan is a much more complex and difficult character than the previous X-Men or Wolverine films have led to believe. Logan is just as brutal with its depiction of the character as it is with its action.

Logan really should be used a case study on how to do a comic book film. The only problem it faces is its R rating. I absolutely loved the rating as it allowed the film to go as dark as it needed and wanted to go. But comic book movies are, of course, supposed to be the highest-grossing films studios make, and an R rating will automatically lower revenues.

If you have been looking for a comic book film that isn&apos;t just like all the previous ones, Logan is the one for you. As mentioned, it is brutally honest and gritty, and the action is more brutal than you would ever dare to expect. It&apos;s a fantastic action film but it also manages to create such an impressive story that you will find yourself amazed with the depth of it. Is it my favourite comic book movie ever? No. But is it easily one of the best ones?

Rush,The merciless 1970s rivalry between Formula One rivals James Hunt and Niki Lauda.,"Mr. Ron Howard is a great story teller, this movie is about human nature, love and tears.

It is difficult to make a good movie about car racing, especially to make one for the time period from 1970 to 1976. I don&apos;t know how they did it to bring those old F1 cars back to life. You will feel like you are really there watching the racing, it&apos;s really unbelievable.

It is truly touching to see each character played their perfect role for this movie, Chris Hemsworth did a great performance, he is such a talented and devoted actor. Daniel Brühl also did a great job on portraying the eccentric and unsociable legendary F1 driver Niki Lauda.

A great movie is like having a great meal, a good starter, a good soup/salad, a good main course and a good dessert, well balanced. Rush is that good meal, it&apos;s a fun ride!

I have to say I really enjoyed watching this movie. Thank you Mr. Ron Howard for making this masterpiece.",10,"['Action', 'Biography', 'Drama']","['formula 1', 'rivalry', '1970s', 'racecar driver', 'nurburgring germany']",2013-09-27,['Ron Howard'],"['Daniel Brühl', 'Chris Hemsworth', 'Olivia Wilde']",['Peter Morgan']
Network,"A television network cynically exploits a deranged former anchor&apos;s ravings and revelations about the news media for its own profit, but finds that his message may be difficult to control.","This is one of those wonderful films where everything comes together. The acting and the writing is by far the most impressive elements of this film. William Holden and Peter Finch should have both received Oscars for their performances, instead of just Peter Finch. Faye Dunaway pulls of the most dynamic and emotional characters she has ever played.

The true brilliance of this film is that all elements of it fade appropriately behind the actors and their messages. The film is completely a work of storytelling and, at least for the writer, stunning clarity of message and purpose. Political films come and go but few remain in the annals of film because of their effectiveness at their own message. 

The cinematography, editing, sound, costume design, art direction and production design are all quite simplistic. In some scenes the film can be accused of being almost ugly. However this all lends to the back-washing of the film so as to allow the message to ring loudest. In my opinion, Sidney Lumet took this just a little too far and thus I give it a 9 instead of a 10.

This is certainly a film for the history books. Every connoisseur of film should be exposed to this movie at some point in their life. If you happen to be cynical, then you will love every minute of this movie as its stark view of life in the 1970&apos;s (and onward) touches the hard of even the hardest of cynics. For those educators out there, GREAT film for classes on Media and Politics.",9,['Drama'],"['media', 'television', 'television network', 'tv news', 'ranting']",1976-11-27,['Sidney Lumet'],"['Faye Dunaway', 'William Holden', 'Peter Finch']",['Paddy Chayefsky']

The Wizard of Oz,"Young Dorothy Gale and her dog Toto are swept away by a tornado from their Kansas farm to the magical Land of Oz, and embark on a quest with three new friends to see the Wizard, who can return her to her home and fulfill the other...","I have a theory that this movie has probably been seen by more people than any other movie. The fact that it comes to us as children is probably the reason why. Other films like &apos;Gone With the Wind&apos;, &apos;Citizen Kane&apos;, &apos;The Godfather&apos;, &apos;Star Wars&apos;, have been seen by a lot of people but in each case I can imagine people that might not have seen them. In the case of &apos;The Wizard of Oz&apos; it&apos;s hard to imagine anyone who might not have seen it at some point in their lives. Almost everyone you talk to has a memory of their first experience. The reason this movie remains the most beloved of Hollywood films even after six decades is because &apos;The Wizard of Oz&apos; is unique among motion pictures in that it mirrors our longings and imaginations as children. 

The movie, in front of and behind the scenes, has become movie folklore. We love the legends about the rotating directors, from George Cukor to King Vidor to Victor Fleming. We know the legend of Buddy Ebsen who had to drop out due to an allergic reaction to the Tin Man makeup and Margaret Hamilton whose dress caught fire and nearly had her face burned off because of the copper-based make-up. We love stories about the problems on the set between personal feuds, sweltering costumes, partying munchkins and the costume designer who had to keep up with Judy Garland&apos;s developing bust line. There&apos;s even a spurious legend of a ghost on the set. All of these elements make &apos;The Wizard of Oz&apos; a much bigger legend than it already it, but that&apos;s okay because this is the one movie that deserves to be over-hyped. It occupies such a large part of our memories that we want to make it more than it is, to just have one more reason to make it more than a movie, we want it to be a life experience.

That experience is brought to us because we are intimately familiar with its story elements. The dreams that Dorothy sings about and the adventure that follows seem to mirror our yearnings as children. She imagines a bigger place where her problems don&apos;t linger and she is free to explore them. She imagines a place where there isn&apos;t any trouble and people actually listen to what she has to say. She sees the rainbow as her golden gate to a better place because in her drab Kansas world, the rainbow is the only source of color that she knows. She dreams of a bigger place and imagines a world where troubles melt like lemondrops. We can relate. How many of us as kids sat in our room or in our yards and played, imagining a place to go and characters to interact with, a colorful world bigger than our small, confined worlds. 

Oz is meant to represent the colorful palette of our imagination but for Dorothy it is also a place where she does some growing up. The three friends that she meets along the way, The Scarecrow, The Tin Man and The Lion are emblematic of the lessons of bravery, love and devotion and the ability to think for ourselves. The Wicked Witch of the West certainly represents the real dangers along the way. For Dorothy there is a matronly figure, Glinda the Good Witch who intends for Dorothy to discover for herself how to solve her problems, she knows that Dorothy must grow up along the way. In a way, she seems to represent the parent that Dorothy doesn&apos;t have back in Kansas. Her aunt and uncle love her but this was a movie made during the depression and we imagine the climate that they live in, where work means keeping the farm. No work = no farm = no home.

For 1939, Dorothy was the perfect character for young girls. She echoes many of the small town country girls who, in the midst of the depression, packed their suitcases and ran to Hollywood seeking fame and fortune in the movies. For them this film is a cautionary tale that they&apos;d be better off if they just stayed home. Judy Garland was perfect in the role, 17 at the time, but with wide-eyes and a beautiful, open face she carries that sense of wonderment of a child. Like most of us as children, her only true companion is a dog named Toto and the most frightening moment in the film is when she is nearly robbed of her best friend. When she sings &apos;Over the Rainbow&apos; we know that it&apos;s to escape an unhappy childhood (she has apparently lost her parents) and for Garland we identify. She began in show business as a kiddie act with her sisters and began her long movie career when she was only 13. She was already a familiar face from &apos;Love Finds Andy Hardy&apos; and by the time of &apos;Oz&apos; she was already under contract to MGM. That she was familiar to audiences helped her in the role. That familiarity works well with her ability to project the vulnerability and melancholy that the character has to have. We have to believe that she will become frightened and that her life will be in danger because if she doesn&apos;t that we sense that the character can work her way out of the situation herself and our interest wanes.

If movies are a time capsule than &apos;The Wizard of Oz&apos; wonderfully captures a brief moment of happiness in Garland&apos;s life. We know of her problems with studio execs that put her through an exhausting schedule and used drugs to get her going in the morning then put her to sleep at night. We know the legends of her mental and physical problems that dogged her most of her life but &apos;The Wizard of Oz&apos; sees her at a moment in her life when it all seemed perfect, just as her star was rising and before her problems really began. There&apos;s poignancy in that, and that&apos;s why I think that the casting of Shirley Temple in the role would have been a mistake. By 1939, Temple was the biggest star in the world her presence in the film would have been too much, she would have stood out and we would only seen Shirley Temple, not Dorothy Gale.

Garland&apos;s presence allows the story a certain credibility. I have tried to imagine that famous dance down the Yellow Brick Road with a 4 foot child and it just doesn&apos;t fit.

If Garland gives the film its center than I think the production design, awe-inspiring in 1939, is the perfect backdrop. In these early musicals filmed on a soundstage it isn&apos;t hard to spot where the soundstage ends. Some have seen that as a flaw but I think it adds to the dreamlike quality of the film. The matte paintings behind the sets add to the storybook quality. The fact that we&apos;re in a dream makes it okay that the special effects look a little hasty. That was the genius of the screenplay, that and to establish the Oz characters as characters that Dorothy meets in Kansas. In our dreams we often see people and events that have recently occurred in our lives, but this is the first time I&apos;ve ever seen it expressed in a movie. In particular is the notion that Professor Marvel keeps showing up as various characters in the dream.

What generosity the filmmakers had. What ingenuity to create this entire world that is colorful and beautiful and scary. What depth of character they created. What messages they send. This is a movie constructed with loving care. We&apos;re told that those who worked on the film just thought of this as just another movie, but when I watch the film I find that hard to believe. Certainly from the screenwriters. I wonder if they saw how brilliantly they were tapping our frustrations and our excitement, our dreams, our need and our sense of wonderment. I wonder if they knew the impact of what they were working on, that the lovely sentiments that they created would still resonate 60 years later. I wonder if they knew that their heart&apos;s desires weren&apos;t that far from our own.",,"['Adventure', 'Family', 'Fantasy']","['witch', 'wizard of oz', 'tornado', 'evil witch', 'wizard']",1939-08-25,"['Victor Fleming', 'George Cukor', 'Mervyn LeRoy']","['Judy Garland', 'Frank Morgan', 'Ray Bolger']","['Noel Langley', 'Florence Ryerson', 'Edgar Allan Woolf']"

Those few characters&apos; state of mind and their relationship dynamics at that point in time, was conveyed with such explosive intensity, I got gut punched drunk.

 Pather Panchali boasts of suitably melodramatic yet highly intuitive performances. Its breath taking cinematography ranks alongside existential beauty this side of Malick heaven. The musical scoring, by the great Ravi Shankar, is identifiably Indian, yet universally sublime. Together, these myriad parts melded into a whole so grand in its social consciousness, so incisively intimate in its portrait of one family, I could do nothing but be slowly devoured like a most willing prey. 

On 4th Oct 2003, I saw my all time favourite film, Tokyo Story. The feeling I got today from Pather Panchali, is as close as is possible from that fateful October day.

The visuals and sound are very impressive, but it&apos;s the story that carries this film: a solid combination of humor, drama, suspense, family ties and action.

I confess the sin of prejudice concerning Mexican cinema, this being maybe the second Mexican film I have ever seen, but here my sins are punished. This is the work of a director of big talent. Hopefully, he will not be spoiled by the success.

 Three different stories in today&apos;s Mexico mix with very few common elements. The characters belong to different social categories, and nothing connects them at first sight, excepting the feeling of un-happiness, and - yes - dogs. Dogs play an important role in all three stories. One more warning - there is a lot of cruelty including dog fights - this film is certainly not for sensitive animal lovers. 

Directing is excellent, the stories are human and complex and despite their melodramatic or sometimes tragic outcome, they still leave you with a shade of hope - maybe because the humanity that the author uses to create his characters. There are so many memorable scenes, that I would commit another sin to pick any and describe it here - just rent, or go to watch this movie in the theater - it is worth all 150 or so minutes you will spend. 9/10 on my personal scale.",9,"['Drama', 'Thriller']","['multiple perspectives', 'mexico city', 'nonlinear timeline', 'interlinked stories', 'dog fight']",2001-04-13,['Alejandro G.

Ah-ga-ssi,"A woman is hired as a handmaiden to a Japanese heiress, but secretly she is involved in a plot to defraud her.","I knew nothing about this film coming into it, other that it being very well considered, and that it has some strong sexual content. This is probably the best way to watch it, as I did not know where the plot was going to start or go. Essentially a con man plans to seduce, marry, and abandon a wealthy unmarried woman – taking her from her uncle and then taking her money. To do this he employs the services of a young pickpocket to work as her handmaiden, and help work the plan from the inside, so to speak.

What the film does with this basic plot is enjoyable and engaging. The narrative is solid, holds the interest without effort, and is very well paced and structured. I wonder would it work as well if I had known the source material, or had more knowledge of the wider plot. As a con, the plot is solidly enjoyable and avoids the silly flamboyance of some films where such a plot would be allowed to turn into a &apos;caper&apos;. Within the plot are some surprisingly sexual elements, and these sit across the sweet, the sensual, and the dark. There is also a good amount of humor where it matters – in particular in part 1 of the film, this is used well in relation to the main character.

The direction, production values, and general pacing of the film, all work together to give it a beautiful appearance and tone. It is quite sensuous to watch, with such great colors, sets, costumes, and designs. Within this the actors are all strong. Min-hee Kim and Tae- ri Kim in particular are engaging, although the downside of me being into their characters/performances was that it made the heavy nudity in some of their extended scenes feel a bit exploitative in nature. Jung-woo Ha is solid throughout, and Jin-woong Jo is just the right level of monster for the plot to work.

Les quatre cents coups,"A young boy, left without attention, delves into a life of petty crime.","Les quatre-cents coups is the film that opens up the New Wave movement. I think many of the characteristics of the New Wave -as pointed out in class- can be inferred form the differences between the last film we saw in class, Carné&apos;s Les enfants du paradis, and this work by Truffaut: real life situations, no sets, everyday people. I have found in Les quatre-cents coups a brand new, refreshing and overwhelming cinema. But Les quatre-cents coups is also a dense, complicated film. Its autobiographical character makes it an encyclopedia of personal feelings, opinions and nuances of an introspection by Truffaut.

Technically, the main differences between Truffaut and the previous cinema is the use of camera movements and angles. Although Renoir had made a witty and fresh use of traveling and long takes, Truffaut masters this technique as anyone else does. The camera moves smoothly, it nearly swings or floats from angle to angle following an action, as if the spectator was a ghost amid real life. Truffaut enjoys playing around with the camera: extremely long takes as we have never seen in any of the previous films: some of them in the classroom, other in Antoine&apos;s friend house, or a magnificent take at the end of the film in which we see Antoine, then a panoramic view and then Antoine again, running towards the sea. He also shoots from impossible angles, like those at the beginning from below the Tour Eiffel, or the nearly zenithal take following the jogging students in the streets. Or he teases us with the fake black out, when Antoine goes down the stairs to throw away garbage. Or shows us inner feelings through close-ups: the scene in which Antoine lies to his father telling him he did not take his map.

However, I think that the most important difference between previous films and this one is the treatment of action. Truffaut is an observer, a photographer of soul. He takes a fiendish delight in shooting casual, long scenes: the boy tearing away his notebook pages; the whole sequence of Antoine&apos;s arrival at his empty home is excellent: the three reflexes in his mother&apos;s mirror -in which she will look afterwards, or Antoine combing his hair, laying the table. Also the spinning ride, or the long traveling following the escape of Antoine. They are long, but not slow. They keep tension up, as if everyday acts and decisions could be heroic and transmit the greatest interest and attraction. It looks like a documentary on human life! Some comments could be made about Antoine Doinel, alter ego of Truffaut. He is a very complicated character. The most curious thing about him is that he behaves like an adult: he acts, walks and talks like a man -especially if we compare him to his teachers or his father! However, at some times I think Truffaut describes himself as being not too witty: remember the candle in the hole on the wall, or how his friend convinces him to steal the typewriter and then makes him give it back, or how he innocently copies a whole paragraph from Balzac. He wants to be an artist, but he is not -not yet. This lack of wit and fatality -he is caught but everyone around him cheats as he does- leads him to a rebellion that grows stronger and stronger. This explain why he is such a rebel and not his friend, or the other children in the class, who live in the same social group.

The main topic in Les quatre-cents coups is the quest for freedom, but not in the way Renoir looked at it, in fact is closer to L&apos;Atalante by Vigo than to Renoir&apos;s La grande illusion, for example. Renoir is more concerned by social struggle and the liberty of the people. But Truffaut is more introspective, more intimate: indeed this film is the description of life attitude of an independent spirit through the autobiographical look of the author -this is cinéma d&apos;auteur. We can find many elements from Truffaut&apos;s life in the film: a difficult family situation, problems at school, the Army, etc. These elements will appear throughout the film. Antoine, alter ego of Truffaut lives in the school, in his house, in the streets and finally in the juvenile detention center. In each one of these places he will find adverse situations he will have to overcome.

The school The school is the first oppressing environment for Antoine. At the very beginning he is caught, by chance, with a pin-up calendar. This fatality will be recalled in Antoine&apos;s life later or -when he is caught by the porter giving the typewriter back, having been his friend&apos;s idea to steal it. He is a rebel, and nothing will refrain him from being so. He is punished, and he misbehaves again, writing in the wall an inspired poem. The school is the only place in which Truffaut makes a little bit of criticism, in this case against the education system: the three teachers are either cruel (the French teacher) or stupid (the English and Physical Education teachers).

The house The house situation might be similar to that lived by Truffaut in real life. Her mother, a beautiful, egocentric and unscrupulous woman -sometimes sad, and old looking- who hates him. At the end of the film we discover that she did not want that child. This hatred and the attitude of his father -a smiley and cheerful but weak man- will add to the necessity of Antoine to flee. Truffaut gives us a Freudian wink: when his teacher asks him why he missed school, Antoine will sharply answer: &apos;My mom died!&apos;

The streets In the streets Antoine will find freedom, challenge, adulthood but also perversion: he becomes a man in a 13-year old boy body, little by little. But he will also become a criminal; together with his friend they will climb up in the scale of crime. He first skips classes. He and his friend stroll around the city, innocently. Then they begin an adult, abnormally rebel behavior: they make cars stop in the middle of the street, for example. The spinning ride is one of the few symbolic images in the film -that is another difference with Vigo and Renoir filmmaking. The scene of Antoine trying without success to fight against centrifuge force in a mad spinning trip really shocked me: he fights against reality and he is suffering, but he also has fun in it. Afterwards, he leaves home. . He will learn about solitude and indeed not a single word is heard in a long sequence. I really enjoyed the long, silent scene of the milk robbery. Antoine runs outlaw like an animal, we can feel loneliness, cold, hunger, sleepiness. It is another of those long, slow but at the same time agile scenes about casual acts: drinking a bottle of milk. At the end, the streets will make him a criminal. From the moment he is caught on, he is not treated as a child anymore. He wants to be an adult, and a spell will sort of be cast on him: he will be treated as such. It is significant when he is caught by the porter. He is told not to take off the hat, which made him look like an adult. From then on, he is treated roughly as if he was a man, especially in the police station.

The prison And finally he arrives at the prison, which I think is the climax of oppression -we must remember the comparisons to the Army Truffaut detests. It is maybe the simplest of the scenarios, he find himself facing what he hates with no other possibility. The ending is a sublime anticlimax. After being punished for eating the bread, Antoine goes on &apos;normal&apos; life within the detention center: he visits the psychologist -an ultimate introspection by Truffaut-, receives his mother and talk to his new friends and plays soccer. And suddenly, when we least expect it, he flees. He runs, runs, runs, the longest run I have ever seen, and the most exciting. He reaches the sea: his dream, and a symbol for eternity and absolute in poetry. He splashes into the water, he stops and looks back; the first time he looks right into the camera. This has got undoubtedly a deep and very personal meaning that maybe only the author knows. It is a pessimistic or an optimistic ending? I think it is above all an out-of-this-world ending. If the simple presence of the sea, Antoine&apos;s object of liberty, is overwhelming for the spectator, how should the character feel? I really liked the final traveling: we follow Antoine&apos;s run over the sand, but the camera is facing the inland, we are waiting to see the sea as much as Antoine is waiting to wet his feet. I do not really think that he is deceived, although his look into the camera is ambiguous. I think he stares at the spectator because he has realized what the truth is: the character is now out of the film. And the truth for him, I think, is this: I can reach freedom whenever I want, but absolute freedom is impossible to achieve. He is staring at us, but he is also looking back with a grave look: he might have seen his pursuer in the distance.",,"['Crime', 'Drama']","['coming of age', 'skipping school', 'mother son relationship', 'juvenile delinquent', 'french new wave']",1959-11-16,['François Truffaut'],"['Jean-Pierre Léaud', 'Albert Rémy', 'Claire Maurier']","['François Truffaut', 'Marcel Moussy']"

It Happened One Night,"A renegade reporter trailing a young runaway heiress for a big story joins her on a bus heading from Florida to New York, and they end up stuck with each other when the bus leaves them behind at one of the stops.","Many things don&apos;t mix or go together, quite often they repel but when things do gel, when they seamlessly merge and mingle like two dancers combined as one, the end result can often be quite memorable, magical and spectacular. As here, with Claudette Colbert and Clark Gable, where the story is pretty immaterial but the interactions between the pair makes this, to this day, as engaging, charming and funny a conjuring as any you might previously have come across and, quite probably, any you might venture to find in the future.",8,"['Comedy', 'Romance']","['bus', 'reporter', 'spoiled brat', 'haystack', 'journalism']",1934-02-22,['Frank Capra'],"['Clark Gable', 'Claudette Colbert', 'Walter Connolly']","['Robert Riskin', 'Samuel Hopkins Adams']"
Persona,A nurse is put in charge of a mute actress and finds that their personae are melding together.,"PERSONA may well be Ingmar Bergman&apos;s most complex film--yet, like many Bergman films, the story it tells is superficially simple. Actress Elizabeth Volger has suddenly stopped speaking in what appears to be an effort to cease all communication with the external world. She is taken to a hospital, where nurse Alma is assigned to care for her. After some time, Elisabeth&apos;s doctor feels the hospital is of little use to her; the doctor accordingly lends her seaside home to Elisabeth, who goes there with Alma in attendance. Although Elisabeth remains silent, the relationship between the women is a pleasant one--until a rainy day, too much alcohol, and Elisabeth&apos;s silence drives Alma into a series of highly charged personal revelations.

It is at this point that the film, which has already be super-saturated with complex visual imagery, begins to create an unnerving and deeply existential portrait of how we interpret others, how others interpret us, and the impact that these interpretations have upon both us and them. What at first seemed fond glances and friendly gestures from the silent Elisabeth are now suddenly open to different interpretations, and Alma--feeling increasingly trapped by the silence--enters into a series of confrontations with her patient... but these confrontations have a dreamlike quality, and it becomes impossible to know if they are real or imagined--and if imagined, in which of the women&apos;s minds the fantasy occurs.

Ultimately, Bergman seems to be creating a situation in which we are forced to acknowledge that a great deal of what we believe we know about others rests largely upon what we ourselves project upon them. Elisabeth&apos;s face and its expressions become akin to a blank screen on which we see our own hopes, dreams, torments, and tragedies projected--while the person behind the face constantly eludes our understanding. In this respect, the theme is remarkably well-suited to its medium: the blankness of the cinema screen with its flickering, endless shifting images that can be interpreted in infinite ways.

Bergman is exceptionally fortunate in his actresses here: both Liv Ullman as the silent Elisabeth and Bibi Anderson as the increasingly distraught Alma offer incredible performances that seem to encompass both what we know from the obvious surface and what we can never know that exists behind their individual masks. Ullman has been justly praised for the power of her silence in this film, and it is difficult to imagine another actress who could carry off a role that must be performed entirely by ambiguous implications. Anderson is likewise remarkable, her increasing levels of emotional distress resounding like the waves upon the rocks at their seaside retreat. And Bergman and his celebrated cinematographer Sven Nykvist fill the screen with a dreamlike quality that is constantly interrupted by unexpected images ranging from glimpses of silent films to a moment at which the celluloid appears to burn to images that merge Ullman and Anderson&apos;s faces into one.

As in many of his films, Bergman seems to be stating that we cannot know another person, and that our inability to do is our greatest tragedy. But however the film is interpreted, it is a stunning and powerful achievement, one that will resonate with the viewer long after the film ends.

The Iron Giant,,"The Iron Giant is a critically acclaimed piece of animated cinema. I wasn&apos;t expecting it to be that good, but The Iron Giant was an amazing movie, it is easily the most exquisite animated movie I have ever seen.

Hogarth Hughes (Eli Marenthal) is obsessed by the opportunites offered by science fiction, the possibility of an alien take-over or, at the very least, an attack from outer space. The original story, which the late Poet Laureate had set in England, saw the innocent Titan of the title emerge from the sea; here he is a visitor from another galaxy.

The Iron Giant is an amazing piece of animation, the voice-overs were done perfectly, the actors obviously enjoyed themselves, the animated art direction and cinematography was beautiful and the giant itself is just...breathtaking.

The Iron Giant is not just another silly little kiddies movie, it is perfection in filmmaking. Please, for the love of God, make your life better and see this brilliant film.

I rate The Iron Giant 10 out of 10.",,"['Animation', 'Action', 'Adventure']","['giant robot', '1950s', 'government agent', 'friendship', 'small town']",1999-08-06,['Brad Bird'],"['Eli Marienthal', 'Harry Connick Jr.', 'Jennifer Aniston']","['Tim McCanlies', 'Brad Bird', 'Ted Hughes']"
Dersu Uzala,The Russian army sends an explorer on an expedition to the snowy Siberian wilderness where he makes friends with a seasoned local hunter.,"On the face of it, Dersu Uzala would not seem like a candidate for a great film. The story is about a young Russian (Imperial Russia) officer is sent to the far east of Siberia to explore. He meets with a native of the region and they form a bond together. The territory in question is the wild, rugged eastern Siberia (north of Valdivostok). I would say that you have not lived until you have seen what Kurosawa can do filming nature in its raw splendor and magnificence. The scenes in this film like the wind rushing through the tall reeds, or the mist draping the forested hills, are images of haunting beauty.

Kurosawa, one of the greatest film directors of the 20th century, made his final masterpiece with film. The characters are well drawn, the sub-text of the story (the clash of civilization vs. nature) is nuanced, but most of all it is the wild beauty of nature which is the focus of this film. Once you see it, I don&apos;t think you will forget it, I know I never have.",9,"['Adventure', 'Biography', 'Drama']","['explorer', 'forest', 'wilderness', 'wilderness survival', 'siberia russia']",1977-12-20,['Akira Kurosawa'],"['Maksim Munzuk', 'Yuriy Solomin', 'Mikhail Bychkov']","['Akira Kurosawa', 'Yuriy Nagibin', 'Vladimir Arsenev']"
Aladdin,A kind-hearted street urchin and a power-hungry Grand Vizier vie for a magic lamp that has the power to make their deepest wishes come true.,"I know everyone wants to compare this to the Animated version, but don&apos;t. Take it as it comes and you will thoroughly enjoy it. It does stay pretty faithful to the animated version I think. Will Smith as the genie could never be the Robyn Williams genie, but I don&apos;t think he tries to. He does fantastically well in his own right. Absolutely loved the Prince Ali song where Aladdin enters the city as the prince. Brilliantly colorful spectacle captured really well. Jafar missed a little for me as had lost the smarmy-ness of the animated version. The songs were great and the Aladdin and Jasmine characterization was pretty spot on. I think kids would love this and I would definitely recommend it.",8,"['Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Family']","['flying carpet', 'monkey', 'tiger', 'parrot', 'princess']",2019-05-24,['Guy Ritchie'],"['Will Smith', 'Mena Massoud', 'Naomi Scott']","['John August', 'Guy Ritchie']"
