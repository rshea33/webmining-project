100 Feet,"After Marnie Watson kills her abusive husband in self-defense, she is condemned to house arrest... only to discover that the house is possessed by the enraged and violent spirit of her dead husband.","The story starts with an interesting premise but soon goes overboard in depicting some gory scenes of a ghost&apos;s vengeance during which time much blood is shed for the sake of horror fans who like this sort of thing. It&apos;s well acted and tense with some quietly underplayed opening scenes, but once the ghost starts wreaking the place all hell breaks loose and the story loses a great deal of credibility.

The acting is fine, with Famke Janssen giving a strong performance as a woman forced to wear an ankle bracelet and kept under close watch by a suspicious policeman who was her husband&apos;s partner. But the tension doesn&apos;t become tight until the last third of the story and then it goes way over the top in depicting violence.

Scary enough but midway through, the story loses a lot of credibility despite the high quality of the performances.",6,"['Horror', 'Mystery', 'Thriller']","['prison', 'house arrest', 'revenge', 'ankle bracelet', 'abusive husband']",2008-07-24,['Eric Red'],"['Famke Janssen', 'Bobby Cannavale', 'Ed Westwick']",['Eric Red']

Thirteen Conversations About One Thing,"In New York City, the lives of a lawyer, an actuary, a house-cleaner, a professor and the people around them intersect as they ponder order and happiness in the face of life&apos;s cold unpredictability.","In `13 Conversations About One Thing,&apos; the `one thing&apos; that everyone keeps having conversations about is whether or not happiness is possible in a world that seems to be made up of little more than a series of random events haphazardly strung together. Just as everything seems to be going your way, an unexpected and unforeseen `event&apos; may knock you completely off course, thereby depriving you of that `happiness&apos; you felt, moments before, lay just within your grasp. This view of life seems to be rather popular among filmmakers this year, having also been explored in some depth in the sci-fi thriller `Signs&apos; this summer. `13 Conversations&apos; takes a more low-keyed approach, providing a series of interlocking vignettes from everyday life that, when pieced together, provide a possible answer to life&apos;s ultimate question. 

Writers Karen and Jill Sprecher (the latter also directed the film) have fashioned a complex narrative involving a number of characters whose paths cross in bizarre and often shocking ways. In fact, the film is rather unique in that the structure actually BECOMES the theme, as we discover that events that seem random to us - and indeed to the characters - at the outset actually come together to form a meaningful pattern. As one character says at the end of the film, life really only makes sense when we take the time to look back on it, for it is only from that perspective that we are able to discern the overarching pattern and meaning of it all.

All of the many characters in the film are struggling not only to define happiness but to attain a measure of it for themselves in a world in which they are made to feel like mere helpless pawns, blown about by the whims of `fortune,&apos; `luck,&apos; `chance,&apos; `fate,&apos; whatever one wants to call the `power&apos; that seems to determine the courses our lives end up taking. Matthew McConaughey plays a handsome and successful public defender who feels that he has achieved happiness in his career only to have it ripped from him when he runs over a young woman at a corner and leaves the scene of the crime. The woman herself (Clea Duvall), before the accident, is a sincere believer in a higher power that watches over us and guides us along the path it most wants us to take. Yet, after the accident, she loses that belief, coming instead to see life as a chaotic jumble of chance circumstances, devoid of meaning and purpose. John Turturro plays a college professor suffering from the classic symptoms of major midlife crisis. He abandons his wife (Amy Irving), conducts a meaningless affair with a coworker, and finds no relevance or fulfillment in his teaching job or in the students he could be guiding and helping. As a Physics teacher, he knows that the universe is NOT random, that it does, in fact, operate within a series of finely proscribed natural laws. Perhaps this is why he is the one character who actually tries to buck `fate&apos; and to take proactive measures to change the course of his life. The problem is that the course change brings him no more satisfaction than did his previous life path. Perhaps, most fascinating of all is Alan Arkin, a businessman so unhappy with his own life that he takes pleasure in ruining the life of a co-worker who seems somehow to have attained the happiness that has eluded the rest of us.

`13 Conversations About One Thing&apos; is definitely a movie that grows on you. Like `Go&apos; a few years back, the makers of this film respect the intelligence of their audience. They gather the strands of their story slowly, thereby allowing us to make connections and to eventually come up with the theme on our own. As the film&apos;s director, Jill Sprecher never hurries us along. In fact, much of the profundity of the screenplay is brought out by the elegiac, lyrical tone she establishes throughout. The quiet, unhurried pacing of the scenes puts the audience into a reflective state of mind that helps us see beneath the deceptively simple surface of the film&apos;s action.

McConaughey, Duvall, Turturro and Irving are all outstanding in this film, but it is Arkin who soars in the key role of the disgruntled businessman. His sad-faced, understated portrayal of a man so caught up in petty bitterness that he will willfully destroy a harmless fellow human being to make himself feel a bit less miserable is shattering in its brilliance. He has truly never been better. Ditto for the other actors, for this is a great ensemble cast, even though most of the performers never appear in any scenes together.

`13 Conversations About One Thing&apos; is a film that feels like it has REALLY BEEN THOUGHT OUT ahead of time, not thrown together in haphazard fashion as so many other films appear to be. And that, given the theme of the film, is exactly the point.",,['Drama'],"['happiness', 'professor', 'house cleaner', 'attorney', 'new york city']",2002-07-05,['Jill Sprecher'],"['Alan Arkin', 'John Turturro', 'Matthew McConaughey']","['Karen Sprecher', 'Jill Sprecher']"

1990: I guerrieri del Bronx,"In a post-apocalyptic New York City, a policeman infiltrates the Bronx, which has become a battleground for several murderous street gangs.","I have watched the sequel to this film before, but this is the first time seeing this one and I have to say it is a better film. Basically, it is kind of a combination of Warriors and Escape From New York brought to us by Italy who likes to take something that is popular here and make it their own. Usually the film is not the best film ever made, but it can oftentimes turn out to be rather entertaining and that is the case with this one. It has some good action and a so over the top plot that it is at times rather funny too.

The story, Trash and his gang find a girl being harassed by a gang on roller skates called the Zombies! Why they are called the Zombies and not the Wheelies is anybody&apos;s guess. This girl is actually supposed to be the head of some major weapons company, which is honestly rather stupid and just a strange excuse to bring in the Hammer! Vic Morrow plays the bad guy and does so with his usual gusto making the film more entertaining than it should be. Trash must find the Ogre who is king of Bronx, but there is much treachery afoot and the flamethrowers are a coming!

Fred Williamson plays the Ogre and the amount of times he appears in films in Italy leads me to believe the man really enjoy the country. I heard he once asked to be in a film, the one with the guy and a talking motorcycle and they agreed to put him in it. I am betting he was going to have to go home otherwise! Vic Morrow also appears in a lot of these Italian films too and I bet the same applies to him.

So, this film has lots of mindless violence and lots of weird stuff going on and so it is not a good film, but fun to watch nonetheless. It is kind of like a Full Moon film with these Italian films that copy the famous films, they are usually short and may not be great, but always generally fun and once in a while you get a diamond in the rough. This one manages to entertain and also can make you laugh and make you wonder. Like, why didn&apos;t Vic Morrow simply move out of the way of the harpoon as he had all day to do so.",5,"['Action', 'Sci-Fi', 'Thriller']","['street gang', 'gang leader', 'new york city', 'urban decay', 'social decay']",1983-04-22,['Enzo G.

The 40 Year Old Virgin,,"Steve Carell has made a career out of portraying the slightly odd straight guy, first on &apos;The Daily Show&apos;, and then in various supporting roles. In Virgin, Carell has found a clever and hilarious script that perfectly capitalizes on his strengths. Carell plays Andy Stitzer, a middle aged man living a quiet, lonely life. Andy is a little odd, but in an awkward nice guy sort of way. One night, while socializing with his co-workers for the first time, Andy accidentally reveals that he is a virgin. His co-workers, David (Paul Rudd), Jay (Romany Malco), and Cal (Seth Rogen) initially tease Andy about his situation. But it&apos;s clear that all three have a certain respect for the decent human being that Andy is, and they resolve to help him out by assisting him in ending his virginity. And so begins Andy&apos;s quest into adulthood. Andy is the quintessential innocent, and the bulk of the humor derives from his naiveté to the situations he finds himself in throughout the film. Some of the humor is crude gross out stuff, but most of it is just well done intelligent comedy. In addition, I found some parts of the film actually pretty touching as Andy finds himself developing both romantic relationships and friendships perhaps for the first time in his life. I&apos;m not trying to portray the movie as a love story or a drama; it&apos;s a rolling in your seats comedy. Still, every good comedy I have ever seen contains enough heart for you to care about the characters. A good comparison would be &apos;The Wedding Crashers&apos; from earlier this summer. Virgin has a similar humor, but is perhaps a bit more vulgar in some of its jokes. I particularly loved the ending of the film, which I thought was a perfect way to end the flick. Without giving anything away, it reminded me of &apos;Something About Mary&apos;. Very light and fun; it leaves you laughing and smiling, which is exactly how you should feel when you finish a comedy. I would highly recommend.",8,"['Comedy', 'Romance']","['40 year old', 'loss of virginity', 'male virgin', 'single mother', 'porn star']",2005-08-19,['Judd Apatow'],"['Steve Carell', 'Catherine Keener', 'Paul Rudd']","['Judd Apatow', 'Steve Carell']"
"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea","A ship sent to investigate a wave of mysterious sinkings encounters the advanced submarine, the Nautilus, commanded by Captain Nemo.","There&apos;s something out there roaming the Pacific Ocean destroying a whole lot of shipping and killing a lot of people. The more maritime the nation, the more losses it&apos;s suffering. Jules Verne&apos;s story has the United States of America taking the first crack at finding what&apos;s going on in the Pacific.

On a ship commanded by Ted DeCorsia are two Frenchmen, renowned scientist Paul Lukas and his assistant Peter Lorre. Also along is Kirk Douglas who is crack whaling harpooner. 

Of course they meet up with the beast and it&apos;s no living thing, but a submarine. This was all new back then, although prototype submarines were used in the Civil War they had limited effectiveness. In fact this particular kind of submarine was something unheard of until the middle of the last century. It&apos;s captain is a misanthropic fellow named Nemo, played by James Mason. He&apos;s taking it out on the nation&apos;s of the world for some personal losses sustained. 

His brilliance as a scientist, his refinement also attracts Paul Lukas. But Kirk Douglas just wants to escape because for all of Douglas&apos;s carefree philistinism, he sees Nemo as a murderer and a menace. The conflict between both is what drives the story.

20,000 Leagues Under the Sea won Oscars for both Special Effects and Art direction. It is probably Walt Disney&apos;s most successful live action film ever done, even beating out Mary Poppins dare I say. Even in this day of computer generated effects, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea still holds its own with more modern films.

Kirk Douglas enjoyed the part of Ned Land the harpooner and it&apos;s a favorite of his today. He might have made a few more films for Walt Disney but for an incident that took place after the film. 

Disney was also at the same time creating his first theme park, Disneyland in Anahem, California. When it was opening he invited Kirk and his family to spend the day there on him and he even agreed to furnish a camera crew to follow the Douglas family around as they enjoyed the park attractions. 

So Kirk took his wife and his sons and they had a grand old time and got some free home movies as a souvenir. But Walt Disney kept the negative and the films showed up on his Walt Disney Presents television show. Of course Kirk never got paid for this appearance and neither did any of the rest of his family including young Michael Douglas. 

Even though this left a sour taste in Kirk Douglas&apos;s mouth as he related in his memoirs, The Ragman&apos;s Son, he liked his work in this film very much and the part certainly has the same kind of exuberance we expect from a Kirk Douglas movie. Kirk even gets to sing in the film, a nice little sea chantey called A Whale of a Tale. He even made a record of it and I&apos;m sure if you can find it, the item might be worth a few dollars as a collectible.

Right around the time 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea was released the United States Navy launched it&apos;s first atomic submarine. In tribute to that most popular of French authors with American audiences, the Navy named the ship the Nautilus. A great tribute to a great writer of fabulous tales of imagination. And Walt Disney couldn&apos;t have gotten better publicity had he paid for it.

If you&apos;re looking for a comedic masterpiece this isn&apos;t it. If you&apos;re looking for something hardcore this isn&apos;t it.

That being said if you are looking for an example of the fine art of European erotic comedy from the the early - mid 1970&apos;s this is it.

I see many people complain about the quality please understand it was made in 1974. Yes the women do not conform to the modern ideal of attractiveness. They are by no means ugly women but they do not have the same looks which are idealized in our silicone culture. Yes the dubbing is not great but they are speaking German and anyone who speaks any German will realize it is pretty hard to dub over a word with 12 syllables.

If you have seen the DVD prior to the latest release it is marketed with 2 covers of 80&apos;s and recently 90&apos;s adult stars. The film is an R film so those complaining about hardcore should have realized this, the film is edited from the original BUT it was also edited prior to its run in the drive-ins in the late 1970s.

I first saw this film as a young man and judging by some comments there are many in the same boat who caught a glimpse on Cinemax. Many people become upset when later in life it doesn&apos;t live up to their previous memories. It&apos;s understandable considering the raunch and nudity packed into todays erotica.

If you compare 2069 to a modern soft-core erotic comedy you may be disappointed. The film while outlandish is actually quite fluid and the jokes while generally innuendos and double meanings still hold up and can still garner a chuckle. If you compare it to a hardcore movie you will be further disappointed, compared to today you see very little.

It is still one of the best examples along with Bottoms Up and The Other Cinderella of European Erotic/Comedic Cinema of the 1970&apos;s.",7,"['Comedy', 'Sci-Fi']","['exploitation', 'hot', 'erotic sci fi', 'humanoid alien', 'sex with alien woman']",,['Georg Tressler'],"['Nina Frederik', 'Catharina Conti', 'Heidrun Hankammer']",['Willy Pribil']

25th Hour,"Cornered by the DEA, convicted New York drug dealer Montgomery Brogan reevaluates his life in the 24 remaining hours before facing a seven-year jail term.","This great picture by the greatly discussed Spike Lee is one of a kind. What really makes this shine through the constant rubble being made by either incompetent directors or inexperienced ones is first of all, the incredible acting and for that you need great characters that are well thought-out and second comes the frighteningly real and tragic story. Which Lee handles with utmost care and outstanding precision.

Lee&apos;s trademarks are present here and the cinematography suits the feel of the movie very well. The final product feels very polished, but true to the story and it is those small things that some of us notice, those details that separate a veteran from a novice. There are some weak points, but they are only minor.

The acting here is top notch. Norton convinces once again and makes for a great heartfelt performance and Hoffman is equally impressive. However, I was completely blown away by Pepper. Barry Pepper. He &apos;was&apos; continuously Frank and very consistent in his acting. The scene where he breaks down and Norton thanks him in a way for what he has done is one of the most beautiful scenes I have ever seen. It felt so authentic.

Furthermore, I can keep writing about how great this movie is or how good the acting, but eventually you have to decide for yourself. I can only recommend it.

The 39 Steps,"A man in London tries to help a counter-espionage agent, but when the agent is killed and the man stands accused, he must go on the run to save himself and stop a spy ring that is trying to steal top-secret information.","Trust and betrayal have been a recurrent theme in several of Alfred Hitchcock&apos;s works. The 39 Steps, made in 1935, has the all the classic elements of the master filmmaker that set the standard for later Hitchcock films. The 39 Steps has the classic Hitchcockian theme of an average, innocent man caught up in extraordinary events which are quite beyond his control. The sexually frustrating institution of marriage is another major motif present in the film. The strained and loveless relationship between the crofter and his wife, the placid relationship of the innkeeper and his wife, the (physical) bond between Hannay and Pamela can be examined in terms of degrees of trust between the couples. In fact, the short &apos;acquaintance&apos; between Hannay and Smith and Hannay and the crofter&apos;s wife are also built completely upon trust. It is these couples, and the chemistry between them (or the lack thereof) that drive the entire film.

Over a span of four days, the smart and unflappable protagonist, Richard Hannay (Robert Donat) is involved in a circular journey to prove his innocence and expose the hive of intrigue. He is involved in chases and romantic interludes that take him from London to the Scottish Highlands and back again and he assumes numerous identities on the way - a milkman, an auto mechanic, a honeymooner, a political speaker among others.

The opening of the film, the first three shorts do not show him above his neck. With his back to the camera, he is followed down the aisle to his seat. He is then assumed to be lost in the crowd. This gives the audience the feeling that he could be anybody. Later when he takes in the identities of a milkman, a mechanic, a politician one realizes that he is Hitchcock&apos;s archetypal &apos;everyman&apos; who unwittingly finds himself in incredible dilemmas.

In one of the brilliantly managed sequences on the train, Richard Hannay throws himself at a lone girl and forces a kiss just as a detective and two policemen pass by their compartment. It reveals his desperation to remain free until he can prove his innocence. In the scene after Annabella staggers into his room with a kitchen knife in her back, Hannay sees her ghostly image (which is superimposed) talking to him, `What you are laughing at right now is true. These men will stop at nothing.&apos; The double exposure achieves a result which is a tad chilling and sad. The hallmark of Hitchcock&apos;s style is his ability to completely shock his audience by deliberately playing against how they would be thinking. In such episodes as the murder of the woman in Hannay&apos;s apartment or when the vicious professor with the missing finger casually shoots Hannay, the action progresses almost nonchalantly leaving the viewers stunned.

A great story, interesting and likeable characters, slyly incongruous wit, classic Hitchcockian motifs and a great MacGuffin are just a few things that make the The 39 Steps the quintessential Hitchcock.",,"['Crime', 'Mystery', 'Thriller']","['on the run', 'macguffin', 'female spy', 'military secret', 'british noir']",1935-07-31,['Alfred Hitchcock'],"['Robert Donat', 'Madeleine Carroll', 'Lucie Mannheim']","['John Buchan', 'Charles Bennett', 'Ian Hay']"

Les quatre cents coups,"A young boy, left without attention, delves into a life of petty crime.","Every day life, however &apos;real&apos; and gritty it may be, is rarely portrayed on film and was certainly a rarity in the 1950&apos;s. In Europe however, there was a movement in film-making that embraced this realism and searched for the deeper meaning in the &apos;here and now&apos;. This is about the most basic and miniscule portion of the meaning behind the French New Wave of the 1950&apos;s  films that explored the filmmaker&apos;s surroundings, and eventually became an inspiration for filmmakers around the world. Francois Truffaut&apos;s &apos;The 400 Blows&apos; is one of the most well-known films of this movement, and has been embraced and hailed as one of the greatest films of all time.

After viewing Truffaut&apos;s &apos;The 400 Blows&apos;, I have been ruminating over the deeper meaning behind his story of Antoine Doinel, a 14 year old boy in Paris who is having trouble in school and trouble at home. In school, he is marginalized as a trouble-maker, yet it is obvious that it is more a matter of him causing trouble by expressing himself creatively rather than following along with mundane assignments. At home, Doinel has to deal with an adulterous mother who only pays attention to him when it suits her needs, and a father who is barely present. Doinel responds by doing the only thing he feels he can do, and that is by acting up; eventually earning an expulsion from school and being sent to a juvenile prison camp by his parents. 

Nothing is cut and dry in &apos;The 400 Blows&apos;. If one were to take the film at face value, there would be a &apos;so what&apos; feeling. What the film subtly explores is the disenfranchisement of youth. There is no joy in Doinel&apos;s life  anytime he tries to express himself creatively or acts up in a playful way he is shot down and metaphorically forced back into line. This is not a typical Paris street kid either, this is one who reads Balzac for pleasure and conveys intense emotion. The problem is that no one is there to notice or care. Another aspect of the French New Wave was that the films were not merely a product of a Hollywood factory; these were intensely personal films to the writers and directors. In the case of &apos;The 400 Blows&apos;, it is certain that Doinel is based on Truffaut, himself only 28 when he made the film. Truffaut&apos;s cinematography in &apos;The 400 Blows&apos; is exquisite. We see a Paris that is not in Technicolor with colorful fountains like &apos;An American in Paris&apos;. This is Paris from a Parisian&apos;s perspective  and the difference is breathtaking and intense. These are not Louis XVI style houses, they are tiny flats where people have to sleep in closets and walk up and down six flights of stairs. The city views are those of a native Parisian  the kind of tour one would get if they asked the average Parisian for non-tourist attractions.

There is still a lot that I have to learn and think about &apos;The 400 Blows&apos; and French New Wave in general, but with the minute amount of understanding I have of it, I found it to be an intense film, one that left me emotional and craving enlightenment. Rarely is there a film that leaves that kind of impact on me, but Truffaut managed to leave me speechless and deep in thought with &apos;The Four Hundred Blows&apos;.

This is still watchable, but in my opinion, just lacked that special something. Also there&apos;s way less nudity and rampant violence in this set (although both still there)

"42nd Street Forever, Volume 3: Exploitation Explosion",Synapse Films presents another volume in their best-selling series of classic exploitation trailers. Another collection from the bygone days of New York City&apos;s classic 42nd Street theatres.,"Not long ago (mere weeks ago, in fact), I found on YouTube a New York Public Access show, THE CINEFILES, wherein four New Yorkers- Edwin Samuelson, Eric Cohen, Jeff Gallashaw, and Michael Foltz- THOROUGHLY review movies Old and New. I&apos;ve become addicted to the show to the extent that I&apos;d like to suggest to them that they release their entire series on DVD. Anyone who&apos;s a die-hard movie fan can&apos;t miss this show- it&apos;s absolutely must-see. Even when I don&apos;t agree with them, their comments and their arguments for or against a particular film are compelling entertainment. THE CINEFILES are, to a man, the most ENTERTAINING critics I&apos;ve ever seen. (And I would also suggest that the shows be transferred to DVD just as they are, with no edits to correct errors: these are, after all, Public Access shows and one of the things that I learned over the years is that ANYTHING can happen on a PA show...) I mention THE CINEFILES because Mr. Samuelson is one of the three narrators on the 42nd STREET FOREVER, V.3 commentary. It&apos;s always interesting to revisit some of these trailers, but far more fun to hear what the commentators have to say about them. The one gripe I have, having first been exposed to the in-depth insights of THE CINEFILES, is that there simply isn&apos;t enough TIME for the commentators to comment at length on the trailers. Maybe it&apos;d be a good idea to have the commentators, a la THE CINEFILES, sit around a table and comment at length after each trailer is shown.",9,['Documentary'],"['exploitation film', 'grindhouse film', 'grindhouse theater', 'movie trailer', 'compilation']",2008-01-29,[],"['Michael Gingold', 'Chris Poggiali', 'Edwin Samuelson']",[]
48 Hrs.,A hard-nosed cop reluctantly teams up with a wise-cracking criminal temporarily paroled to him in order to track down a killer.,"Violent criminal Ganz escapes from prison, and is looking for a money stash. He leaves a trail of dead people. Jack Cates (Nick Nolte) survives the shootout. He grabs Ganz acquaintance Reggie Hammond (Eddie Murphy) from prison for 48 hours leave to help track down the killer.

This is gritty rough movie from Walter Hill. The language is rough. It&apos;s not simply swearing. It is viciously vile. Nick Nolte calls Eddie Murphy a lot of racist language without batting an eye. The people are all good and proper low lifes. Even the gun shoots sound meaner. This movie runs on the combustible chemistry between Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy. Eddie Murphy has a bit of fun once in awhile, and Nolte is at his growling best.

The plot outline states that five girls confront Legion. It would have been far more accurate to state that five girls are individually stalked by Legion.

The acting was horrid, even for a B movie, and what decent acting there was in this film was obliterated by shoddy writing and talentless directing.

This receives a two star rating because of the admirable effort Ron and Jordan put in, in spite of the overall result.

The 7th Voyage of Sinbad,"When a princess is shrunken by an evil wizard, Sinbad must undertake a quest to an island of monsters to cure her and prevent a war.","The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad is one of my all time favourite movies. Great cast, great villain, great script and just the right balance of absolutely fantastic Ray Harryhausen special effects (without being excessive or absurd - as in the ridiculous and completely unbelievable baboon who appears to star in the deeply inferior &apos;Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger&apos;, 1977).

Kerwyn Mathews stars as Sinbad minus the traditional beard, but compensates by showing off as much chest hair and his forearms as possible. Critics have describe him as a little wooden but I disagree. I thought he was just great for the part and plays it well. Its not Shakespeare after all. My three year old son still joins in shouting &apos;Parisa !&apos; and &apos;Sakura !&apos; whenever we watch this movie. 

The gorgeous Katherine Grant is a beautiful Princess named Parisa (and not in a slightly sleazy, ever so tartish fashion that we see foisted on Caroline Munro in the 1974 &apos;Golden Voyage of Sinbad&apos;).

Torin Thatcher, born in Bombay and therefore possibly the token &apos;Asian&apos; in this flick, is absolutely marvelous as Sakura, the evil wizard or magician (it&apos;s never made quite clear what side of the fence he sits on, or why). He exudes evil even before it made clear that he&apos;s a resident baddie.

This is a really great family movie above all else. Everyone except the eternally idle, the immature and clinically over-cynical teenagers can sit through this and find something enjoyable - even the music and scenery (the caption reads: Bagdad, but in fact it&apos;s Granada, Spain). I might also add that it makes a very pleasant change to see a movie in English where the bloke who says &apos;Allah&apos; in his sentences is not some dreadful caricatured half-mad terrorist looking to kill innocents. Its good to be able to sit down with the kids and watch a film that everyone likes for a change.

My only, only complaint with this film is the silly voice they have given the child-genie. Very unnecassary and distracting from an otherwise excellent piece of cinema viewing.

8 Mile,,"Those who are saying `8 Mile&apos; shows a vanilla-ed Eminem may have a point: this movie introduces him to a non-rap audience just as `Wild Style&apos; introduced us to hip-hop. But those who say Eminem is sanitized here for mall viewing have an odd notion of language. Perhaps his CD&apos;s contain more inflammatory material than is aired in this movie, but what gets said here is most definitely not for any suburban grandmothers who aren&apos;t stone deaf.

It&apos;s surprising - admirable, really - how well Curtis Hansen and his crew keep track of the plot from scene to scene when not much of it seems to matter other than Rabbit&apos;s problems with his mother, Stephanie Smith -- Kim Basinger. Bassinger is a blue ribbon southern white trash trailor park mom. You can&apos;t help feeling that with minor tweaking she could be the mother of a Grosse Pointe prep school boy, a lady whose problem was overspending instead of imminent eviction from a stinky trailor. Bassinger makes trashiness look attractive, just as she made movie star decay attractive when Hansen directed her in `L.A. Confidential&apos; six years ago. Rabbit&apos;s problems with girlfriends aren&apos;t significant, though he has two of them, an ex and a new one. Both are delicious but primed for rejection. Rabbit&apos;s closest relationships are with his emcee pal `Future&apos; (played by an utterly charming and huggable Mikhi Pfifer) and his slightly retarded token white homie, Cheddar Bob (Evan Jones).

But his closest relationship of all is with himself, as is clear from the first scene, where Eminem is doing rap gestures in the competition shed men&apos;s room, looking in the mirror, hearing his music in his head --and this is fine, because it&apos;s what a young man has to do: get on friendly working terms with who he is. The movie is about his going off to be on his own and give up his rowdy playmates to become a winner, and he walks off by himself in the final scene. The comparison with Shakespeare&apos;s Henry IV isn&apos;t out of place. The Shakespearean parallel was used explicitly for Keanu Reeves&apos; character in `My Own Private Idaho&apos; but the theme is really more central here. Eminem isn&apos;t a cold personality like Keanu Reeves in Van Sant&apos;s movie. He is close to his mates and they&apos;re always touching hands and gently hugging each other. The hands and the hugs are one of the main images that stay with you after seeing `8 Mile.&apos;

Eminem as shown in `8 Mile&apos; isn&apos;t totally motivated by his anger at all. His anger is very contained. He seems able to turn it on and off at will and release it only when he needs it -- to trounce rap competition or throw out his mom&apos;s sleazy boyfriend. It&apos;s his ability to control his anger that makes both Rabbit and Eminem winners.

Eminem does have an authenticity about him that makes for a strong presence on screen. Paradoxically he projects a powerful inwardness, so that his turning away from everybody makes his face jump out at us. His effect is of authenticity, because he doesn&apos;t put on a reaction to please the audience or suit the scene, but he is always there, moving with the scene and in fact creating it.

`8 Mile&apos; isn&apos;t just a vehicle for Eminem. It&apos;s too well made a movie to be that. But without Eminem `8 Mile&apos; wouldn&apos;t exist. The only importance of the rapping contests emceed by `Future&apos; is that first Rabbit shies away from them, and then he enters them and wins them. You have to wonder how the rapper/actors feel who are in the movie only to be put down by Eminem.

`8 Mile&apos; cannot escape from the limitations of the fictionalized star biopic. There have been dozens of movies about emerging music stars and their families, their early sponsors, their first big breaks, and so on, many of them with more range and specificity of detail than this one. This movie only takes its hero to the moment when he walks away, having shown that he can be a star. The whole focus is on his personality, and in particular his stillness. The most important moments are those when Rabbit/Eminem stands with mike in hand, silent, waiting for inspiration to strike. Even when he choses not to compete and hands the mike back, this moment is full of power. In this movie Eminem carries the expression of sheer imminence, raw potential, to a new level of clarity and confidence.

Bud Abbott and Lou Costello Meet Frankenstein,The Wolf Man tries to warn a dimwitted porter that Dracula wants his brain for Frankenstein monster&apos;s body.,"A full moon is on the rise in foggy London when Lawrence Talbot places a panicked phone call to the States. He is the only one who knows that a great evil is on its way to America. Count Dracula and the Frankenstein Monster have been shipped to a wax museum, and when the sun sets, Dracula will rise and summon his superhuman servant. Talbot knows he must warn someone...anyone...but unfortunately, it&apos;s Lou Costello who answers the phone. The movie is then off and running. Dracula needs a new brain for his monster, a brain so simple and dumb that the monster will obey Dracula&apos;s every command. Dracula&apos;s lethal henchwoman, Doctor Sandra Mornay, soon finds the perfect subject. Guess who? Now it&apos;s up to Bud Abbott and Lon Chaney Jr. to save Lou and stop Dracula before Lou literally loses his mind!

This is my absolute favorite Abbott & Costello film, sweet and witty but also dark and spooky, with plenty of nice, Gothic sets filled with full moons, flapping bats, cobwebs and lab equipment. Lon Chaney Jr. as the lycanthropic Lawrence Talbot, Bela Lugosi in his final appearance as Dracula and Glenn Strange as the Monster all play their roles perfectly straight as Bud and Lou stumble around them. The dark and seductive Lenore Aubert makes her second appearance as a Bud and Lou Bad Girl, slinking her way through the entire movie like a black panther, trying to lead poor Lou astray. Best moments include a wax museum in a lightening storm, a costume ball on a moonlit night and an uncredited Vincent Price who shows up - sort of - at films end. Bud and Lou turn in flawless performances yet again; Bud the Straight Guy always ready with a stinging one- liner and Lou the Bumbling Fool, falling all over himself, yet both of them always uniting at the films climax to stop the Bad Guys. 

Fans of Bud and Lou and fans of the Universal Creature Features should not miss this film. It is both a spoof and an homage to the legendary Monsters of film. 10 stars.",10,"['Comedy', 'Family', 'Fantasy']","['spoof', 'crate', 'full moon', 'transformation', 'werewolf']",1948-06-15,"['Charles Barton', 'Walter Lantz']","['Bud Abbott', 'Lou Costello', 'Lon Chaney Jr.']","['Robert Lees', 'Frederic I.

The ABC of Love and Sex: Australia Style,"A tongue-in-cheek sex education documentary covering a different subject for each letter of the alphabet, e.g. A is for Anatomy, B is for Babies, etc.","Again, another so so documentary from Lamond, but he makes this one very entertaining with a clever start. Picture if you will a class of little girls and boys, and their teacher, presented as clay figures as if the makers of The Wombles were in town. This is a funny scene as our eyes and knowledge about sex is really about to be expanded and what better way as if through the alphabet. This includes lesbianism, masturbation, and even RAPE. I couldn&apos;t believe that when we reached the letter P, prostitution wasn&apos;t mentioned. We do skip a letter here and there, though. What we got here is a fun documentary, that never bores, with actors so cheesy they&apos;re funny, if perfect, and that&apos;s what bad acting is, funny, as is some of the male V.O.&apos;s dialogue. One scene has a couple in bed, and when you think the middle aged male is gonna pull out his schlong, he pulls out a bunch of roses. There&apos;s a blonde hottie, who looks great, fully stark, massaging the biggest blown up penis I&apos;ve ever seen. John Michael Howson, a favorite with John Lamond, plays a gay party crasher in biker gear where he makes this hilarious remark, typical of his mouth. What really cheesed me off about this movie was the dance sequence, amidst the big letter blocks, used at the start and it&apos;s finish that was just warranted, if bloody annoying. We even have a overseas sex expert give her opinion on the subject. Overall this documentary, a popular hit at the drive in, is a fun way to kill 76 minutes, and Lamond fan, like I am (although Breakfast in Paris nearly bored me to tears) do recommend this for couples in the mood, or for people who just want a good laugh. It&apos;s funnier than a few bad comedies, I&apos;ve seen, I can tell ya. And remember, couples that play together stay together.

Ace in the Hole,"A frustrated former big-city journalist now stuck working for an Albuquerque newspaper exploits a story about a man trapped in a cave to rekindle his career, but the situation quickly escalates into an out-of-control circus.","The movie very closely parallels the real events of January 30 to February 16, 1925 in terms of the general story line. There are some significant differences concerning the actions of the characters.

Floyd Collins, a cave explorer working alone (not a real good idea), was trapped in Sand Cave KY, near Mammoth Cave. He was not looking for treasure, but for a new cave suitable for commercializing to produce income in an economically depressed region...and this was before the Depression occurred.

He became trapped on the way out of the cave by a 27 lb. rock which rolled onto his leg in a narrow crawlway. The configuration was such that it could not be moved enough to get his foot past.

When he failed to return home, the family went searching and quickly found him only 150&apos; inside the cave.

A huge rescue effort was mounted and a cub reporter, Skeets Miller, from Louisville KY showed up to cover the story. It became one of the three most widely broadcast events of the time. Besides the extensive newspaper coverage, the relatively new medium of commercial radio riveted listeners with hourly accounts. It quickly became the first media circus ever seen.

Because of the print and radio coverage people began flocking to the site. A carnival atmosphere did indeed spring up around the cave. The state police and National Guard were called out by the governor to control the chaos and the more than 20,000 onlookers. The similarity between the real event and the movie on this account are likely nearly identical.

As in the movie, a decision was made to drill a shaft and, also as in the movie, the rock was fairly unstable and prone to collapse from the pounding of the cable tool drilling rig. The longer the effort went on, the more unstable the cave passage became.

Unlike Kirk Douglas&apos; character in the movie, Skeets Miller served a most honorable role. Due to his small build he became one of very few persons able, and eventually the only one willing, to enter in an attempt to deliver food and water to Collins. He received a Pulitzer Prize for his reporting. Also unlike the movie, there was no manipulation of the event to delay the rescue, but there was considerable disagreement over how to best do it. Area coal miners made the initial attempts and the event concluded with the above-mentioned shaft.

Collins was presumed to have died 3 days before rescuers reached him. Because the conditions were so unstable, the body was left in the cave. The family was able to remove him about 80 days afterward for a proper burial. Later, his glass-topped casket was returned to the now-commercial cave as a tourist attraction. It was removed once again, and finally, in 1989.

In 1982, a definitive account of the event was published in the book &apos;Trapped!&apos;. A most informative read.

The Miami Dolphins mascot is stolen and by word-of-mouth advertising Ace Ventura (Jim Carrey) is called into manic action.

Jim Carrey is quite simply amazing, I never stopped laughing the whole way through the movie. This is surely Carrey&apos;s best work, even now. OK, Dumb and Dumber and The Mask are very funny movies too, but this takes the biscuit. Everything Ace does made me laugh, from whipping football player&apos;s with a towel to get a ring imprint to showing up at a mansion party and being his usual manic self.

The Addams Family,Con artists plan to fleece an eccentric family using an accomplice who claims to be their long-lost uncle.,"Extremely enjoyable update to the old t.v. show retains the eccentric spookiness and oddball humor of old, then proceeds to update the warped family familiarity with a rousing sense of decadent glee. The unexpectedly classy affair benefits greatly from the amazing casting that went into choosing all the Addams clan. What is nothing short of ensemble perfection, a sense of fun had by all on set during production remains undeniably infectious throughout, lending the amusing proceedings a distinct level of class.

Directed by easily digestible Barry Sonnenfeld, The Addams Family may be a bit intense for young kids but should stay a delight to all others. A wonderful, gentle perversity that hangs over the entire family might have pushed things a little too far to justify this family film to the younger set, but will stay surprisingly balanced with an outpouring of heart and morality,simply flipped inside out here, for comedic intent.

Wonderful set and prop design mixed with it&apos;s politely warped sense of humor would have been enough to make Addams Family the success it became, although it was the brilliant casting which continues to uphold a credibility for this film. Led by the outstanding (and sadly missed) Raul Julia, nearly every single family member wears their role with an unreal amount of dignity, making the fairly standard plot completely memorable.",8,"['Comedy', 'Fantasy']","['uncle', 'black comedy', 'graveyard', 'goth', 'husband wife relationship']",1991-11-22,['Barry Sonnenfeld'],"['Anjelica Huston', 'Raul Julia', 'Christopher Lloyd']","['Charles Addams', 'Caroline Thompson', 'Larry Wilson']"
The Addiction,"A New York philosophy grad student turns into a vampire after getting bitten by one, and then tries to come to terms with her new lifestyle and frequent craving for human blood.","This movie was even scarier for me since I spent 2/3 of my life in New York City and all the settings were in my family&apos;s neighborhood!

The acting was first rate, as was the storyline and cinematography, but all the philosophical dissertations annoyed the HELL out of me because it reminded me of some of the intellectual snobs I went to school with who had lower IQ&apos;s than my cat.

Upon reading the previous review, it just occurred to me that all the snobbery made perfect sense.

The character was probably in shock for several weeks. In HER mind, a vampire wouldn&apos;t resist his or her impulses they would just become feral. As such, to her, this constant internal dialogue of trying to figure out whether or not her addictions are psychological or supernatural somehow proves her normalcy (at least in her universe).

Christopher Walken was GENIUS and so convincing that I never EVER want to meet him in person! His explanation of his adaptation to his vampirism made it seem so normal (it REALLY felt like he was giving the audience a confession under the guise of acting) that you got the sense that he WASN&apos;T acting!

I have to say that the graduation scene is one of the single most disturbing things that I have ever seen in my life!

It seems like its a spoof, of what, I do not know however. Perhaps of comic-book type of movies from the &apos;80&apos;s, or adventurous serials from the &apos;30&apos;s/40&apos;s? But then again there&apos;s the problem that the movie is not really funny and on top of that, also not so very well made. Guess the movie can best be seen as a cult-classic, for the fans of it.

To be honest, the movie began well and promising. It developed some potentially interesting characters and plot lines but for some reason as the movie progresses they don&apos;t get handled well. The movie becomes more crazy and crazy as the movie heads toward the ending. At one point I even stopped caring and wanting to understand what the movie was all about. It was confusing, it was poor but above all it was odd.

The movie could had been fun, the movie could had been action filled but yet it all isn&apos;t. It&apos;s wasted potential, cause I guess that in essence Buckaroo Banzai isn&apos;t really a bad fun movie main-hero.

The movie is only fun now really with its character&apos;s names. All of the alien&apos;s their first name is John and they have names such as John Bigboote, John O&apos;Connor and John Smallberries. But other than that, there isn&apos;t really much fun present in the movie. The many famous actors however still provide the movie with some fun and this uplifts the movie. Amazing how many great actors are in this movie such as Ellen Barkin, Jeff Goldblum, Christopher Lloyd, Clancy Brown, Ronald Lacey, Vincent Schiavelli and Dan Hedaya. John Lithgow is deliciously overacting as the movie its main villain but I just wish that he had more sequences and was made more interesting as a character. Peter Weller was a great leading man in the &apos;80&apos;s and he shows with this movie how well he can carry a movie.

The special effects are all decent for &apos;80&apos;s standards but perhaps overused a bit too much. The musical score is typically &apos;80&apos;s like and absolutely horrible. Further more the movie is fairly well looking, too bad inexperienced director W.D. Richter doesn&apos;t know how to use everything to its full potential.

Yet it&apos;s not all that bad and the movie still entertains, so the movie obviously still has some redeeming qualities which makes this still a bit of a watchable movie.

Die Abenteuer des Prinzen Achmed,"A handsome prince rides a flying horse to faraway lands and embarks on magical adventures, which include befriending a witch, meeting Aladdin, battling demons and falling in love with a princess.","THE ADVENTURES OF PRINCE ACHMED pit him against the evil African Sorcerer in an attempt to rescue beautiful Princess Peri Banu from terrible peril.

German filmmaker Lotte Reiniger (1899-1981) was fascinated with cutouts and puppetry from childhood. After seeing a silent film by the great Georges Méliès as a teenager, she knew that movies would be her destiny. Reiniger loved make believe and would eventually make films on a whole series of fabulous characters, from Dr. Dolittle (1928) and Puss in Boots (1936) to Thumbelina (1954) and Hansel & Gretel (1955).

Reiniger&apos;s area of expertise was in silhouette animation. Using a pair of scissors, she produced amazingly elaborate images from black paper and then had them back-lit and photographed one frame at a time, moving the cutouts slightly each time, thereby producing the illusion of movement. Her masterwork, after three years of labor, was THE ADVENTURES OF PRINCE ACHMED, produced eleven years before Disney&apos;s SNOW WHITE, thus becoming the world&apos;s first animated feature film.

The movie tells an exciting story from the world of the Arabian Nights, full of magic, menace & monsters, and incorporates the tale of Aladdin and his love for Achmed&apos;s sister Dinarzade, thus giving the movie two valiant heroes instead of only one. The romantic exploits are slightly leavened with a touch of delightful decadence and good humor, exemplified by Achmed&apos;s few moments in the seraglio on the magical Isle of Waq Waq.

It is fascinating how these pieces of black paper can evoke an emotional response from the viewer. It is a testimony to the wonderful artistry of their creator, Lotte Reiniger, a woman who richly deserves to be more celebrated by those interested in cinema history.",10,"['Animation', 'Adventure', 'Family']","['arabian nights', 'silhouette', 'silent', 'mythical', 'looking at oneself in a mirror']",,"['Lotte Reiniger', 'Carl Koch']",[],['Lotte Reiniger']

After Hours,An ordinary word processor has the worst night of his life after he agrees to visit a girl in Soho he met that evening at a coffee shop.,"Martin Scorsese has always been a master of kinetic filmmaking but After Hours is really where he starts cranking up the energy even more. This movie is simply alive in a way that most movies aren&apos;t. Everyone in it has a story to tell and we&apos;re ready to hear them all.

From the cocktail waitress who seems stuck in the 1960s to the ice cream truck driver who wears a rape whistle to the stoic bouncer outside the punk bar and of course the sculptor who lives under the bar and has no scruples about using live subjects, there are so many weirdos in this film it&apos;s fantastic.

I&apos;ve seen plenty of New York movie but I&apos;m not sure I&apos;ve ever seen any make the city feel so oppressively large. There&apos;s a great sense of space in this film and it genuinely feels hopeless for Paul to try to get home, which could sound like a dumb premise for a movie until you see it handled here. The journey is downright epic and Scorsese uses every visual technique he learned in school to keep the tempo cruising through this long trip.

I wasn&apos;t bored for a second at any point during After Hours and you won&apos;t be either. This film is alive and Thelma Schoonmaker does maybe the best work of her great career at an editing bay. She should&apos;ve gotten an Oscar nomination.

But for any person who has spent any time in Italy--whether in an urban center such as Rome or the Italian equivalent of Mayberry--this movie is hilarious. The writers and performers have captured the essence of the Italian personality as well as the spirit of the abrasive American personality.

L&apos;âge d&apos;or,"A surrealist tale of a man and a woman who are passionately in love with each other, but their attempts to consummate that passion are constantly thwarted by their families, the Church, and bourgeois society.","After completing Un Chien Andalusia with Salvador Dali (who helped write the screenplay) Bunuel began his new film titled L&apos;age D&apos;or, translated as The Golden Age. Altho not entirely collaborating on the screenplay, Dali still received his credential for L&apos;age D&apos;or; however, this film was primarily a sole project for Bunuel. In this film Bunuel attacks religion with the famous image of a skeletal clergy resting on the shore of Catalonia. In addition, the film contains other sensational and bizarre imagery (i.e. a cow laying on a bed, a woman having a bowel movement, a man with a boulder on his head, a festering wound on a man&apos;s eye, and the like). Obviously, L&apos;age D&apos;or was controversial at it&apos;s time, and still is for some audiences. However, the films takes at least 3 times to completely understand Bunuel&apos;s symbolism (the way I saw it), as well as the ambiguous conclusion which is still a bit hazy for me. The film&apos;s pace is rather slow and can be dull at moments; nevertheless, it takes a lot of patience to even enjoy this film, considering the irregular structure of the story-line. However, that doesn&apos;t mean the film is a bomb: it&apos;s definitely a standard in the history of art-and-film, influencing a dozen surrealist filmmakers (ie, Cocteau, Fellini) as well as underground directors. In Short, this film will start to grow on the viewer after several viewings. Bunuel was ahead of his time as a director, therefore L&apos;age D&apos;or may seem out of place for todays audiences as well as todays critics.",,"['Comedy', 'Drama']","['surrealism', 'experimental film', 'absurd humor', 'cult film', 'dark comedy']",1979-11-01,['Luis Buñuel'],"['Gaston Modot', 'Lya Lys', 'Caridad de Laberdesque']","['Luis Buñuel', 'Salvador Dalí', 'Marquis de Sade']"

Aileen Wuornos, dubbed America&apos;s first female serial killer and a woman who killed seven men, is the topic of Broomfield&apos;s investigation. He draws attention to the circumstances surrounding the media and Hollywood deals and the characteristics of Wuornos&apos;s lawyer and a Christian woman (who adopts Aileen and becomes her spiritual mother) and exposes their agenda. Rather than give insight to the crimes itself, Broomfield reveals the sensationalism of the event, and the people involved with Aileen. This is hardly a brilliant documentary but essential viewing as we see Broomfield struggle to get his interview with Aileen where the compelling factor revolves around the circumstances of the process and people involved itself!

Airport,"A bomber on board an airplane, an airport almost closed by snow, and various personal problems of the people involved.","Watching AIRPORT today is like watching a parody of the film because of all of the spinoffs that followed, including the hilarious AIRPLANE! And sometimes you have to wonder about the humor--especially the scene where the priest slaps a hysterical man across the aisle without even a glance at him. 

But the sub-plots (and there are quite a few) hold together very well and at the center of all the suspense is a humorous plot involving a little old lady stowaway (Helen Hayes). Her interrogation scene with Jean Seberg is priceless and all the way through she shows a remarkable talent for scene-stealing. It&apos;s hard to watch anyone else when she&apos;s going through her paces.

The suspense build-up is slow but steady once the plane takes off in a snowstorm--and by the way, the snow effects are very realistic for a change--almost as though the film was shot in a real blizzard, which it probably wasn&apos;t.

This is well played by the entire cast--with the exception of Dean Martin who looks too casual even when the plane is making a final, desperate landing. He never gets inside his role as a pilot. Burt Lancaster doesn&apos;t do much with his character either--but everyone else shines. Maureen Stapleton is touching as the worried wife of the bomber (Van Heflin). Heflin was in his last film role here, looking rather flabby and worn but good as the paranoid bomber. 

Too bad that two of the male leads gave less than adequate performances. It would have helped considerably to make us believe more in the overall tale.

After a while, he lets the leaves grow into a tree but then people start hanging around on his head so he tears the tree off leaving a hole with water. As all this happens, a narrator tells what goes on in various pitches. This was such an interestingly weird short that I may watch it again to catch up on all the images.

In general, the acting is forced. Everyone is dialed up to eleven. It may be a director&apos;s direction. He&apos;s trying to push uncomfortableness into every shot. It&apos;s all very deliberate but it does feel forced. It gives an interesting mannered tone to this small horror. My best description would be John Waters doing horror.

All Is Lost,"After a collision with a shipping container at sea, a resourceful sailor finds himself, despite all efforts to the contrary, staring his mortality in the face.","J.C. Chandor is a lucky man. After scoring an Oscar nomination with his 2011 screenplay and debut Margin Call, he swiftly got the opportunity to work one-on-one with another original script and a silver screen legend, Robert Redford. Unfortunately, Chandor is not a reliable hand behind a pen. After a promising first act and a killer ensemble, Margin Call seems to lose the will to live with no momentum, tension or really, drama, moving it towards the moment where the film sort of has to end. However, despite what its prologue may tell you, All Is Lost has the will to live. In fact, that&apos;s all its got as it wrestles through its narrative. The premise is both ambitious and minimal. It&apos;s a premise that you hear and wonder how someone could make a compelling film out of something so vague. Well All Is Lost achieves it, but holds onto that vagueness. I can&apos;t really recall the details of what happens besides miscellaneous actions, but this is a film about the experience and taking you along for the ride.

From a technical standpoint and for an independent film, it&apos;s rather unmatched. It may not be wide in scale, but it&apos;s convincing in the details of its design. Whereas sea-bound films such as Life Of Pi have been distracting for the moments where its pool sets are clearly apparent, All Is Lost is thoroughly convincing that we are forever in the middle of the ocean through its cinematography and special effects. I wish the editing didn&apos;t jump around as much, it was impossible to truly get immersed in the situations and the weight of the challenges. But most importantly besides the visuals, it&apos;s a soundscape. With much of the sources of the sounds coming offscreen, the conviction of the sound editing and mixing are astonishing and often frightening. The one dip out of the fly-on-the-wall approach is the score which appropriately highlights the films best and most poignant moments. But in a one-man band, it all hinges on our lead. Our Man, Robert Redford. 

I&apos;ve only seen him in a collection of 60s and 70s classics and I know at the very least he is a confident and often charming lead. I know him more for his direction work with his Oscar winning Ordinary People and Oscar deserving Quiz Show. All Is Lost was quickly pronounced his opus so I was intrigued given his reputation. With no dialogue to work with, his performance is in his overwhelmed but quiet expressions that try to grasp what little soul he has left. Surprisingly, it&apos;s not a showy performance but one that perfectly blends into the texture of the film. However, it doesn&apos;t achieve what Gravity achieves when faced with the risk of mortality. We don&apos;t know enough about Our Man, his story doesn&apos;t mean enough to us. Instead, we&apos;re left with a strong melancholy. As like Margin Call, the film simply deflates from its tragedy, and while they may try, characters can&apos;t do anything against the obstacles Chandor puts in front of them. At least this was a little more believable.

Lew Ayres is the student leader of a bunch of German school boys in 1914 who listen to the voice of their school master and enlist in the war that&apos;s just been declared. The whole class enlists and that&apos;s not hyperbole because in Germany at the time it was the boys who got the education and the girls if they got it, got it separately from the boys. 

I&apos;m sure that viewers of All Quiet on the Western Front today probably are asking why that school master and so many of his generation were urging their youth on to such folly. Very simply that their generation had a quick victory in 1870 in the Franco-Prussian War. Every generation since wars were recorded figures their war experience will be the same for their children.

Only it wasn&apos;t. On the western front the Allied and Central Powers armies were locked in a bitter stalemate that ran diagonally across France and Belgium from the English Channel to the Swiss border. This went on for a little over four years. In fact had it not been for the fact that America joined the Allied side and the French and British held out until they did, I&apos;m sure an honest armistice would have been declared long before November 11, 1918.

You lived, fought and died in those trenches. Either you were defending or you were attacking the other guy&apos;s trenches against murderous automatic weapon fire and long distance artillery batteries. All Quiet on the Western Front was the first great war film of the American sound era and graphically shows that.

And it shows that from the enemy perspective. That&apos;s something today&apos;s audience can&apos;t appreciate, the fact that the film was from the Wilhelmine German perspective. Remember these were the enemy a dozen years before. But the experience in the trenches was universal.

Lew Ayres became a star with this film and it effected him so deeply that he became a committed pacifist which caused later problems in his career. He&apos;s the voice of reason and civilization and the voice of a lost generation of Germans who would never have listened to the demagogic appeals of the Nazis. 

Louis Wolheim plays the veteran soldier who befriends Ayres and his school boy chums and teaches them how to survive in the trenches. It turned out to be his greatest role. He was a brutish looking man and played mostly those types in silent films. All Quiet on the Western Front would have been the start of a whole new career opening. But Wolheim died the following year just as he was to start filming The Front Page. Adolphe Menjou took the part of Walter Burns in that film which Wolheim was to have.

The third really stand out performance is that of John Wray who some might remember as the brutal prison guard in Each Dawn I Die. Wray plays an officious mail man who is in the German Army Reserve. He gets called up and this little nobody gets rather impressed with himself and his new found authority as a training sergeant to Ayres and his friends. Later on at the front, he gets a view of combat he wasn&apos;t quite ready for.

All Quiet on the Western Front with its eternal message of peace and life will be one eternal film, it will be shown and appreciated for many generations to come.",10,"['Drama', 'War']","['1910s', 'anti war', 'shell shock', 'ptsd post traumatic stress disorder', 'depression']",1930-08-24,['Lewis Milestone'],"['Lew Ayres', 'Louis Wolheim', 'John Wray']","['Erich Maria Remarque', 'Maxwell Anderson', 'George Abbott']"

All the Boys Love Mandy Lane,"A group of high-schoolers invite Mandy Lane, an innocent, desirable girl, to a weekend party on a secluded ranch. While the festivities rage on, the number of revelers begins to drop mysteriously.","This film is definitely unusual. Not a lot really happens, there is a massive amount of time spent getting to know the characters and most of the action is condensed into the last half hour. I am all up for characterisation but there really isn&apos;t an awful lot to the characters, and they partake on a whole load of mundane yet embarrassing behaviour. For instance in one scene the girls are talking, one whips down her trousers to sit on the toilet and her friend starts ribbing her about her pubic hair. The film carries on in this general manner, although not graphic or titillating or offensive this snap shot into the lives of over-sexed American teens is just kind of embarrassing to watch (especially with relatives). The camera hovers at breast height for the majority of the film especially when Mandy is running or jumping which is great!, but again makes you feel a bit guilty you are watching so avidly (maybe it is an English thing).

The film gets plus points for...

Good production but not overly glossy.

The gore has been kept down but the murders still make you wince.

Stays inside the classic 90 minute barrier.

Keeps you guessing, you will work out the ending ahead of time but not before mixing it up with lots of other theories.

Over all it is an okay film, takes a while to heat up then burns out fast. No notable moments of horror genius, but no really terrible movie blunders either.

All the Kind Strangers,"A man traveling through a backwoods area is held hostage by a group of orphans who want him to become their father. Unfortunately, the kids have a habit of killing adults who refuse that particular honor.","The story here is about backwoods children who lure unsuspecting adults to their house in the deep forest where they imprison them and force them to be their parents. Those who do not shape up are killed. It&apos;s an interesting idea and its played out pretty well. It has an effective off-kilter atmosphere, even if it never really gets very tense. The acting was decent enough with some good players like Stacey &apos;The Long Riders&apos; Keach, Samantha &apos;The Brood&apos; Eggar and a young John &apos;Salvador&apos; Savage. 

I do have a fondness for 70&apos;s TV movies to be fair and I did see this one when I was very young on UK daytime television sometime around 1980. I couldn&apos;t actually remember it though so it was interesting to see it again all these years later. I might be in the minority possibly but I also liked the title song. It was a very early 70&apos;s idea to include these types of breezy folk-pop songs in movies and I am always a bit of a sucker for this kind of thing and it does add a certain cozy charm here.",7,"['Horror', 'Thriller']","['running through the woods', 'manipulative behavior', 'vietnam war veteran', 'absent mother', 'absent father']",1974-11-12,['Burt Kennedy'],"['Stacy Keach', 'Samantha Eggar', 'John Savage']",['Clyde Ware']

All the President&apos;s Men,,"After the flawed but fascinating &apos;Parallax View&apos;, Alan J. Pakula learns from his mistakes, and delivers a more logical and satisfying story in &apos;All the Presidents Men&apos;. Everything about this movie is of the highest quality. Another bravado turn from cinematographer Gordon Willis creates a world of intensely glaring lights and ominously inky shadows. Subtle and realistic performances from the entire cast create a believable pressroom atmosphere of rivalry, idealism and integrity.

The story has been the prototype for every conspiracy thriller since, establishing all the motifs that would eventually be exhausted by &apos;The X-Files&apos; and become cliché. The narrative flows smoothly, and Goldman does an excellent job of reigning in a potentially incomprehensible plot line, a feat that won him a much-deserved Oscar. The story does, however, slow down in spots, becoming repetitious, and could have benefited from a little judicious pruning.

An excellent movie, that not only sheds light on a historic episode without the usual glossy spin, but highlights the pitiful condition of modern journalism, a fall from grace that in time will prove to far more terrifying and long reaching than anything perpetrated by Nixon and his cronies.",8,"['Drama', 'History', 'Thriller']","['investigative journalism', 'watergate', 'newspaper', 'journalist', 'scandal']",1976-04-09,['Alan J.

The system from the state is under the spell from a large, intelligent computer, alpha 60, which cares about nearly everything.

Altered States,A psycho-physiologist experiments with drugs and a sensory-deprivation tank and has visions he believes are genetic memories.,"Bizarre cinematic head-trip that is far better and more entertaining than anyone could guess from a description. I put it on my Netflix queue without realizing it was directed by Ken Russell. If I had seen that earlier, I would have avoided it. Thankfully I didn&apos;t. It contains everything that is good about Russell, that is, his crazy imagery, and none of the bad stuff. That is, it&apos;s not an enormous bore. The script was written by Paddy Chayefsky, based on his own novel. Not the writer you would associate with horror or sci-fi, which is the proper genres to which Altered States belongs. He disowned the film before he even saw a cut of it, despite the fact that Russell was contractually obligated not to change a word of the script. The greatest asset of the film is the fantastic acting. William Hurt makes his screen debut as a mad scientist, a Harvard professor, actually, who is experimenting with sensory deprivation, mixed with some choice hallucinogens. He hopes to lose his modern mind in the sensory deprivation tank and regress to a primitive state. Unfortunately, some mushrooms that he finds in Mexico help him regress not only mentally, but physiologically. Blair Brown plays his estranged and worried wife, and Charles Haid and Bob Balaban (love the Balaban!) play colleagues who help Hurt do his experiments. The plot is silly, but it&apos;s legitimately eerie and frightening, thanks to Russell&apos;s surprisingly excellent direction. The film ends up in territory very reminiscent of 2001: A Space Odyssey, but I thought it all worked pretty well.

The Amazing Transparent Man,A crazed scientist invents an invisibility formula. He plans to use the formula to create an army of invisible zombies.,"Some aspects of Ulmer&apos;s Amazing Transparent Man are, in retrospect, pretty funny. James Griffith&apos;s poorly mimed fight with an invisible man, the occasional continuity disasters, and the infrequent technobabble are examples. This is not, however, quite funny enough or cheesy enough to have been good MST3K fodder. Underlying the mediocre special effects, the occasionally overblown dialog, and the uneven performances, the story line presents an interesting take on the invisible man theme.

The heavy, played without much verve by James Griffith, is an ex-Nazi spy who looks and speaks like Mr. Rogers. His plan, involving all manners of extortion, involves forcing refugee German scientist (Ivan Triesault) to use radiation to turn an escaped convict safe-cracker (Douglas Kennedy) invisible. His goal is ostensibly to steal money and radioactive materials to further his experiments. In the role of his co-conspirator and femme fatale we find Marguerite Chapman.

Chapman and Kennedy have some on-screen chemistry which is used to good advantage in the film, but Chapman&apos;s performance is below par. Kennedy does well in a role which used his experience well. Griffith&apos;s performance, given his credentials, is surprisingly poor. The ancient and experienced Triesault, the class of the acting talent in this film, steals the show to an extent, but is also the only really sympathetic character in the lot.

The movie has a somewhat plodding pace at first, but the character development is good enough to draw the audience in. The Amazing Transparent Man is no action film, but once the action begins, it doesn&apos;t really let up until the nicely climactic end. Despite all of the bad press this film has received here on IMDb, this film really isn&apos;t a bomb, and I recommend it to sci-fi and low budget b movie buffs.",5,"['Horror', 'Sci-Fi']","['psychotronic film', 'mushroom cloud', 'radio broadcast', 'low budget sci fi movie', 'american film directed by czech director']",,['Edgar G.

Amazon Women on the Moon,"A spoof of low budget 1950s science-fiction movies, interspersed with various comedy sketches and fake commercials making fun of late-night television.","It&apos;s really hard to give a score to this movie, as I have seen two or three different versions of the film. The original version appears to have been re-edited to remove some of the dirtier skits (and there were quite a few). Then, less funny skits that were apparently left on the editing room floor were substituted--with less than glowing results.

When the movie is funny, it is side-splittingly funny (especially the teenager buying condoms, the funeral, and Lou Jacobi re-appearing throughout the movie after he is sucked into the television set) but it also tends to fall flat from time to time. This unevenness is probably due to the fact that this movie had MANY different directors--each directing their own skits and then the movie was pieced back together. The end result is highly reminiscent of a better version of Kentucky Fried Movie.

My advice is, see the original un-edited version--but WITHOUT the kids! The edited version just isn&apos;t all that funny.",7,"['Comedy', 'Sci-Fi']","['blonde', 'female nudity', 'prostitute', 'public nudity', 'sketch comedy']",1987-09-18,"['Joe Dante', 'Carl Gottlieb', 'Peter Horton']","['Rosanna Arquette', 'Michelle Pfeiffer', 'Arsenio Hall']","['Michael Barrie', 'Jim Mulholland']"

The American Dreamer,"A documentary about actor/director Dennis Hopper, showing him at his home and studio putting together his film The Last Movie (1971).","This warts-and-all documentary of Dennis Hopper at home in Taos, New Mexico, in the period after the filming but before the release of his amazing THE LAST MOVIE, provides a fascinating window into a world that is forever gone and probably only lasted for a short time: the period when the sixties were over but we were still running on fumes from the sixties and things had not yet crashed and burned. This was a year when you could go see a film like VANISHING POINT at a mainstream movie theater and when THE LAST MOVIE was released by a major studio. I was an adolescent at that time and can testify that Hopper represented a heroic image to many of us back then. I never got to see this film at the time because it did not get much distribution. How interesting to see it thirty-three years later. Hopper raises so many interesting questions and issues in THE American DREAMER, but rambler and dreamer that he is, he moves on without stopping to analyze or apply any of it. Perhaps Mr. Hopper expected US to make the next move fueled by the ideas he threw us. The film itself shows Hopper at home editing what would become THE LAST MOVIE, pontificating on all kinds of subjects regarding the arts, society, sex, drugs,his own legacy, and life in general. Intercut with this is footage of Hopper taking his clothes off on the street in a residential neighborhood, shooting various guns, talking with representatives from Universal about THE LAST MOVIE, walking around. Voice-overs of Hopper thinking aloud are played during these scenes. The music is an assemblage of vaguely philosophical stoner folk that perfectly reflects the atmosphere. Hopper talks about honesty in film, and he certainly lives by his own ideology as this is one of the least flattering artist-approved film biographies I&apos;ve ever seen. Bob Dylan&apos;s DON&apos;T LOOK BACK and Woody Allen&apos;s WILD MAN BLUES are the only other films about well-known celebrities I&apos;d include on the same shelf. If Mr. Hopper owns the rights to this, he should definitely release it on DVD. By the way, I mentioned earlier about the sixties crashing and burning (as symbolized in the final scene of VANISHING POINT). The film that for me documents the final nail in the coffin of the sixties spirit is WONDERLAND.",10,"['Documentary', 'Biography']","['independent filmmaking', 'film making', 'creative process', 'film maker', 'making of']",,"['L.M.

American Graffiti,A group of teenagers in California&apos;s central valley spend one final night after their 1962 high school graduation cruising the strip with their buddies before they pursue their varying goals.,"In 1962, I was 19 years old. So, don,t ask me if I can relate to the movie American Graffiti. Music, emotions, friends, drive-ins, THAT WAS MY LIFE.. . and many scenes remind me of that good time, before making adult decisions.

Darn, Curt leaves friends and family to persue studies in the East. I left friends and family to start my carreer as a jounalist in a small town weekly newspaper in 1963. And YES, I sured danced to music and songs provided by a real little musical groups. The Platters were standard fare for slow dances. Those sock ups dances in gymnasiums were soooooo full of different kinds of emotions. My Wolfman Jack was Joey Reynolds, then a fast talking DJ, at WKBW, in Buffalo, that came in strong at night in Montreal. And yes, I went back years later to my old high school to walk in the halls, like Curt, and remember ... remember friends that I still had and those that had moved into their own world of responsabilities and out of mine. All the songs in me movie can stick to something I lived listening to them, as they came out, got airplay and made me dance or fall in love, if not both. My Mel&apos;S Drive In was a A & W drive in and, yes, in our gang there was a 1957 Chevrolet, with a boosted motor under the hood. Milner would have loved to drive it. I could go on and on.... Don&apos;t ask me if it&apos;s a great movie. For me, it&apos;s a window on my youth and, darn, did I have a great time. So, for me, the movie is GREAT !. I always watch it with a broad smile on my face. No nostalgia goose bumps for me.

Andrey Rublyov,"The life, times and afflictions of the fifteenth-century Russian iconographer St. Andrei Rublev.","Andrei Rublev (alternately transliterated as Andrei Rublyov) is an epic film created by the Soviet-era director, Andrei Tarkovsky. It was financed and created during a brief cultural thaw in East-West relations, marked by the end of Kruschchev&apos;s reign. Within reason, the 205 minute director&apos;s cut represents exactly what Tarkovsky wanted in the movie. Unfortunately for Tarkovsky and for us, Kruschev was deposed shortly after filming began, and the 205 minute version was not seen until twenty five years after its creation. The Breszhnev-era censors first trimmed 15 minutes from it, then censors and marketers trimmed more. The shortest known version has been truncated to 145 minutes. Even more sadly, Tarkovsky was never again to get approval for the projects he really wanted to film, or an adequate budget to film the ones that did get approved.

Fortunately for us, this movie, recently rereleased in a DVD transferred from a pristine 35mm print, may now be viewed intact, and it is one of the great triumphs of mankind&apos;s stay on the planet. It is a masterpiece almost without flaw. The beautiful painterly images follow one another in breathtaking succession. At least three of the eight chapters, if taken individually, could stand alone as separate masterpieces.

The ostensible subject is the life of Andrei Rublev, a 15th century monk who is renowned as Russia&apos;s greatest creator of religious icons and frescoes. Rublev himself, however, is merely a useful device. Little is known about him, and most of the episodes in the movie come straight from Tarkovsky&apos;s imagination of what might have been. Sometimes one must ignore the facts to get to the truth.

The movie is not about one talented monk, but about Russia, and Rublev stands in as a useful symbol since he lived in a time when he could personally witness two of the key elements in the development of Russia&apos;s unique culture: the growing force of Byzantine Christianity, and the Mongol-Tatar invasions. In addition he was an artist and a thinker, and experienced first-hand the difficulty of following those paths in Russia. Rublev&apos;s own inner conflicts allow the filmmaker to illuminate thoughts on the pagan and the sacred, the nature of art, the relationship of the artist to the state, what it means to be Russian, and what it means to be human.

It is beautiful, mystical, and profound, but the truly inspiring aesthetics are matched with complete technical wizardry. I simply don&apos;t know how some of the shots were created. One I do understand, and stand in awe of, is a continuous single camera shot, just before the church door is breached by Tatar invaders, which involves action in several different locations at multiple elevations as well as the correct timing of hundreds of extras and horses. It makes the first scene of Touch of Evil look like a high school film project.

It is a difficult movie to follow. One might liken it to James Joyce&apos;s Finnegan&apos;s Wake as a work of genius so monumental and complex, and so disdainful of traditional narrative form, that it requires extensive thought and study to understand it. And even after studying it, watching it repeatedly, and reading Tarkovsky&apos;s own comments about it, one still finds it opaque in many ways.

Tarkovsky was free to create the work of art he wanted, without concern for profit. The original 205 minute cut was also free from outside censorship. He used this freedom to realize his personal artistic vision. There is no other movie like it, and there may never be. Score it 11 out of 10.",9,"['Biography', 'Drama', 'History']","['15th century', 'painter', 'religious art', 'slow cinema', 'genius']",,['Andrei Tarkovsky'],"['Anatoliy Solonitsyn', 'Ivan Lapikov', 'Nikolay Grinko']","['Andrey Konchalovskiy', 'Andrei Tarkovsky']"
Angel Has Fallen,Mike Banning is framed for the attempted assassination of the President and must evade his own agency and the FBI as he tries to uncover the real threat.,"After looking at my list for this year, there really aren&apos;t that many straight forward action films made anymore. But Angel Has Fallen came at the perfect time, end of August/early September when there&apos;s not much else out in theaters, at least blockbuster movie wise. While not better than the first entry &apos;Olympus Has Fallen&apos;, it is certainly superior to &apos;London Has Fallen&apos; from 2016, and it makes for a nice cap to the &apos;Has Fallen&apos; trilogy. That is, if this is the end to the series. And look, there&apos;s a ceiling to Gerard Butler&apos;s acting talent, but he&apos;s more than serviceable in a role like this and last year&apos;s Den of Thieves. Oh and Nick Nolte? He&apos;s so dang good in this movie it feels like he&apos;s on an entirely different level than everyone else. I&apos;m here for it.

Angels with Dirty Faces,A priest tries to stop a gangster from corrupting a group of street kids.,"Angels With Dirty Faces is a milestone film for the careers of both James Cagney and Pat O&apos;Brien. Up to now they had been successfully teamed by Warner Brothers in a whole series of buddy films. In fact it is my contention that they popularized that particular genre. Here they are childhood friends, but as adults, adversaries due to the course in life they took.

Cagney came off suspension from Warner Brothers and agreed to do this film as his comeback of sorts. At first glance it seems just like another gangster flick, just what Cagney had been trying to get away from. But by force of personality and a superior script, Cagney turned the role of Rocky Sullivan into a classic and got his first Academy Award nomination.

As for O&apos;Brien, this was his first clerical role. Usually O&apos;Brien is the fast talking manager, press agent,etc. When playing a priest Pat O&apos;Brien slows the pace of the dialog down to a crawl and it works. He greatly expanded his range here and there were many other classic clerical roles to come.

Cagney&apos;s a notorious gangster who&apos;s just been let out of prison after a three year stretch, taking a fall for his crooked attorney, Humphrey Bogart. Bogart was supposed to guard his $100,000.00 Cagney had squirreled away from illegal activities in the Twenties. Bogart&apos;s got a new partner now in George Bancroft and neither of them wants to cut Cagney in on anything.

Let&apos;s just say that Cagney in the usual Cagney fashion makes both of them wish they&apos;d played it on the square.

Father O&apos;Brien&apos;s concern is that notorious criminal Cagney is becoming a hero to some of the neighborhood kids in his parish. But he also can&apos;t forget that the two of them had been boyhood pals and that Cagney&apos;s first brush with the law was over a petty crime that O&apos;Brien was equally guilty of. This is shown in a small prologue with three players portraying, Cagney, O&apos;Brien, and neighborhood girl Ann Sheridan as kids.

Young Frankie Burke is astounding in his portrayal of the young Cagney. He has him down perfectly, he becomes Cagney. Angels With Dirty Faces is worth watching for him alone.

Those other juvenile actors with Warner Brothers at the time, The Dead End Kids, play the kids from the parish who come to idolize and idealize Cagney. O&apos;Brien has one tough time trying to make them see that Cagney&apos;s life is not the way to go in life.

Angels With Dirty Faces still has a powerful message for today and film aficionados should see it because of that and because it was a key turning point in the careers of James Cagney and Pat O&apos;Brien.",9,"['Crime', 'Drama', 'Film-Noir']","['juvenile delinquent', 'tough guy', 'catholic priest', 'reform school', 'electric chair']",1938-11-26,['Michael Curtiz'],"['James Cagney', 'Pat O&apos;Brien', 'Humphrey Bogart']","['John Wexley', 'Warren Duff', 'Rowland Brown']"
Animal Crackers,A family must use a magical box of Animal Crackers to save a run-down circus from being taken over by their evil uncle Horatio P. Huntington.,"REVIEW - ANIMAL CRACKERS

Why do I do it?

I try to keep abreast of the latest movies so I can review them and saw the write up for this so thought I&apos;d give it a try.

Ok I&apos;m not the target audience for this as I&apos;m 51 years old and not 6 but here goes.

Animated film and what attracted me to it was the sheer amount of stars doing the voice over for this include Danny Devito and Sylvester Stalone.

Actually quite good, kept me interested anyway, not really the humour for adults and there isn&apos;t really any dual humour, one joke for kids and one for adults that the kids won&apos;t understand but enjoyed it none the less.

Interesting story, set in modern times using mobile phones etc. Animation very good and a great way to waste 90 minutes with your kids who will just love this film.

Definitely a family sit around the TV movie.

There is definite chemistry between Allen and Keaton. That is one of the main reasons this movie is successful. Alvy and Annie do not have high wage jobs, they do not go clubbing, nor are they incredibly attractive. Why does a movie character relationship have to be so extreme it&apos;s unconvincing? These days movie producers create plots that are unbelievable. They don&apos;t have any depth and usually have shallow intentions. You can sense that the two leads care for each other. The situations in this movie resemble real life and that is why it is so critically acclaimed and remembered. Sure Woody talked into the camera, but that, in a sense is real life as well. It reminds me of my usual thought process and how when I think; I feel as though I&apos;m presenting my thoughts to myself. Only he is, presenting it to us.

US-French co-production from writer-director Claude Lelouch, who has keen eyes and stirs up an appropriately dusty, windswept scenario.

Antwone Fisher,,"It&apos;s Denzel Washington/s debut as a director, and his film does very well in exploring the moral dilemmas and redemption of his principal character, Antwone Fisher. Skirting the line between facts and fiction, he addresses the issues of pains, rage and aspirations of the young man. The film flows with a vividly soulful and engaging cinematic pace that is truly praiseworthy. There are many instances of sentimental exposes that viewers will find difficult to forget. The tale floats like an ordinary fare, but Denzel, the actor, keeps the story in motion as a priceless support to his refreshingly new protege actor, Derek Luke. Very cool performance! With every step he takes in the scenes, his presence commands the screen! Also, the heartfelt performance of the 28 year-old actor, Derek Duke, who plays the adult Antwone Fish&apos; Fisher, is equally awesome. This film does capture a journey that will keep the audience holding on to the belief that every human outcast can be saved, given the right guidance. A truly inspirational film that should be seen by all. 

The story is really formidable and the overall cast is formidably impressive. The theme of redemption is solidly and beautifully expressed through the interaction of the characters. The flashback reminders of the tyrannically abusive past of young Antwoine work well to help explain the rage, lack of confidence and misbehavior of Antwone Fisher. The on screen chemistry between Washington&apos;s Dr. Davenport and Luke&apos;s Antwone, and between Antwone and Joy Bryant&apos;s Cheryl is captivating. Novella Nelson&apos;s Mrs. Tate is certainly a terror to meet. I was also impressed by young Cory Hodges&apos; terrific performance. Overall, the cast presents their characters in a very believable manner. I find myself associating some of the characters with those from the writings of one of my favorite authors, James Baldwin. Unfortunately, with the exception of the Antwone, the D. Davenport and the Cheryl characters, many of the talented actors seem to ooze in and out of sight without solid positioning. I could sit and watch the melodrama of the last Thanksgiving scene over and over again. 

The flow of events set forth the pace of behavioral and mental development of Antwone. They may seemingly appear as events flatly thrown in as mere excuses to show Antoine&apos;s faults, but succeeds in giving reasons and offering solutions to the problems faced by the Antwone character. I love the way they are presented, almost in a hurried pace as if to raise spontaneous questions in the audience&apos;s minds as they analyze the young sailor&apos;s attitude! The film does portray a sense of emotional parallel between Antwone and Davenport, both waiting for the correct moments to burst out with their hidden deep-rooted emotions. That `poem-reading&apos; session is a definite highlight of the film. Derek Luke has a unique charismatic charm that will surely warm the hearts of many. 

This is great family film that expounds on the battle of a man `under a rock&apos; in his attempt to fight his internal demons. Yep, there are a lot of visual moments of traumatic pains and sufferings as there are many instances of emotional victories. And Mychaela Danna&apos;s music scores contribute wonderfully to the intensity of the moods of characters. Truly an inspirational film to watch!

Any Which Way You Can,"A trucker turned prize fighter, his brother and their pet orangutan have a series of misadventures involving the mob, corrupt cops, motorcycle gangs and pretty dames.","Clint Eastwood fans will correct me if I&apos;m wrong, but I believe hes only venture into screen&apos;comedy are Every Which Way But Locse and its successor film. This isn&apos;t the kind of stuff that Cary Grant would have been doing, but the two films do keep with Clint&apos;s macho screen image and allow him to slug a few people with some laughs in between.

Nearly all the characters from Any Which Way But Loose are back in this film Any Which Way You Can. Clint is once again Philo Beddoe who works part time hauling away wrecked cars, but makes his real money in the illegal bare knuckle prize fight racket. Clint lives in southern California, probably in a place not unlike Carmel, California where he was mayor. He lives with his mother Ruth Gordon, his partner in auto collision work Geoffrey Lewis and his pet orangutan, Clyde.

The last film ended with Clint not winning Sondra Locke, the country singer he lost his heart to. But Sondra&apos;s back now and when Clint wants to back out of a bare knuckle fight with reigning eastern champion William Smith because he&apos;s tired of the racket, the gangsters backing the fight kidnap her to force him to go through with it.

As in the last film, Clyde the orangutan gets the lion&apos;s share of the laughs. The sex life of the orangutan gets even more screen time, Clint and Geoff Lewis don&apos;t just find a zoo with a female orangutan in it for Clyde to mate with, they actually get him an adjoining motel room with Clyde and his lady love in one room and Clint and Sondra in another.

William Smith has the most interesting part in the film, usually he&apos;s a thoroughgoing bad guy in his films, but in Any Which Way You Can he&apos;s got a sense of honor and fair play, much to the distress of Harry Guardino and the rest of the gangsters backing the fight.

Any Which Way You Can has the same sense of rollicking lowbrow comedy that the first film has, maybe more so. As Clint Eastwood moves into his eighties maybe he&apos;ll try comedy again. He&apos;d be one great grumpy old man as he proved in Gran Torino.",6,"['Action', 'Comedy']","['sequel', 'machismo', 'vendetta', 'farce', 'abduction']",1980-12-17,['Buddy Van Horn'],"['Clint Eastwood', 'Sondra Locke', 'Geoffrey Lewis']","['Stanford Sherman', 'Jeremy Joe Kronsberg']"

Apollo 11,A look at the Apollo 11 mission to land on the moon led by commander Neil Armstrong and pilots Buzz Aldrin and Mike Collins.,"A half-century ago, Neil Armstrong stepped off the ladder of the Lunar Module Eagle and into the history books. In the decades since, that moment and the flights of NASA&apos;s Apollo program have been chronicled in seemingly countless documentaries. At the top of that list remains 1989&apos;s For All Mankind from the late Al Reinert and 2007&apos;s In The Shadow Of The Moon from British filmmakers David Sington and Christopher Riley. Up there with them now is 2019&apos;s Apollo 11, an exciting new film from Todd Douglas Miller that is begging for you to see it on the biggest screen possible.

Why?

In part because of Miller who, like those other great filmmakers of Apollo before him, wasn&apos;t content to merely do a rehash of what had come before. Miller&apos;s Apollo 11 is in part a deep dive into the NASA archives, uncovering things that even the most seasoned space enthusiast has likely never seen before. There&apos;s a wealth of pre-launch footage, for example, tracing the preparations from the rollout of the massive Saturn V rocket to the launch pad to multiple perspectives of the launch itself. Even when events move into space, there&apos;s still a wealth of rare material to experience including conversations between the astronauts themselves as well as between them and Mission Control in Houston. Even where footage that has become synonymous with the mission and the era such as the stage separations of the rocket or the Lunar Module&apos;s descent to the surface of the Moon, it&apos;s presented with clarity and scale rarely seen elsewhere. For that alone, the film renders excellent service.

It does so in other ways, as well. Unlike those two documentaries I mentioned at the top of this review, Miller doesn&apos;t use astronaut interviews (either aural or visual) to help tell the story. Instead, Apollo 11 unfolds entirely through archival sources ranging from the transmissions to the voice of NASA&apos;s public affairs or well-known TV commentators like Walter Cronkite. To help aid visually for parts of the mission where there isn&apos;t much or anything to show, the film employees simple animation alongside such commentaries. The film also makes effective use of split-screen and captions to portray mission control or to show events such as the actual walk on the Moon from multiple perspectives. As much as the footage itself on a cinema screen does, it presents the sheer scale of the endeavor but without losing the viewer in the technicalities involved in spaceflight.

In some ways, that&apos;s the greatest triumph of Apollo 11 the documentary. It&apos;s a film keen to present Apollo 11 the mission in awe-inspiring yet understandable terms, one that emphasizes how incredible in scope and achievement that flight five decades ago this July was. It&apos;s also a reminder, at a time when cinema screens find themselves increasingly dominated by would-be blockbusters and superhero flicks, of the raw power of cinema to present stories. Both of those are things we need reminding of, it seems, and the film does a superb job of both.",10,"['Documentary', 'History']","['apollo 11', 'astronaut', 'reference to michael collins the astronaut', 'electronic music score', 'buzz aldrin character']",2019-03-01,['Todd Douglas Miller'],"['Neil Armstrong', 'Mike Collins', 'Buzz Aldrin']",[]
The Apostle,"After his happy life spins out of control, a preacher from Texas changes his name, goes to Louisiana and starts preaching on the radio.","I didn&apos;t grow up down South, or even in the midwest, but I do know a little bit about the Pentacostal Church and Christian fundamentalism. Robert Duvall is an ambitious actor and film maker, and The Apostle hits home with its perceptive and loving portrayal of country people in the United States. It is refreshing to see that culture portrayed as something other than gaggles of yahoos. The Apostle focuses on the community spirit of the church, and thereby shatters some of the mystery of its appeal in a culture as self-centered as our own. There are no saints in this story, just a protagonist and his supporters trying to make sense of a country in which there is little love and way too much usury. The film is harsh on a number of levels, very no-nonsense though drawn out at various moments. But it&apos;s real, and that&apos;s more than can be said for ninety per cent of what passes for films about U.S. culture these days. It&apos;s said by some folks that Robert Duvall has been trying to make this film for a lot of years, and there are parts of The Apostle that contain faint echoes of his 1983 project Tender Mercies. It hardly matters, since both are interesting films for different reasons. Some day we&apos;ll see Robert Duvall as the vast repository of Americana he really is, until then, The Apostle is one of the best testimonies to his strengths that I know of.

I know the movie is about Bill Bixby and the kids but really, it&apos;s all about Conway and Knotts. They worked so well together that even if the rest of the movie was worthless, they made it incredible. If you watch the scenes with the two of them moving the ladder, you&apos;d swear that all of that was storyboarded and choreographed, but according to Conway on the special edition DVD, they improvised all of it. The bit with Knotts drinking out of the beer glass and Conway trying to get a drink out of too is some of the greatest schtick in movie history. This is a great movie with a great cast including Slim Pickens and Harry Morgan and some of the finest character actors of the day.

Plus two directors, prolific king of sleaze Joe D&apos;Amato (&apos;Antropophagus&apos;), and Steve Carver of &apos;Big Bad Mama&apos; and &apos;Drum&apos; fame. Unfortunately, the movie never really kick starts into high gear, and while entertaining enough, is a bit of a let down after the classic &apos;Black Mama, White Mama&apos;. Grier and Markov play slaves forced to serve the decadent Romans who make up the jaded audience of the local gladiator battles. It doesn&apos;t take a rocket scientist to guess that before too long the women will have to fight in the arena themselves, initially against male gladiators, but eventually their fellow female slaves. Will their individual will to survive win out over their burgeoning proto-feminist consciousness? I&apos;ll leave you to find that out... This is an above average 1970s drive in movie helped tremendously by the presence of Markov, and especially blaxploitation legend Grier, who is tough and sexy and shows quite a bit of flesh. The spirited cast also includes Jess Franco favourite Paul Muller (&apos;Vampyros Lesbos&apos;, &apos;A Virgin Among The Living Dead&apos;, Caiano&apos;s underrated &apos;Night Of The Doomed&apos;).

Armageddon,"After discovering that an asteroid the size of Texas will impact Earth in less than a month, NASA recruits a misfit team of deep-core drillers to save the planet.","...that&apos;s exactly what this is: an ACTION movie. It&apos;s not supposed to sweep the Oscars, the acting isn&apos;t supposed to be perfect, and it&apos;s not supposed to make perfect sense.

The story follows a group of oil drillers sent by NASA to stop an asteroid that will strike the world in eighteen days. The drillers are taught and trained to become astronauts (in a very comedic scene) and then sent to the asteroid to drop the nukes and blow it up. After that, a whole lot goes wrong.

I loved this movie, and I hate how everyone&apos;s been calling it &apos;mindless action&apos;. It&apos;s not mindless, it&apos;s actually very dramatic. The acting is great from pretty much all accounts, even Ben Affleck does a good job.

Bruce Willis captures the &apos;reluctant hero&apos; role, and Liv Tyler does well as his daughter. Steve Buscemi delivers a great comedic performance as the genius who goes insane once they land on the asteroid.

It was the first time I stumbled on a Hollywood film set, and I was excited to see the end result.

Though the film did make me laugh out loud at times, I was disappointed by this film. It concentrated too much on the comical mishaps along the journey. It made too little mention of how they travel from one place to another. It became a collection of funny clips shot in various places that are put together.

I was surprised by the number of big stars playing small parts: Arnold Schwarzenegger, Rob Schneider, Luke Wilson and Owen Wilson. Even Richard Branson was in it, which was a big little surprise.

Arthur,"Alcoholic billionaire playboy Arthur Bach must marry a woman he does not love, or he will be cut off from his $750,000,000 fortune.

By the end, it&apos;s clear that nobody other than Dudley Moore could have done it so well. Looking back, one remembers the sappy Christopher Cross theme song (does anyone remember Christopher Cross?) and oh-so-80&apos;s clothing and sets with an unavoidable nostalgia. But the triumvirate of Moore as Arthur, Liza Minnelli as Linda, and Sir Johnny G as the butler Hobson, dripping with sarcasm and at the pinnacle of his considerable talent, make this more than a throw-away farce.

All the best lines belong to Gielgud, and the Academy Award was hardly adequate for such a legendary performance. Moore&apos;s lovable drunk would wear thin in later years, but here it is a fresh and delightful tour de force in the most politically incorrect way. Liza is flawless, but one hates to see her in a non-musical role, for fear of squandering such an immense talent. But the chemistry, the synergy between these legends is palpable. 

 The laughs never get old.

Assault on Precinct 13,"A Highway Patrol Officer, two criminals and a station secretary defend a defunct Los Angeles precinct office against a siege by a bloodthirsty street gang.","Set in gang-riddled Los Angeles in the 1970s, director John Carpenter was inspired to make a film that was basically a combination of Rio Bravo (1959) and Night of the Living Dead (1968) with rookie cop Ethan Bishop in John Wayne&apos;s Rio Bravo role/Duane Jones&apos; Ben, a recently vacated police precinct as the small town jail/farmhouse, and with gang members in place of Night of the Living Dead&apos;s zombies/Nathan Burdette&apos;s men.

For some viewers, that premise alone may be enough for them to not be able to grant this film a 10, but Assault on Precinct 13 is yet another example of why quality isn&apos;t correlated to having unprecedented ideas.

One of the first striking things about Assault on Precinct 13 is that it looks beautiful. It was made on a relatively low budget, and it looks like a large percentage of the money must have gone into camera rental, film stock and film processing. Douglas Knapp&apos;s color cinematography is crisp, innovative (I just love the shot with the camera mounted in front of the car headlight, with the sunset in the background) and marvelously portrays Los Angeles as a gritty, suburban wasteland as well, if not better, than any other film I can think of. What makes it effective isn&apos;t over-the-top, run down buildings and heavily populated streets, but vast, wide-open spaces, with squat, nondescript houses and buildings, all fading into nothingness. Knapp even manages to make the streets look like this, and a couple scenes are set in what is effectively a sand-logged desert, with a lonely, dangerous phone booth sitting in isolation. The police station also reflects the suburban wasteland look in terms of its spaces and their relationship to each other, its sparseness and its colors.

The low budget nature of the film forced a very successful straightforward, brutal and realistic approach to the action, especially the violence. Carpenter, on his commentary track on the DVD, notes that some scenes weren&apos;t as he would have liked because they didn&apos;t have the coverage they needed, and had to let them play out, longer than normal, from a single angle. Thank the heavens for a lack of time and funding! Despite the over-the-top mayhem in subsequent action films by other directors, the impact of many of the scenes in this film cannot be topped, and it&apos;s often because of the unusual, almost documentary-like feel of the film.

Also adding to the effect is Carpenter&apos;s score. Although it&apos;s technically primitive, it&apos;s just as good as any of his other music, and Carpenter is as talented as a film composer as he is as a director. His use of motifs, often in an almost trance-like repetition, is similar too, and just as effective as, both Bernard Herrmann and Ennio Morricone.

The performances are all excellent, and the staging is even better. If you know anything about the premise of the film before you begin watching it for the first time, you may have difficulty figuring out how they&apos;re going to pull off the central situation of the film. The logistics seem to be against creating a prolonged tense situation. Carpenter and company create the perfect scenario with just a couple ingenious moves, and the unending threat, combined with the unusual pacing of the zombie-like menace make Assault on Precinct 13 as frightening as any horror film could be.",10,"['Action', 'Crime', 'Thriller']","['street gang', 'power outage', 'social decay', 'inner city', 'mauser c96 pistol']",1976-11-05,['John Carpenter'],"['Austin Stoker', 'Darwin Joston', 'Laurie Zimmer']",['John Carpenter']

Attack Force Z,,"Low-key WWII adventure film with noisy action , thrills , patriotic events and impressive battles . Moving warlike production set during WWII on the South Pacific at a location plenty of Japanese and a crew of New Zeeland soldiers battling an important base . As a group of Australian commandos launch a secret mission against Japanese forces in World War II. The brave commando is assigned a perilous mission on Chinese Islands already inhabited by stranded Japanese forces , they have some hours to get their objectives . The Americans are commanded by a Captain P.G. (Paul) Kelly (Mel Gibson) , along with Lieutenant J.A. (Jan) Veitch (John Phillip Law) , Sergeant D.J. (Danny) Costello (Sam Neill) ,Able Seaman A.D. &apos;Sparrer&apos; Bird (Chris Haywood) , Sub Lt. Ted &apos;Kingo&apos; King (John Waters) . At the beginning the soldiers successfully in wiping out Japanese and they endeavor to blow up a pivotal Japanese installation , but one of them early dies . Then they are spotted and descended upon by enemies forces ; meanwhile suffering casualties , exhaustion, dangerous encounters until execute their mission and to be rescued . They must go to the other side of the island to a beach , being really besieged by Japanese forces . Then , the daredevil captain and his underlings find themselves vying during the escape . The group must try to survive enemy that undergo a chase and a mini-war , as they fight all by themselves and finally find how wrong his misconceptions are .

A well known plot all before the end of WWII : an elite of corps of Australian military is Force Z volunteers are chosen for a risked mission . Australia/Taiwan Co-Production realised thru Roadshow Film, The Australian Film Commission and Umbrella Entertainment and written by Roger Marshall . Flag-waver , jingoist wartime movie with a typical crew of Anzacs battling the &apos;yellow menace&apos; and to find the aircraft that crashed somewhere and rescue a defecting government official on board . The film packs warlike action, thrills, drama and being quite entertaining . All the potentially thrilling set pieces are thrown away with a disregard for the basic mechanics of suspense and the climax is literally cardboard thin . The story contains a brief studio character seeking human frailty beneath surface heroism . Talented cast is partially wasted , being effectively directed in this limited budget adventure, featuring two young newcomers actors : Mel Gibson and Sam Neill , both of whom to have a long , long career . Splendid Mel Gibson , he is consistently watchable for the whole damned poor show with no much emotion ; however , appealing the WWII enthusiasts . Gibson plays as a tough captain , in one of his first roles when he starred early Australian successes such as : Tim , Chain reaction , Mad Max , Mad Max 2 , Beyond thunderdome , Gallipoli , The year of living dangerously , Mrs Soffel . A cool cast, nimble direction from Burstall with riveting climax and enhanced by energetic score make this a must for wartime hardcore fans, though it has some flaws , gaps and failures . The picture was filmed entirely on actual locations in Taiwan . The producers gratefully acknowledge the cooperation of the New Zeeland and Taiwan government and its armed Force . Thanksgiving to Department of Defense , New Zeeland Navy , Army Corps and Coast Guard , for their invaluable assistance .

This medium budget movie was professionally directed by Tim Burstall (1927-2004) . Director Burstall&apos;s skill with the thrills overcomes the artificiality of the story . He was a craftsman who made several TV series such as Return to Eden , Water Rats , Snowy River : The McGregor Saga , Special squad and films such as : Naked country , A Descant for Gossips , The Last of the Knucklemen , Duet for Four, Eliza Fraser , End Play , Getting Back to Nothing , Libido , Pesadilla en Bitter Creek , among others .

Others movies concerning the warfare sub-genre about Allied soldiers battling Japanese on the Pacific islands and Philippines during the WWII are the following ones : Guadalcanal diary (43) by Lewis Seiler with Anthony Quinn and Lloyd Nolan ; the classic Sands of Iwo Jima (1949) by Allan Dwan with John Wayne ; Beachhead (1956) by Stuart Heisler with Tony Curtis and Frank Lovejoy ; None but the brave, directed and starred by Frank Sinatra.

Attack the Block,A teen gang in South London defend their block from an alien invasion.,"I watched this without knowing the production team, who worked on it, nothing. A friend just said &apos;you like sci-fi movies right? Here.&apos; And I&apos;ll admit, for the first ten minutes, I was worried. The throw-back creature-feature title sequence being my main concern.

But after that wavery start, I watched over an hour of what I would consider to be one of the truest, bloodiest and certainly most adrenaline-packed horrors I&apos;ve seen in a very very long time.

The main kids - the &apos;gang&apos; - are very real and the kids&apos; acting really shines. Moses, the lead, certainly leads us through a series of complex emotions, from hatred to forgiveness, and round again a few more times just for kicks. The actor who played him will be going places with a sullen wall-eyed expression that he still manages to convey so much meaning with.

As to the plot - well, most of the actual plot is there for comedy, and the moment of gratuity when the adults are plainly dumber than the kids (teenagers everywhere punch the air and laugh). I was expecting, as I watched the film with ever more pleasure, to be let down and have the aliens&apos; presence left unexplained, as with many non-blockbuster horrors. But, in two mere sentences, the loose threads are tied and the finale is lead into all in one great sweep of fantastic writing.

Last, but definitely not least, the aliens themselves were phenomenal. There was a certain amount of keep-them-in-the-dark and leave-it-to-your-imagination, but there were also absolute gore-fest moments which were done superbly (though the squeamish may need to blink). The aliens were well designed and were flawlessly integrated into the movie. To be honest I don&apos;t even know if they were puppets or CGI - I was so caught up in the fast-paced running and fighting, into which they were so seamlessly included.

Definitely one to watch for fans of the genre, fans of the creators, or anyone looking for a thrill. I&apos;ll certainly be watching it again.

Australia,"Set in northern Australia before WWII, an Englishwoman who inherits a sprawling ranch reluctantly pacts with a stock-man in order to drive 2,000 head of cattle over unforgiving landscapes.","This film struggled throughout its epic length to stay upright. Unfortunately at the end it stumbled and fell like a pile of bricks.

It tried to juggle so much but in the end, it all turned out to be too little. The film starts like a corny slapstick comedy, turns into a romantic fantasy, then into an outback adventure, then into a war movie, a heartfelt drama, a comment on the stolen generation, a comment on racism... etc, etc. It&apos;s just too much. Yes, it&apos;s supposed to be an epic, but things like this need to be handled with finesse. Unfortunately, it isn&apos;t in this case. The themes were too muddled, the script too stretched - it&apos;s a mess. The characters are cardboard cutouts, the acting is over the top and cheesy, the pacing is off, the bizarre use of Somewhere Over the Rainbow... It&apos;s just a broken film.

Being an Australian, I did hope that this movie would be alright, but it turned out to be almost 3 hours of wankery that disgracefully cost our taxpayers over $40m.

On a more positive note, on the whole it wasn&apos;t BORING, and it was aesthetically and aurally pleasing - even though it made use of countless, shameless green screen shots which were simply unnecessary.

There was ONE great scene in the film, and that&apos;s when Hugh Jackman and his Aboriginal friend enter the ruined pub. That was absolutely excellent.

Avalanche,The vacationers at a winter wonderland struggle to survive after an avalanche of snow crashes into their ski resort. Their holiday then turns into a game of survival.,"I&apos;m not a fan of the disaster genre, they&apos;re always the same. 


* Introduction of characters
* Expert warns people of imminent disaster
* Powers that be ignore expert
* Disaster happens
* Then either a lot of running and talking about what is happening until it ends or some pseudo science to fix it


This is no different and what&apos;s strange is just how little of the film the disaster takes up.

Starring Robert Forster, Rock Hudson and Mia Farrow this is more like a soap opera where an avalanche just so happens to take place.

Swinging 70&apos;s, polystyrene snow and merciless deaths this has it&apos;s merits but certainly pales in comparison to the better films within this sub genre.

Cast do a decent job

Baby Face,"A young woman, sexually exploited all her life, decides to turn the tables and exploit the hapless men at a big city bank - by gleefully seducing her way to the top.","Arriving by boxcar in New York City, the shrewd young woman with the BABY FACE begins to methodically canoodle her way to the top floors of power in a great bank.

Barbara Stanwyck is fascinating as the amoral heroine of this influential pre-Code drama. Without a shred of decency or regret, she coolly manipulates the removal or destruction of the men unlucky enough to find themselves in her way. A wonderful actress, Stanwyck has full opportunity here to display her ample talents.

Appearing quite late in the story, George Brent is a welcome addition as the one fellow possibly able to handle Stanwyck; his sophisticated style of acting makes a nice counterpoint to her icy demeanor. Douglas Dumbrille, Donald Cook & Henry Kolker portray a succession of her unfortunate victims.

John Wayne appears for just a few scant seconds as an unsuccessful suitor for Stanwyck&apos;s affections. This would be the only time these two performers appeared together on screen.

Movie mavens should recognize Nat Pendleton as a speakeasy customer, and Charles Sellon & Edward Van Sloan as bank executives - all unbilled.

The music heard on the soundtrack throughout the film, perfectly punctuating the plot, is Baby Face&apos; (1926) by Benny Davis & Harry Akst and St. Louis Blues&apos; (1914) by W.C. Handy.

BABY FACE is a prime example of pre-Code naughtiness. In its frank & unapologetic dealing with sex, it is precisely the kind of film which the implementation of the Production Code in 1934 was meant to eliminate.",10,"['Drama', 'Romance']","['cult film', 'national film registry', 'looking out a window', 'black american', 'african american']",1933-11-17,['Alfred E.

The Bad and the Beautiful,"An unscrupulous movie producer uses an actress, a director and a writer to achieve success.","Producer Jonathan Shields is in big trouble on a production and reaches out to three people he&apos;s befriended and betrayed in the past for help. All three are brought to Harry Pebbel&apos;s office where he makes a pitch for the help of each one. And we&apos;re told in flashback the dynamics of the relationships between Shields and each one.

One thing about Tinseltown, they&apos;ve never been afraid to show the seamier side of movie-making. Kirk Douglas&apos;s Jonathan Shields is a not too thinly disguised version of David O. Selznick. The same drive, the same ambition, the same overwhelming ego that Selznick was legendary for is a part that was tailor made for Kirk Douglas.

The three betrayed people, director Fred Amiel(Barry Sullivan), star Georgia Lorrison(Lana Turner), and screenwriter James Lee Barlow(Dick Powell)all ring very true. One of the things I like about this film is that all three stories, each in itself, could be expanded into a film all it&apos;s own. 

Lana Turner&apos;s role as the ersatz Diana Barrymore is not to hard to spot either. It&apos;s so much better here than the film based on her own book Too Much Too Soon. If that voice of Turner&apos;s actor father on those 78 rpms she&apos;s playing sounds familiar, it&apos;s that of Louis Calhern. Turner&apos;s was a life lived out all too well in the tabloids and she brings all of it to bear in playing Gerogia Lorrison.

Dick Powell, who was offered the lead as Jonathan Shields, opted to play tweedy professor turned screenwriter James Lee Barlow. This was Powell&apos;s next to last feature picture as an actor, it should have been the one he went out on. Powell was always ahead of the industry&apos;s cutting edge and he decided to concentrate more on directing and acting for the small screen.

Powell&apos;s segment includes Gloria Grahame as his flirty wife. Post World War II Hollywood, whenever it had a part for a tramp, first call Gloria Grahame. Here she responds with an Academy Award winning performance. She hasn&apos;t many scenes, but as was said in another MGM picture around that time, what there is is cherce.

I don&apos;t think there&apos;s ever been an actor who can go from zero to sixty on the emotional scale as quickly as Kirk Douglas. Check the scene when Lana Turner discovers how Douglas betrayed her. The intensity of his reaction alone is frightening and real. Douglas was also up for an Oscar, but it went that year to laconic Gary Cooper in High Noon.

Anyways this movie is very good and very underrated. It&apos;s strait forward horror it doesn&apos;t try to be anything else. It&apos;s short only 74 minutes I think and that a good thing because movies like this shouldn&apos;t be long. This is a straightforward horror film and its great for what it is. The end when he&apos;s changing in the woods was very suspenseful and when the surveyor bites it that was just awesome. Another good thing about this movie is the werewolf itself it&apos;s a great looking werewolf even though it&apos;s obviously animatronics but still badass and scary looking especially the eyes.

One bad thing is the crappy CG transformation it was laughably bad.

The film garnered two sequels, a television series, and a 2005 remake. It also received multiple award nominations.

This time juvenile delinquent Jackie Earle Haley and his teammates hit the road to Houston to play a little league game in the Astrodome. It seems that Haley&apos;s estranged father (William Devane) also lives in Texas and he becomes a focal point as the club lacks a manager. The kids are more grown up this time but their maturity seems to be on the decline as they only care about girls (who are all obviously older than they are) and getting into general mischief. The only real attraction is the Astrodome as the old scoreboard and the novelty of the eighth wonder of the world in 1977 make the closing act of the picture a nostalgic view to a part of sports history that many have already forgotten about.

I believe this film was nominated because it demonstrates simplicity of story-telling with a charming and identifiable lead character.

The Bandit of Sherwood Forest,"The adventures of Robert of Nottingham, the son of Robin Hood.","Columbia Pictures reportedly spent about $1 million on this fairly robust entertainment, chronicling the adventures of Robert of Huntington (American star Cornel Wilde), the son of the legendary Robin Hood (Russell Hicks). It&apos;s 20 years since Hood Sr.&apos;s adventures, and there&apos;s a new tyrant to deal with, the nefarious William of Pembroke (ever-reliable Henry Daniell). This piece of work wants to murder the current boy-king (Maurice Tauzin) and become king himself. But Robin still associates with his legendary Merrie-Men, and is soon joined by Robert, who&apos;s just as adept at handling swords and bows & arrows.

A first-rate cast (Jill Esmond as the queen, Anita Louise as Roberts&apos; love interest Lady Catherine, Edgar Buchanan as Friar Tuck, George Macready as Fitz-Herbert, Ray Teal as Little John, etc.) helps to make this very pleasant if nothing altogether special. While there is enough violence on hand, very little of it is actually bloody, and the action is well-executed. The music is by Hugo Friedhofer, who&apos;d worked on the very popular Errol Flynn Robin Hood movie, and it&apos;s appropriately rousing. The athletic and charismatic Wilde is a fine choice for the dashing lead, who has a sense of humour and a very confident attitude. Daniell is, as always, a perfect movie villain. You only have to know him briefly to know that he&apos;s pure evil. But what really makes the difference is the fact that Columbia shot this in Technicolor, which gives the adventure a degree of freshness. Some of the colours just pop off the screen.

Screenplay credited to Wilfrid H. Pettitt & Melvin Levy, based on a story by Paul A. Castleton & Pettitt and a novel by Castleton. Henry Levin and George Sherman share director credit, but maintain an effective unity of vision.

Baraka,A collection of expertly photographed scenes of human life and religion.,"&apos;Baraka&apos; is a work of art which rates amongst the greatest achievements in the field. As with any masterwork, it is something one will have to pursue. For those that seek it out at the proper time, &apos;Baraka&apos; can act as a milestone of revelation. What the viewer takes from this film will solely be determined by the life experience they bring to it. &apos;Baraka&apos; is unique in that it actually requires a commitment of time and concentration. This is a film that communicates its message without utilizing standard film language. Those that try to make the images conform to the conventional notions of Hollywood story telling are likely to give up in frustration. For a film with no plot,characters or dialog, it communicates an astonishing number of profound themes. Those who are familiar with National Geographic or the works of David Attenbourough will have little trouble in identifying the fascinating locals and tribes, but be forewarned: there are reasons that there are no subtitles or text on screen. Personal discovery is at the heart of the filmmaker&apos;s intentions. The ambient soundtrack by Michael Sterns weaves the images together on a separate plain, producing a hypnotic pathway for the images to flow. Once you allow yourself to be pulled along by this current of sound the images will link themselves together and the true revelations hidden within &apos;Baraka&apos; will make themselves apparent. You may find as I did that your subconscious will be at work on &apos;Baraka&apos; for many weeks after the experience, unlocking doors to a greater understanding.",10,['Documentary'],"['human nature', 'environmental education', 'world culture', 'no dialogue', 'fast motion scene']",1993-11-19,['Ron Fricke'],['Patrick Disanto'],"['Ron Fricke', 'Mark Magidson', 'Genevieve Nicholas']"

Well it&apos;s more difficult to make a simple artistic film than making a complex piece of art & its Simplicity & portrayal of natural emotions in his films which is striking the right chords. Silence of the girl is the most felt part of the film. And what a poetic end- the last foot print impression of the girl in his life, that even rain can&apos;t wash it away.

Barbarella,"Barbarella, an astronaut from the 41st century, sets out to find and stop the evil scientist Durand Durand, whose Positronic Ray threatens to bring evil back into the galaxy.","Comic Strip brought appropriately to life . Tremendous fun, amusing scenes , psychedelic frames and many other things . In the far future, the year is 40,000. The protagonist is a highly sexual woman named Barbarella (Jane Fonda , Sophia Loren turned down the title role) is tasked with finding and stopping the evil Durand-Durand (character famously inspired the band name of 1980s pop stars Duran Duran), a missing scientist (Milo O&apos;Shea). Along the quite sexy way she encounters various unusual people . As Barbarella (whose costume was inspired by designer Paco Rabanne) travels to the evil city called SoGo, it is a reference to Biblical cities Sodom and Gomorrah. On her dangerous trip she teams with blind angel Pygar (John Philip Law), and fights the Great Tyrant (Anita Pallenberg) along with numerous sexual torture devices , but she has to save the world .

Naif Sci-Fi plenty of colors , thrills , brilliant cinematography by Claude Renoir and fantastic images ; surprisingly, for such a diverse melange, it actually works. Knowingly Camp version of comic-book sci-Fi classic written by Jean Claude Forest . In the original comic, Barbarella was not a secret agent but an outlaw, and the movie omits some of the adventures she had on Lythion, including an encounter with an earlier villainess called the Gorgon, whose face changed into a duplicate of the face of anyone who looked at her. Unlike the other space movies of the time, this film emphasized sets and costumes rather than visual effects, and as a result its overall look dates less than many space operas of the late seventies/early eighties .Jane Fonda is simply unbelievable as gorgeous heroine , she plays a feisty Barbarella , a futuristic girl from Earth . The scenes during the opening credits where Barbarella seems to float around her spaceship were filmed by having Jane Fonda lie on a huge piece of plexiglas with a picture of the spaceship underneath her. It was then filmed from above, creating the illusion that she is in zero gravity. Performance-wise, everyone seems to be camping it up like an end-of-term pantomime, though Milo O&apos;Shea somehow seems to give his villain a deliciously style . Barbarella was the first science fiction hero from the comics to be adapted into a feature film as opposed to a serial , Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers, her male predecessors, had only appeared in serials up to this point. A bit later on , there was realized by Mike Hodges ¨Flash Gordon¨ (1980) in similar aesthetic and a TV series titled ¨Buck Rogers¨ . Jolly and catching musical score , including commercial songs , by Charles Fox, who co-wrote the songs for this film, also wrote the theme song for another Sci/Fi flick of 1968, The Green Slime, and future Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour was one of the session musicians who performed the film&apos;s original score. The motion picture was originally directed by Roger Vadim who married Brigitte Bardot , in fact , the original author Jean-Claude Forest based the character of Barbarella on Brigitte Bardot - who ironically was director Roger Vadim&apos;s previous wife ; Vadim subsequently married Jane Fonda .

There are just too many funny things in this movie to mention them all, so I won&apos;t mention any. But this is a movie that is going to stand up to the test of time; it may be the Coen brothers&apos; best movie, because it is both dead funny and dead serious.

Turturro gives the performance of a lifetime as Barton, and Goodman proved with this movie that he was a first class acting talent (what made the Coens think of him in this role, anyway? surely a mark of genius).

Basket Case,"A young man carrying a big basket that contains his extremely deformed, formerly conjoined twin brother seeks vengeance on the doctors who separated them against their will.","Basket Case (1982) happens to be one of the greatest shoe string budget horror films ever made. A true cult classic and a tragic tale of brotherly love and jealousy. The sleazy surroundings and characters that the movie was shot in and around adds to it&apos;s charm. Duane and Belial are a pair of brothers you don&apos;t want to cross paths with. This film was such a success that it spawned two sequels and a funny cameo in another. Highly recommended.

The studios took a big chance and allowed a young Tim Burton to take on their biggest asset and he made a movie like no other directer could. Along with Christopher Reeve as Superman, Michael Keaton will always be my top choice for the role as he plays the haunted and lost Bruce Wayne so fantastically well that I doubt it will ever be bettered.

Batman Returns,"While Batman deals with a deformed man calling himself the Penguin wreaking havoc across Gotham with the help of a cruel businessman, a female employee of the latter becomes the Catwoman with her own vendetta.","Very rarely do movie sequels ever match the grandeur of the originals. BATMAN RETURNS however, does so with gusto. The sequel to 1989&apos;s BATMAN, BATMAN RETURNS neither milks the success of the first movie nor totally disregards it; it&apos;s a wonderful sequel and a spectacular movie in its own right. There&apos;s something for everyone in this movie - humor, high drama, plenty of action, and lots of cool things to look at. Of course, viewers have to get around Tim Burton&apos;s morbid and sometimes offensive sense of humor, but that shouldn&apos;t be too much of a problem in this era of SOUTH PARK and THERE&apos;S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY. While the movie has many great moments, it also has its flaws. The plot seems rushed, stitched together. Danny DeVito tries his best as the Penguin but doesn&apos;t quite pull it off. Christopher Walken appears as a secondary bad guy, but his performance is lackluster compared to the others. And many of the action sequences, though breathtaking, seemed forced and are occasionally absurd. All that aside, there&apos;s all kinds of surprises in this movie - smart humor and dialogue, characters you can&apos;t help but love, lots of satire (Homer&apos;s Iliad, CITIZEN KANE, and the American political scene are all lampooned), and many memorable scenes that only serve as a testament to Burton&apos;s colorful imagination. I hope to get this movie on DVD, where I can enjoy it on my big screen TV in all its glory. Not exactly the best Batman film ever, but still a fascinating movie to watch over and over again.",,"['Action', 'Crime', 'Fantasy']","['penguin', 'dc comics', 'alfred pennyworth character', 'superhero', 'mask']",1992-06-19,['Tim Burton'],"['Michael Keaton', 'Danny DeVito', 'Michelle Pfeiffer']","['Bob Kane', 'Daniel Waters', 'Sam Hamm']"

The Battle of Elderbush Gulch,The fact that an Indian tribe is eating puppies starts an action-packed battle in a Western town.,"Two girls (one is played by Mae Marsh) move in with their uncle. Nearby, and Indian tribe has just concluded their dog-eating festival. The Indian Chief&apos;s son (an unrecognizable Henry B. Walthall) arrives too late for the feast and is angry. Now the girls just happen to have two puppies. Now the puppies just happen to escape from the girls. Now Walthall just happens to spot his potential meal. Now Marsh goes looking for the puppies and accosts Walthall. Now Marsh&apos;s uncle just happens to be looking for Marsh and shoots Walthall. Now the rest of the tribe is angry and decides to attack the town, leading to a well staged gunfight which is resolved once the soldiers arrive.

Lillian Gish plays the mother of a newborn, and she and her husband (Robert Harron) have just arrived in town. Gish gives the best acting performance as she almost has a nervous breakdown trying to find her baby once the shooting starts.

In one very creepy scene, during the attack, we see a gun being pointed down at Gish, but it is eventually withdrawn. I assumed this scene was meant to illustrate that being shot would be preferable to whatever these Indians would do to you. There is a scene similar to this in Birth of a Nation, but don&apos;t think this is just some thing of D.W. Griffith&apos;s. In Stagecoach, a 1939 John Ford film, the same scene is played out.

Many of the cast members were reunited for The Birth of a Nation. Harry Carey is supposed to be in this, but I couldn&apos;t spot him. I did spot Lionel Barrymore as a soldier, and he certainly has a great physique here at age 34. Recommended as a good piece of silent drama, and I usually don&apos;t even like westerns.",7,"['Short', 'Action', 'Western']","['survival', 'cavalry', 'melodrama', 'native american']",,['D.W.

Interno di un convento,"On the surface the women at the convent are your average nuns. However, what they get up to in their spare time is far from what you&apos;d expect from nuns.","What supposedly goes on &apos;behind convent walls&apos; is the subject matter of pretty much every nunsploitation film ever made, and this film is director Walerian Borowczyk&apos;s take on the theme. Given that he previously directed The Beast; I have to say that I was expecting something a little stranger from the director, and while the film does have some quirks not seen in other nunsploitation efforts; it has to be said that it&apos;s pretty much a textbook entry and that is really the most disappointing thing about it. As ever, its sex, Satanism and general sinning that is the order of the day; although the film does not really follow a set narrative. The film is apparently based on a novel by someone called &apos;Stendhal&apos; and focuses on a convent, where most of the nuns are beautiful and like to do everything except what nuns are supposed to do (despite having seen so many films about nuns, I actually don&apos;t know what that is!). Basically, what we get is the leaders of the convent trying to instill proper values in the nuns, while the nuns ignore them.

This genre is best known for its hardcore entries by directors such as Joe D&apos;Amato, but this one is actually surprisingly soft. The director delights in showing the nuns half dressed; we get plenty of shots of naked women wearing the nun&apos;s headgear and while it could be considered blasphemous, it&apos;s not particularly offensive. The most noteworthy scene of the movie goes against the flow a little bit and sees a nun pleasuring herself with a carving featuring the face of Jesus! Outside of that, however, the film doesn&apos;t feature the hardcore atrocities that Joe D&apos;Amato delights in filming. The plot is really unimportant and it soon becomes apparent that the film is only going to be an excuse to show what (or rather, what probably doesn&apos;t) go on behind convent walls. The women are all rather beautiful and the cinematography is too which ensures that the film is at least nice to look at. Overall, I don&apos;t think this film will do a lot for those wanting hardcore pornography from their nunsploitation; but it&apos;s a decent film and provides enough for the average nunsploitation fan.",6,"['Drama', 'Romance']","['nunsploitation', 'male rear nudity', 'low budget film', 'based on novel', 'grindhouse film']",1978-01-26,['Walerian Borowczyk'],"['Ligia Branice', 'Howard Ross', 'Marina Pierro']","['Walerian Borowczyk', 'Stendhal']"

The Perks of Being a Wallflower,An introvert freshman is taken under the wings of two seniors who welcome him to the real world.,"The Perks of Being a Wallflower is another story about a simple guy living in a cruel life of high school. The difference is he&apos;s not ought to save the day, wants to lose his virginity, seeking to be popular, or revenge on his bullies. The story is about a shy kid who wants to get along with people and can&apos;t wait to leave high school. Behind it is the genuine pain and emotion of the characters which makes it more than just another story about teenagers. Stephen Chbosky tells his own story on screen pretty well and the performances are quite excellent. The Perks of Being a Wallflower is often heartbreaking, charming, and wonderful.

Charlie is palpably just another teenage protagonist, but he is not one of those who tries to prove everyone who mistreated him wrong. His goal is to get away from being anti-social and be like anyone else in high school. We may have heard a story like this before, but what makes this one extraordinary is when it mostly depicts the darkest aspects of their lives. Expressing the most heartbreaking truths about these teenagers. Knowing their problems easily makes it reasonable for us to care about them. The romance is rather credibly lovely than a mainstream claptrap. In the joyous moments, it&apos;s pretty delightful and plays a quite nostalgic soundtrack.

The film gives the actors some nuance. This is probably a good thing for Logan Lerman. He usually plays the simple charming guy in movies. Since he&apos;s good at those, he adds some credibility to Charlie. Emma Watson is likable enough as Sam. The best among the three is Ezra Miller. One might hams it up for Patrick, but Miller gave the character a genuinely wonderful personality.

The director and author, Stephen Chbosky, didn&apos;t try anything else than to bring his book to life. He tells it straightforward on screen with plenty of strong, effective emotions. The cinematography is bright and beautiful enough. The tunnel scene has the best shots. While the soundtrack is too conspicuous, the music score is noticeably melancholic.

The Perks of Being a Wallflower is best if you can actually relate to the lead character or have experienced the struggles of being an adolescent. When it&apos;s not depressing, the film goes to those blissful moments that make us remember the good times in high school. Overall, it&apos;s a great film. It&apos;s a film adaptation that replaces the cliché mainstream swagger with some painful realities and simply let the audience understand the whole point of it. In the end, it&apos;s quite a remarkable film.",10,['Drama'],"['coming of age', 'high school', 'first love', 'introvert', 'gay']",2012-10-12,['Stephen Chbosky'],"['Logan Lerman', 'Emma Watson', 'Ezra Miller']",['Stephen Chbosky']
Being John Malkovich,A puppeteer discovers a portal that leads literally into the head of movie star John Malkovich.,"Unemployed puppeteer Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) and animal lover Lotte Schwartz (Cameron Diaz) are in a loveless marriage.

Maxine decides to sell tickets at $200 a pop. Lotte is completely changed by the experience and thinks she&apos;s a transsexual. Craig&apos;s boss Dr. Lester is obsessed with Malkovich.

This is one of the strangest and most compelling ideas ever put on the screen written by Charlie Kaufman and directed by Spike Jonze. It is exciting that everything and everyone is a little off in this movie. Cameron Diaz is ugly. John Cusack is disheveled. Catherine Keener is a sex goddess. The whole movie is off its axis and so much the better for it.

Bela Lugosi Meets a Brooklyn Gorilla,Two goofy entertainers meet a mad scientist on a jungle island.,"BELA LUGOSI MEETS A BROOKLYN GORILLA (3 outta 5 stars) Okay, this is a lousy movie... but it still entertained the heck out of me. It&apos;s so unbelievably bad that you cannot take your eyes away for a second lest you miss something. Duke Mitchell and Sammy Petrillo star as... Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis. Well, it was probably meant more as a rip-off than an homage... but why quibble? Duke Mitchell is a dreadful singer and he hardly even looks like Dean Martin... they could have dragged anyone in off the street and given him that haircut and they&apos;d have been just as good. Petrillo, on the other hand, is a dead-on ringer for a young, lean Jerry Lewis (whether this is good or bad news depends on your tolerance for Jerry Lewis). Bela Lugosi co-stars as a creepy mad doctor who turns people into gorillas.. or whatever. (Don&apos;t expect the story to make any sense.) Really, this movie isn&apos;t any worse than a lot of those classic buddy comedy movies of the era. The jokes are corny, the plot is silly and there are totally unnecessary musical and romantic subplots.

Bella,A chef with a mysterious past spends the day with a waitress who needs a friend.,"Having heard that this film won at Toronto, I was anxious to see it. Although it has not yet been widely released, I was fortunate to attend at a recent sneak preview and found it to be incredibly refreshing and subtly powerful. Stylistically, newcomer director Alejandro Monteverde does a superb job pacing the story -- combining just the right amounts of character, humor, and mystery into a package that satisfies on multiple levels -- intellectually, visually, emotionally, symbolically, etc. The photography -- shot in and around the streets of Manhattan and Long Island -- is top notch, reminding me of James Crabe&apos;s amazing cinematography along the streets of Philadelphia in Rocky (1977)....and the editing, relying heavily on jump cuts, keeps the story moving along in multiple time frames to great effect.

The actors all shine in their roles, particularly Mexican superstar Eduardo Verástegui and Tammy Blanchard, who portray their particularly complex relationship -- between a cook and a waitress in a Mexican restaurant -- with finesse. Additionally, the filmmakers do an excellent job presenting Hispanic culture in a manner that shatters the ridiculous stereotypes that are often presented in mainstream television and film. The scenes taking place at the cook&apos;s Hispanic parents&apos; house are particularly funny, charming, and poignant. Also, the film portrays some very powerful emotional moments that have tremendous staying power long after leaving the theater.

In short, this is subtly powerful film that everyone should see.",9,"['Drama', 'Romance']","['character name as title', 'forename as title', 'reference to abortion', 'reference to adoption', 'young man with beard']",2007-11-30,['Alejandro Monteverde'],"['Eduardo Verástegui', 'Tammy Blanchard', 'Manny Perez']","['Alejandro Monteverde', 'Patrick Million', 'Leo Severino']"

Beneath the Planet of the Apes,The sole survivor of an interplanetary rescue mission searches for the only survivor of the previous expedition. He discovers a planet ruled by apes and an underground city run by telepathic humans.,"Beneath the Planet of the Apes (1970) is a movie I recently watched for the first time in a long time on HBOMAX. The storyline follows another spaceship that was sent into the atmosphere to retrieve the passengers of the spacecraft from the first film when Earth lost track of it. Their ship crashes on the same planet as the ship from the first film and the lone survivor will face many of the same pitfalls as the first crew. He hunts down the main character from the first film in hopes of rescuing him and working together.

This movie is directed by Ted Post (Hang em High) and stars James Franciscus (Good Guys Wear Black), Linda Harrison (Planet of the Apes), Kim Hunter (A Streetcar Named Desire), Charlton Heston (Ten Commandments) and Maurice Evans (The Jerk).

This movie recycled so many elements of the first film, even casting a guy who looked like Heston and making him do virtually the same things. The underground civilization was a nice touch, though I am not sure I loved the mind control human plot. I will say the mask off moments were fantastic and contains great makeup, masks and special effects. The ending was solid but a step down from the first picture.

Overall this is an okay sequel that is a huge stepdown from the original. I would score this a 6-6.5/10.",6,"['Action', 'Adventure', 'Sci-Fi']","['ape', 'planet of the apes', 'planet', 'astronaut', 'rescue']",1970-05-26,['Ted Post'],"['James Franciscus', 'Kim Hunter', 'Maurice Evans']","['Paul Dehn', 'Mort Abrahams', 'Pierre Boulle']"

In particular, I liked Kennedy as the slimy guy you know MUST go bad before the picture is complete. Rock Hudson is fine, though not especially distinguished in his supporting role. On top of these two excellent performances, the writing is stellar, as the story is far from the typical production. It takes a lot of twists and turns and keeps your attention throughout.

Better Watch Out,"On a quiet suburban street, a babysitter must defend a twelve-year-old boy from intruders, only to discover it&apos;s far from a normal home invasion.","Let me give you some advice: the second that you finish reading this review, get off imdb.com, steer clear of any ratings or stories about this movie, don&apos;t watch any trailers, and don&apos;t ask anyone about it. Just find the movie, and watch it. Go in with a totally clean slate and enjoy. 

 I don&apos;t really want to say much more than that out of fear of ruining any element of the movie.

I don&apos;t want to describe why they&apos;re great because that could give something away. Just know that they&apos;re superb. 

 Plot-wise, the most I can say is that an attractive female babysitter comes over to watch a junior high school boy while his parents go out for the night. After that, visitors arrive and stuff happens. Lots of stuff.

The Place Beyond the Pines,A motorcycle stunt-rider turns to robbing banks as a way to provide for his lover and their newborn--a decision that sets him on a collision course with an ambitious rookie cop navigating a department ruled by a corrupt detective.,"I had no idea what to expect from this, but I&apos;d seen and liked Ryan Gosling in DRIVE so I thought I&apos;d give it a go. And the director has clearly been taking a few pointers from that film, because stylistically it&apos;s very similar: slow paced, scenes shot the same way, the same type of music. Hell, even Gosling is playing a similar character, a guy who best communicates through violent action.

The first hour of this film is fantastic: gripping, edge-of-the-seat stuff, with another excellent performance from the star. Then things go in a different direction for the second hour, with the less-interesting Bradley Cooper becoming the focus of the story. This part&apos;s still pretty good, if more familiar. It all rounds out again with a third act which ups the suspense to a satisfying climax.

THE PLACE BEYOND THE PINES is an actor&apos;s film, and indeed there are some great performances here: Gosling, an almost unrecognisable Eva Mendes, Ben Mendelsohn, and Dane DeHaan all give very good performances, and it&apos;s a treat to see Harris Yulin (SCARFACE) on the screen again. But the technical values and the mature script easily match the calibre of the acting, making this an all-round winner.

First of all can, you imagine a movie with such a cast. Heston, Peck, Ives, Bickford, Connor, Baker, and Jean Simmons ( one of my favorite actors ). Throw in the scenery, the incredible musical score, and a plot with romance, and minimal violence, and you have a classic. On a home widescreen with the volume high, I am sure even compared to todays movies it is entertaining and ageless. As a footnote, I saw this movie years ago and it stuck in my mind. One day while listening to CBC radio on a call in request segment someone called in and asked for the theme from Big Country. It stirred me to track down a copy of the movie. I also like the story about Heston thinking of turning it down ( An Actor&apos;s Life ) since his part was secondary. His agent said are you nuts to turn down Willy Wyler.

The Big Parade,A young American soldier witnesses the horrors of the Great War.,"One of the great films of all time. John Gilbert stars as a callow lad from a wealthy family who joins up at the start of World War I. The film follows him through his early days in the army, his days in rural France, and then his time at the front, and finally his return home.

King Vidor directs this amazing film, one of the best war films ever made, with touches of humor and irony, but never losing sight of the horrors and stupidity of war.

John Gilbert would have won the Oscar for 1925 if the awards had started then. He&apos;s simply superb as Jack. You watch his eyes as this films goes on. In the beginning his eyes twinkle with glee and delight as he makes friends, finds love, and grows into manhood. Then his eyes change and go dead as he experiences war. This is one of the great silent film performances.

But the film also boasts great work from Renee Adoree as Melisande and Karl Dane as the Swede. Co-stars are Tom O&apos;Brien as Bull, Hobart Bosworth and Claire McDowell as the parents.

The TCM copy I have has a incredible score by Carl Davis. There is one scene when Gilbert is off to the front and he can&apos;t find Adoree. The music is a discordant mishmash of previously heard tunes, and the music grows louder and louder until they find each other. The scene that follows is heartbreaking and unforgettable.

But this film is full of great scenes, including the one where Gilbert teaches Adoree to chew gum. So simple yet so charming. Then there&apos;s the shower scene where Gilbert has gotten a wine barrel (hilarious) so the guys can have a shower.

There is a great title card that reads simple: IT HAD BEGUN..... So few words and yet so full of meaning. The battle images are among the best and bring the full horror of war home. Vidor assembles amazing scenes of men marching in line to death, of men trapped in shell holes, of planes swooping over the bombed-out fields. This is an incredible movie.

TCM host Robert Osborne mentions that THE BIG PARADE played for an astounding 95 consecutive weeks in New York and that it rivalled THE BIRTH OF A NATION and GONE WITH THE WIND as the biggest money-making film of all time. This is the film that, along with THE MERRY WIDOW, made John Gilbert the king of Hollywood in 1925. And his crown was well deserved; he is magnificent.",,"['Drama', 'Romance', 'War']","['1910s', 'reference to world war one', 'national film registry', 'bozo as epithet', 'blockbuster']",1925-12-03,"['King Vidor', 'George W.

The Big Red One,A hardened sergeant and the four core members of his infantry unit try to survive World War II as they move from battle to battle throughout Europe.,"This is an under-appreciated war film. You never see it on TV, I know of no widescreen version available on video, and no one talks about it in books, newspapers or on television, but it is worth renting. Made up of a number of short vignettes, the main characters experience everything from delivering a baby (in a tank!) to D-Day on Omaha Beach to liberating a death camp as they fight their way through Africa, Sicily, and Western Europe. I understand that it is semi-autobiographical, and boy, does it pack a wallop. From the opening scene to history repeating (almost) itself at the end, it is well-crafted, says a lot and leaves the viewer changed. When the voice-over at the end says that the only glory in war is surviving, you KNOW why. Watch in particular for how Lee Marvin leads his squad, in particular when he gives an extra clip of M-1 ammunition to one of his soldiers at the Death Camp to help the soldier process, in a unique way, the horror of what they have discovered. It is unforgettable.",10,"['Drama', 'War']","['western front of world war ii', 'nazi soldier', 'u.s. army', 'infantry', 'year 1945']",1980-07-18,['Samuel Fuller'],"['Lee Marvin', 'Mark Hamill', 'Robert Carradine']",['Samuel Fuller']
The Big Trail,Breck Coleman leads hundreds of settlers in covered wagons from the Mississippi River to their destiny out West.,"This movie is impressive for the type of physical props used. The wagons were real Conestoga, not the cut-down replicas seen in later movies. The circling of the wagons to fend off an attack by the locals was done with realism -- wagons overlapped with draft animals placed inside the ring -- resulting in what seems like hundreds milling about in the center. And when the shooting starts the wagons virtually disappear in the smoke. Very good representation of &apos;real life&apos; (I shoot muzzle loading rifles so I know about the smoke part of it).

Big Wednesday,The lives of some California surfers from the early 1960s to the 1970s.,"Big Wednesday is a celebration of life on the beach as seen through the eyes of three surfing buddies who only live for riding the wave. Gary Busey, Jan Michael Vincent, and William Katt, three blond California surfer types if there ever were are the three pals with a host of supporting surfing types.

The film is four vignettes over a 12 year period from 1962 to 1974 and amazing as it seems I did not hear The Beach Boys once over the soundtrack of the film. Quite an accomplishment for director John Milius in and of itself.

William Katt is a straight arrow type and and Gary Busey and Jan-Michael Vincent are screw ups to some degree. Vincent has the most interesting character, he&apos;s a surfing god when we first meet him, the idol of all, but he doesn&apos;t like the acclaim. He goes through more changes than anyone else in the film.

Barbara Hale who is William Katt&apos;s mother plays his mother her in her last big screen appearance. If she wasn&apos;t Della Street for so many years on Perry Mason she might have wound up doing Donna Reed or Barbara Billingsley or Jane Wyatt type roles. I loved her bearing up under it all demeanor while her house is being wrecked with a wild party.

Highlight of the film is the scene at the Selective Service induction center. All the young surfers try to avoid the draft, some with some truly creative ideas. William Katt actually goes to war, the other two avoid it, but Katt&apos;s not even trying.

Second highlight is the Big Wednesday of 1974 where all three try to prove they still have the right stuff for the waves. The waves were tipping on 20 feet.

Big Wednesday is a good buddy/buddy/buddy film about three guys who live for what they love, but who have to realize it&apos;s a young man&apos;s game.",7,"['Drama', 'Sport']","['timeframe 1960s', 'aquatic sport', 'outdoor sport', 'extreme sport', 'beach life']",1978-05-26,['John Milius'],"['Jan-Michael Vincent', 'William Katt', 'Gary Busey']","['John Milius', 'Dennis Aaberg']"

Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance),"A washed-up superhero actor attempts to revive his fading career by writing, directing, and starring in a Broadway production.","Whilst viewing &apos;Birdman&apos;, I spent the first hour of the film trying to decipher my emotions and opinions towards it, what I was watching was a weird, yet wonderful work of art. Truly though, &apos;Birdman&apos; is a technical masterpiece. Michael Keaton has generally been undermined as an actor (despite a few notable roles as Batman or Beetlejuice) and has instead faced Hollywood picking more acclaimed and popular actors, &apos;Birdman&apos; however might just be his ticket to an Oscar nomination, and possibly even a win, his performance is mesmerising. Alejandro González Iñárritu has created a truly spectacular character study that arguably features this year&apos;s strongest acting performances, alongside a well- executed script, booming soundtrack and a monumental achievement with cinematography from Emmanuel Lubezki in which he attempts a Hitchcockian approach, reminiscent of &apos;Rope&apos;, and displays the story through a seemingly single and unbroken sweeping shot.

The Birds,A wealthy San Francisco socialite pursues a potential boyfriend to a small Northern California town that slowly takes a turn for the bizarre when birds of all kinds suddenly begin to attack people.,"There is a kind of theory according to which a horror or thriller film would lose all its frightening effect if it did not have a musical support as a backdrop, and its greater or lesser intensity regulates the viewer&apos;s tension levels. And this is true, at least in most of these types of movies. But there is always an exception that proves the rule. In The Birds, an iconic film by director Alfred Hitchock (inspired by the eponymous short story by Daphne du Maurier), such musical intrusion was dispensed with, as the director wanted to give voice to these apparently harmless beings that terrorize the population of Bodega Bay (Bernard Herrmann appears in the credits only as sound consultant). The film, which dates from 1963, continues to promote an intense discussion about its meaning and the most varied hypotheses have been put forward, since the ending is left open, with the birds victoriously watching the removal of humans (of course Hitchcock knew that not giving an explanation would contribute to accentuating the mystery and interest that the film arouses, it is not his best film, but it is certainly one of the most enigmatic). Choosing the blonde on duty (one of my favorites) was also a winning bet. Tippi Hedren, the unlikely heroine, perfectly plays the role of the fragile young woman, who is able to stand up to the bloodthirsty bird though. Her image of scared eyes and disheveled hair covering herself with her hand is memorable. As far as I am concerned, the scene dominated by the couple of lovebirds always comes to mind, swinging along the curves, in the convertible on the way to Bodega Bay, inside a cage, without having the right to enjoy the landscape, as a trigger for the revolt of the birds.",8,"['Drama', 'Horror', 'Mystery']","['bird attack', 'california', 'paranoia', '1960s', 'phone booth']",1963-03-29,['Alfred Hitchcock'],"['Rod Taylor', 'Tippi Hedren', 'Jessica Tandy']","['Daphne Du Maurier', 'Evan Hunter']"

They fall madly in love, only to have him learn that his beautiful BIRD OF PARADISE is destined to be sacrificed to Pele, the volcano god.

Essentially a piece of fluff, this film is enhanced by the performances of Dolores Del Rio & Joel McCrea. They handle the romantics quite nicely (her skinny dip providing proof this is a pre-Production Code movie). The rest of the cast, which includes Lon Chaney Jr. & &apos;Skeets&apos; Gallagher, exist purely to provide support to the stars.

Bite,"While on her bachelorette party getaway, Casey, the bride to be, gets a seemingly harmless bite from an unknown insect. After the trip, Casey discovers that everything can change with a single bite.","Bite doesn&apos;t have any substance to it at all. It is the type of film which advertises its over-the-top gore in order to gain cash and I&apos;ll admit, that&apos;s the one thing this movie tried to do decently. For a low budget film, there&apos;s a lot of effort placed in the FX and the horrors induced by this single infected bite. It&apos;s a bit disgusting when you first view it, but as you go on in the film, it gets overdone and repetitive. This film tried too hard to gross the viewer out by adding a lot of gooey substance, crunching insect noises and decaying corpses but the thing is, nothing is done with it in order to internalize the disturbing imagery in the viewer&apos;s mind. It just keeps on adding it, thinking that a lot of gore will gross the viewer out but it just gets rather gratuitous and mundane. But for a low budget film, I&apos;ll accept it; it did its best to go beyond any horror film in our cinemas.

Other than that, the rest of the film is a mess. The casting doesn&apos;t feel right, the actors may range from okay to bad and the script is just plain horrible. Its one of those films I believe that all the filmmakers put their effort in the blood and the gore but ignore the other aspects of the story. I didn&apos;t like any of the characters except for Kirsten and it&apos;s difficult to care for the MC because albeit she&apos;s in a horrible state she still acts grim and immoral it&apos;s hard to feel any sense of sympathy for her. The dialogue isn&apos;t done very well to the point that it actually feels comedic and makes you question if this was trying to add humor to the story. 

This doesn&apos;t feel to have much of a plot, it just wanted to show the effects of having this infected bite. There are other aspects that it tried to include such as marriage issues, cheating and friendship but it all leads to the gore. In fact, it wasn&apos;t done very well in the first place and it feels hastily done and unnecessary to the film and what it wanted to show audiences which is, you got it right, the gooey gore. It relies to much on it to move the story forward when there isn&apos;t much of a story at all.

Bite feels like wasted potential. The filmmakers seemed to forget that it was a movie and not some blood fest. Every thought was placed in the gore that the acting, the plot and the dialogue were neglected, making it for a mediocre and amateurish experience in the cinema. The FX is the only thing that can be closely considered to checking this movie out.",3,['Horror'],"['infection', 'insect', 'female protagonist', 'vacation', 'fiance fiancee relationship']",2021-05-21,['Chad Archibald'],"['Elma Begovic', 'Annette Wozniak', 'Denise Yuen']","['Chad Archibald', 'Jayme Laforest']"
Blacula,"An ancient African prince, turned into a vampire by Dracula himself, finds himself in modern Los Angeles.","I saw Blacula in the theatre when I was 5 or 6 years old.

I wasn&apos;t allowed to watch a horror flick again until I was old enough to go on my own and buy my own ticket (and even then I stayed away for a while. . . the next one I saw was Nightmare on Elm Street when I was in highschool!!!).

Anyway, I saw the movie for the second time two nights ago, 29 years later.. . and it was not as scary as I remembered. However, I can see how my young mind was terrified at the time. AND, I can see how my teenaged cousins loved it so much. In 1972, this movie was at the early end of the blaxploitation era, and besides the fact that the main character was a bloodsucker, the characters were generally positive (i.e. no pimpin&apos; drug-dealin&apos; gangstas) You&apos;ll be hard pressed to find another early seventies black movie that can say that!

I think, for the time, it was a pretty good low budget horror movie.

The Black Cat,American honeymooners in Hungary become trapped in the home of a Satan-worshipping priest when the bride is taken there for medical help following a road accident.,"I won&apos;t comment about the acting or plot -- there&apos;s plenty of that here already. What I&apos;d rather do is call attention to the visuals -- the cinematography, lighting, costuming, and especially the set design.

Normally, horror films take place in ancient settings -- crude medieval fortresses and rustic castles that are dark, cluttered and gloomy. But this one is set in a perversely utopian sci-fi fantasy -- the clean lined, impeccably detailed, generously glazed modernistic and (usually) radiantly lit white-and-silver upper floor interiors of the house.

The lower floor is an expressionistic prison, also clean lined, but still dungeon-like with its windowless walls of exposed board-formed concrete. An elegant steel spiral staircase connects the two, and the angular expressionism reaches its culmination in the chamber used for the black mass.

Karloff&apos;s costumes recall Oskar Schemmer&apos;s Bauhaus-produced work -- angular, broad-shouldered, narrow-waisted and elegant. Even the haircut of this man of the future in sharp and angular. His character is an engineer and architect and is given the name -- Poelzig -- of a famous expressionist German architect and film set designer of the time, who was a colleague of the director on an earlier film.

A bit slow in some parts, but as a whole it ranks among the best slashers ever made.",8,"['Horror', 'Mystery', 'Thriller']","['christmas', 'sorority house', 'mysterious killer', 'telephone', 'telephone call']",1974-12-20,['Bob Clark'],"['Olivia Hussey', 'Keir Dullea', 'Margot Kidder']",['Roy Moore']
Black Dynamite,"Black Dynamite is the greatest African-American action star of the 1970s. When his only brother is killed by The Man, it&apos;s up to him to find justice.","It has taken me years to get around to seeing this film and I think that is due to how good it is at spoofing but capturing the look and feel of a clichéd 1970&apos;s blaxploitation film. You see, once many years ago I watched the Pam Grier film Coffy with my girlfriend who, after yet another scene of excessive nudity and/or violence, declared it the most ridiculous film she had ever had to watch. Likewise the few minutes of Black belt Jones that she saw as she walked through the room had her eye-rolling with the memory of the genre. So, the one time I did try and watch Black Dynamite, we didn&apos;t really get far into it before she rejected my claim that it was a modern spoof of the genre and said she didn&apos;t want to watch any more of this type of thing. Fair enough.

It is probably for the best because this film will play well with those that know the genre and all its trashy failings and weaknesses, those that hate blaxploitation will probably not enjoy seeing it replicated here. This is what the majority of the film does and, although it does so with a knowing wink and some very funny digs at the standards of the genre, it is first and foremost a 1970&apos;s blaxploitation made in this century. The plot is therefore a tough black man with a big heart and even bigger, ahem, who sets out to get revenge for the death of his brother but then gets motivated to help his community, ultimately leading him to taking out The Man at the highest corrupt level. Again, those who know the genre will know this and this is what the film does, but it does it with good awareness and excess. The shoddy filming is designed as such, lines flubbed, sexual material flaunted and supporting actors either over the top (African-American) or stiff and greasy (white). However it all works to capture the genre and recreate it with more self-awareness. The cast do well to do their part within the recreation. White is particularly good – handsome and gruff to order, but yet his timing is very good. The supporting cast also do their bits with turns from Hall, McKnight, Woodbine, Starr, Williamson and others – all enjoying themselves playing very basic genre caricatures.

Unfortunately I didn&apos;t share the experiences of those rolling in the aisles with laughter. I found it the film to be funny but not hilarious. I think this may have been because I didn&apos;t find the reaction of the genre to be inherently funny so much as others may have done – personally I just took it as a job well done by the makers. The comedy was in the little twists and excesses of that genre creation and this in itself gave me plenty to laugh at throughout the film. It was a little disappointing to find that it wasn&apos;t funnier – but it was still enjoyable.

Overall though, this is a comedy for those that know the blaxploitation genre because it recreates and affectionately mocks it from within. Perhaps this affectionate air stopped it being funnier or sharper but it is still an enjoyable comedy with a real sense of what it is sending up.",,"['Action', 'Comedy']","['outnumbered', 'license to kill', 'mob execution', 'vengeance', 'one man army']",2010-01-13,['Scott Sanders'],"['Michael Jai White', 'Arsenio Hall', 'Tommy Davidson']","['Michael Jai White', 'Byron Minns', 'Scott Sanders']"

This movie simply gives you the feel of the actual action which went on during this battle. 

Everything from the way the soldiers moved, took their position, fired from covered positions, gave covering fire to each other, the use of Explosives including grenade and the way they captured strategic places even without much help from Air Force gave a true and absolutely realistic view of Real Time Urban Combat. It shows that Humvees are not impenetrable and the Soldier manning the machine gun post is extremely vulnerable from Roof Top Fire. Again the way Small Arms like the LMG & UMG were used were impressive and the tactics used by Special Forces to fend off attackers and secure the perimeter was true to all my knowledge.

The Black Hole,"A research vessel finds a missing ship, commanded by a mysterious scientist, on the edge of a black hole.","I saw this movie in the theater when I was 6 years old. So you have to remember that frame of reference when you read these comments. 

I saw The Black Hole when I was six years old and, of course, I loved it. Although what I remember the most about that experience was my first glimpse of Maximilian, the giant killer red robot. Maximilian terrified me. And he ended up being the first movie character to ever really scare the crap out of me.

If you were 6 years old kid in 1980, you would remember this film. Because even though it&apos;s silly to make the comparison today, at one time the Black Hole held a special place in the hearts of kids everywhere, mainly because it featured a character who was even scarier than Darth Vader. 

That&apos;s right, Star Wars came 2 years earlier than the Black Hole, and Star Wars had a frightening guy in a black mask named Darth Vader. But let me tell you that to a kid growing up in 1980, Darth Vader was NOTHING compared to Maximilian. Darth Vader was a pansy compared to Maximilian, and I&apos;m not just joking around. If you were a little kid in 1980, you knew about this movie. And you knew who Maximilian was. And you spoke about him in terms of reverence. Because you don&apos;t mock the robot who haunts your nightmares every single night.

That&apos;s how big a deal Maximilan was at the time.

Yes, The Black Hole has flaws. Yes, the rest of the robots are comical. And yes, the science fiction in the movie makes no sense. And sure, I&apos;d agree that the sight of Ernest Borgnine in a tight turtleneck is disturbing and I never want to see it again. But none of that really matters to me. All I care about is that this movie features Maxmilian the bleeping killer red robot. And from a pop culture/movie history perspective, that makes this movie a classic.

Personally, I think that the Black Hole is a pretty lame movie. But in 1980 I would have ranked it alongside Star Wars as the coolest thing I had ever seen in my life. And of course, that is almost solely because of Maximilian. So don&apos;t make fun of this movie. Just remember that it cause a lot of nightmares in kids from the 70&apos;s and early 80&apos;s. And please give it props for featuring a villain that (at one time) was cooler and scarier than a guy named Darth Vader.

So here&apos;s to you, Maximilian.

Please don&apos;t Cuisinart me through a book.

Black Narcissus,"A group of nuns struggle to establish a convent in the Himalayas, while isolation, extreme weather, altitude, and culture clashes all conspire to drive the well-intentioned missionaries mad.","Deborah Kerr is designated to establish a convent in the Himalayas at a remote cliffside dwelling, a palace of dubious origin. She takes her assignment seriously and faces strange customs and unfamiliar peoples as well as a harsh climate. There are inner struggles as well, and Kerr is excellent at revealing these. Huge closeups reveal what her character is supposedly thinking as she peers at others, often in unspoken disapproval of their actions, particularly David Farrar, Jean Simmons (as an Indian girl), and Kathleen Byron--who gives the film&apos;s most urgent performance as the distraught nun with worldly pleasures on her mind. Kerr gives a faultless performance, the mainstay of the film, since most of the story is seen from her viewpoint.

The striking color photography and set decoration were rightfully awarded Oscars. A haunting, powerful study of the effects of loneliness and isolation on a group of nuns--and what happens when one of them goes beserk. The struggle between the two nuns at the bell tower is one of the most gripping climaxes ever.

I tre volti della paura,"Boris Karloff hosts a trio of horror stories concerning a stalked call girl, a vampire-like monster who preys on his family, and a nurse who is haunted by her ring&apos;s rightful owner.","This terrifying film with plenty of vampires , weird deeds and murders is formed by three stories proceeded in some memorably horrific set-pieces : 1) ¨The telephone¨ by author Snyder : A prostitute (Michele Mercier) terrorized in her flat by phone calls from a broken-out inmate (Milo Quesada) receives visit her lover (Lidia Alfonsi). 2) ¨The Wurdalak¨ by Aleksey Tolstoi : In a night of nightmare during the early 1800s , a Russian noble (Mark Damon, usual in Spaghetti Western) and a family (exceptional Boris Karloff, a gorgeous Susy Andersen, and Massimo Roghi) stumble vampires who must kill those love and go after their descendants ; the undead vampires of hell terrorize the house in a orgy of stark horror. 3) ¨The drop of water¨ by Chekhov : In the early 1900s , a nurse (Jacqueline Pierreux, mother of actor Jean Pierre Leaud, 400 blows) steals a ring from a medium dead and she seeks avenge , then a ghastly specter arises , exacting cruel revenge for past robbery.

Bava&apos;s second great hit (the first was Black Sunday or Mask of the demon) surprisingly realized with startling visual content and well scripted by Marcello Fondato and Albert Bevilacqua . This omnibus terror is plenty of thrills and chills in glimmer color and in lurid paste with sensational results . This genuinely creepy tale is photographed by Ubaldo Terzano and Bava himself with magentas , shades of ochre , translucently pale turquoises and deep orange-red reflecting paleness on the victims . Eerie and suspenseful musical score by Roberto Nicolisi , though in American version was composed by Lex Baxter , Corman&apos;s usual. The motion picture was stylishly and strikingly shot by Bava , filmed in parallel orbit to those Roger Corman ( Edgar Allan Poe cycle) and produced by American International (James H. Nicholson , Samuel Z. Arkoff) . Bava along with Riccardo Freda are fundamental kings of Italian horror , in fact collaborated deeply among them , as Bava terminated two films of Freda, ¨Il Vampiri¨ and ¨Caltiki¨ and they created the Giallo sub-genre. Rating : Good , acceptable atmospheric direction from genre master MarioBava , this is one more compelling horror ventures in which his camera stalks in sinister style throughout a tale with extraordinary visual skills . A must see for terror buffs.",7,['Horror'],"['lesbian subtext', 'vampire', 'ring', 'cigarette smoking', 'nurse']",1964-05-06,['Mario Bava'],"['Michèle Mercier', 'Lidia Alfonsi', 'Boris Karloff']","['Anton Chekhov', 'Aleksei Tolstoy', 'Guy de Maupassant']"
Black Sheep,A gubernatorial candidate hires a wormy special assistant whose only job is to make sure the candidate&apos;s well-meaning but incompetent brother doesn&apos;t ruin the election.,"I first watched Black Sheep in 2002. I was 11 and literally could not sit through the whole film. The pacing was slow, Farley kept falling down all the time and Spade essentially was just playing his same role from Tommy Boy all over again. Even though I liked Tommy Boy I hated this and many claim they are the same movie but I felt this was much inferior. Six years later I caught this again on Comedy Central and my opinion had not changed. I shut it off halfway through. Reading a biography on the late, great Chris Farley which was written by his brother, I made it a mission to rewatch all of the work he left us in the short time he was here, and rewatching Tommy Boy and laughing out loud all over again inspired me to give this one more try. Well I am much older now so maybe I got the jokes better because this was actually a lot of fun and quite funny. Of course still inferior to Tommy Boy but certainly a masterpiece compared to Farley&apos;s final film, Almost Heroes. While there are many similarities to this and Tommy Boy there are also quite a few differences. Although not as moving as his relationship with Brian Dennehy as his father in Tommy Boy, Farley does have some nice and heartwarming chemistry with Tim Matheson as his brother who is running for governor. That was inspired casting of course. Farley loved Animal House and idolized John Belushi so it would only be natural to get a star from the comedy classic to be his brother. Farley and Spade&apos;s chemistry this time is just as good as in Tommy Boy. The writing and jokes are very funny. I think this is slightly inferior to the aforementioned film because this relies much more on slapstick where the aforementioned had plenty but also had a lot of heart. While this did not have as much heart as Tommy Boy, there was still plenty to keep things afloat and enjoyable. A couple bonus points for this one include Gary Busey&apos;s hilarious supporting role and Christine Ebersole (Macaulay Culkin&apos;s mom in Richie Rich) makes a fine villian in the role of the incumbent governor opposing Matheson. She makes Bo Derek, Rob Lowe and Dan Aykroyd&apos;s villians from Tommy Boy all look kind in comparison. The pacing is actually just fine if you keep up with the jokes. The bat in the cabin scene where Farley and Spade try to rid of the bat is a hilarious highlight as well as Farley&apos;s visit to Matheson&apos;s appearance at an MTV Rock the Vote concert. This was directed by Penelope Spheeris who gave us her finest directorial effort with Wayne&apos;s World. Though she doesn&apos;t have as firm a grasp on this material as Peter Segal did with Tommy Boy this proves to be her next best work after Wayne&apos;s World and has some truly equally goofy memorable moments and dialogue. While I wish Chris Farley were still around to make more movies I can now say by giving this another chance, this one is to be celebrated among the finest work he did give us while he was here. Not as quotable or with as much heart as Tommy Boy but still one fun, likeable movie with many funny scenes, good performances and funny lines. Pair this with Tommy Boy for a double feature and celebrate the great work that the late Chris Farley left before his premature, tragic demise. God bless you Chris. We miss you man, and always will. Thanks for all the laughs buddy.

Black Water,A terrifying tale of survival in the mangrove swamps of Northern Australia,"Black Water (2007) 

**** (out of 4) 

Australian horror film about two sisters (Diana Glenn, Maeve Dermody) and one of their boyfriends (Andy Rodoreda) who decide to take a guided tour down a river where they can fish and see crocodiles. Once out in the water and far away from land, their boat comes under attack by a large croc and soon the guide is dead and the three friends are stuck in a tree without much hope for survival. This film was clearly influenced by Open Water even though this film too is based on true events. I enjoyed Open Water but thought it had several problems, which could have been fixed and the problems I had with that film aren&apos;t in this one and I must say I think this film is the best horror movie I&apos;ve seen in many, many years. off the top of my head I can&apos;t think of another movie that had my blood ice cold throughout it. There are at least five long scenes in this film where my blood was cold, the hair was standing up on my neck and I was curled up on the couch in actually terror. I&apos;ve never had a movie effect me this much as I&apos;ve seen so many that very few are able to get to me but this one actually did and boy was it a great feeling. I must say this film is a real joy as this genre has forgotten about scares and now basically goes for mindless gore. That&apos;s not the case here because each minute of this movie is meant to make you feel worried and put you in suspense. The execution is top-notch and the direction is downright flawless and never hits a bad note. The film runs just over 90-minute and there isn&apos;t much time given to the viewer to let them breathe because the film builds suspense every minute from start to finish. The film has a simple but very effective music score and the cinematography is great as well. Another big plus are the performances, which are excellent by the three leads. We don&apos;t get to spend too much time with them before the attack starts but it doesn&apos;t take long to really fall in love with all three characters and you can&apos;t help but want to see them make it out alive. Caring for them so much is another reason the suspense works because we don&apos;t want to see anything bad happen to them. Dermody really sticks out and I hope to see her in future movies. I really went into this film not knowing what to expect but it turned out to be one of the most memorable films I&apos;ve seen in recent memory.",,"['Action', 'Adventure', 'Drama']","['australia', 'boat', 'crocodile', 'song', 'children&apos;s music']",2008-04-24,"['David Nerlich', 'Andrew Traucki']","['Diana Glenn', 'Maeve Dermody', 'Andy Rodoreda']","['Andrew Traucki', 'David Nerlich']"

It uses the Jason Bourne lost memory and could possibly be a spy, criminal or soccer dad...who knows and people are trying to kill him. The director chose to go with shaky cam for ALL the action scenes. I do not mind shaky cam to promote tension or give the feel of what it is like to be fighting someone...but this shaky cam was used to disguised everythingincluding not haviing a good story. So many illogical scenes like people firing automatic weapons from point blank range(multiple times) and not even grazing the target. Double-digit ex machina scenes. A female character in a very intense action movie where she is killing people in hand to hand and gun and yet makeup and hair does not even have a smear.

I remember going to camp as a child, and hearing things outside at night. That was scary enough. This movie recreated that entire scenario and then added some to it. The fact that those things that go bump in the night outside your campsite were REAL in this movie makes it more nerve-inducing and frightening. As anyone, the first time I set foot in the ocean after seeing JAWS for the first time, I was nervous. Let me tell you in order to get from the movie theater to my house, I have to drive through the woods. After seeing this movie, that drive got SIGNIFICANTLY longer, more eerie, and scared the heck out of me. I went about 90 mph all the way home in order to get out of the woods!

Blazing Saddles,"In order to ruin a western town, a corrupt politician appoints a black Sheriff, who promptly becomes his most formidable adversary.","Remember the days when humanity could laugh at itself? Blazing Saddles is a film that takes us all back to a more innocent era. An era where PC was just a couple of letters stuck together. I&apos;ll get this out of the way first: To all of you pc commies out there... the racism in this film is there to MAKE THE WHITE PEOPLE THE BUTT OF THE JOKES!!!! There is not a single person of color in this film who plays a negative character. The rednecks are what this film is really making fun of. I think most people realize this (hence the 7.7), but there are still a few who don&apos;t.

This is such a funny film. From the opening scene along the railroad tracks to the shot of Gene Wilder and Cleavon Little riding off into the sunset in a limo, the film provides an endless stream of laughs. Every time a person views this film, they can notice something truly hilarious that they may have missed the last time. Mel Brooks doesn&apos;t always hit the mark with his comedy, but this film was by far his best effort.

Cleavon Little and Harvey Korman give the best performances in my opinion. I think Cleavon Little stole every scene in every film I saw him in. He died way too young, and I wish he could have acted in more films. Korman&apos;s Hedley Lamar character is a real hoot. By the end of my most stressful days at work, I often find myself talking to everyone in his voice. So evil, and so calculating! He and Slim Pickens played off each other flawlessly.

Good luck catching an un-edited version of this classic anywhere but on the DVD. Forget about any kind of an effective remake, either. Not in this day and age.

Don&apos;t miss this film! 10 of 10 stars.

Blonde Venus,A cabaret singer takes up with a millionaire to pay for her gravely-ill husband&apos;s operation.,"Billed as The BLONDE VENUS, a sultry German cabaret singer will do anything to save her sick husband and care for their child.

Acting under the flamboyant direction of her mentor, Josef von Sternberg, legendary Marlene Dietrich fascinates as a tender mother fiercely protecting her small child, who spends her evenings as a seductive stage siren, captivating audiences in America & France. She is equally good in both postures, her perfect face registering deep maternal love and sphinx-like allure. Dietrich is incredibly gentle crooning an old German lullaby at her son&apos;s bedside, while the contrasting image of her emerging from an ape suit to sing &apos;Hot Voodoo&apos; in a nightclub is one of the Pre-Code Era&apos;s most bizarre images.

Two British actors compete for Marlene&apos;s attention. Distinguished Herbert Marshall, with a voice like liquid honey, is ideally cast as Dietrich&apos;s conflicted husband. Playing a chemist poisoned by radium, his face reveals his humiliation at having to be supported by his wife; later, he manifests pent-up rage when he discovers her &apos;betrayal.&apos; Cary Grant, just on the cusp of becoming a major film star, plays a powerful political boss whose arrogance mellows as he pursues Dietrich&apos;s affections.

Little Dickie Moore, one of the OUR GANG members, is terrific as the infant son who is the bridge between Dietrich & Marshall. Here was a kid who could really act and tug at the viewer&apos;s heartstrings. Sidney Toler is amusing as a low-key detective. Gene Morgan, as a talent agent, and Robert Emmett O&apos;Connor, as a theater owner, very realistically portray denizens from the sleazy underbelly of the entertainment world.

Movie mavens will spot some fine performers in unbilled cameos: silly Sterling Holloway as one of the student hikers in the first sequence who discovers Marlene skinny-dipping in the forest; Clarence Muse as a stuttering bartender; dear Mary Gordon as Marshall&apos;s informative landlady; big Dewey Robinson as a gruff greasy spoon owner; wonderful Hattie McDaniel as Dietrich&apos;s New Orleans maid; and prim Marcelle Corday as Marlene&apos;s maid in Paris.

Paramount gave the film lavish, and slightly decadent, production values.

Bloody Sunday,"A dramatization of the Irish civil rights protest march and subsequent massacre by British troops on January 30, 1972.","Powerful, provocative & prompting, Bloody Sunday is a meticulously researched, expertly crafted & thoroughly gripping recreation of the Bogside massacre that occurred in the Northern Ireland town of Derry when British troops opened fire on civilians during a protest march, killing 14 & wounding just as many in the process.

Dramatising the events that led to the tragic incident on January 30, 1972, Bloody Sunday follows a civil right activist named Ivan Cooper who was the central organiser of the peaceful rally against internment that ended when British army paratroopers began firing on the unarmed demonstrators in full view of the public & the press.

Written & directed by Paul Greengrass, the movie sets its foreboding tone right within the opening segment after which it takes a step back to put its pieces on the board but once the stage is set, it explodes & moves forward with stunning immediacy. Greengrass&apos; direction is at its very best when things go south & the whole episode is extensively detailed in the script.

Cinematography employs the quasi-documentary-style to film the entire event as it unfolds, thus bringing the viewers right into the conflict, while the frenetic hand-held camera-work further reflects the chaotic nature of such circumstances. Editing is slick for the most part, music is nearly absent and its cast contributes with convincing performances, playing their given roles with utmost sincerity.

On an overall scale, Bloody Sunday is a fiercely directed, deftly scripted, viciously photographed, skilfully edited & brilliantly performed movie that brings the dreadful event to life with remarkable precision, brims with intense emotions from start to finish, and not only works as a riveting thriller but also as an unsettling documentary. Disturbing & disquieting but essential viewing nonetheless, Bloody Sunday is strongly recommended.",,"['Drama', 'History', 'War']","['1970s', 'army vs civilians', 'ireland', 'irish history', 'northern ireland']",2002-04-19,['Paul Greengrass'],"['James Nesbitt', 'Tim Pigott-Smith', 'Nicholas Farrell']",['Paul Greengrass']
Blow-Up,A fashion photographer unknowingly captures a death on film after following two lovers in a park.,"If you believe that the ending makes the movie, Blowup is for you. The first 30 minutes seem aimless and wandering, but they set up the main character and what is he is to discover about himself, about his occupation and about art in general. Antonioni builds tension (or frustration as you&apos;re watching it) not with plot, but with anti-plot. You want to scream at David Hemmings&apos;s character to: focus! screw those models! do something! But as the film unfolds you will see why Antonioni chose this actor, this profession and those girls. A wonderful manifesto about the dangers of voyeurism and what it does to a man&apos;s sexuality that is 40 years ahead of its time. The symbolism might get heavy handed at times (mimes, a broken guitar), but the sets are so full of creativity and the actors so beautiful (this will give my age away, but Vanessa Redgrave, who knew?) that you forgive Antonioni (he&apos;s Italian after all). Hemmings is Hugh Grant before Hugh Grant, but in this role at least, much more interesting. He&apos;s highly sexual, but unlike his painter roommate, his chosen art form represses him, all in the name of the shot. And when he finally gets the perfect shot in the perfect light, it&apos;s so perfect that someone steals it, and for good reason. Did those events actually take place or just through his camera lens?

the use of flashbacks are done seamlessly and works well to tell the back story of this amazing character.

there are a few things that maybe don&apos;t work here and there but 80 percent of this film is cate blanchette and she really is perfect.

at times it&apos;s woodyy allen-ish and at other times you forget and are sucked in by blanchette.

rest of cast is great... andrew dice clay is awesome in a very toned down role, louie ck is great is a small part... sally hawkins is awesome in her own way and very different from her sister jasmine... bobby carnivale chews some scenery.

if this movie sucks you in you will have a hard time forgetting it for a while... it hangs with you.",9,"['Comedy', 'Drama']","['self deception', 'sister sister estrangement', 'riches to rags', 'snob', 'congenital liar']",2013-08-23,['Woody Allen'],"['Cate Blanchett', 'Alec Baldwin', 'Peter Sarsgaard']",['Woody Allen']
The Blue Max,"A young pilot in the German air force of 1918, disliked as lower-class and unchivalrous, tries ambitiously to earn the medal offered for 20 kills.","Bruno Stachel is a lower ranked pilot in Germany&apos;s World War 1 air force, he dreams of winning The Blue Max, a prestigious medal given to pilots after 20 confirmed kills. As he rises thru the ranks, and his determination grows, he fails to earn respect from is comrades and more importantly, his superiors.

The Blue Max is a rare old thing, a flying ace picture that not only is in colour, it&apos;s also rather good. Perhaps a touch too long {as Stachel&apos;s romantic character arc gets over fleshed}, but a ripper of a movie harking back to genre greats back in the 30s and 40s. The vintage planes recreated are majestic, and joyously the aerial sequences in the picture do them much credit, stunts and dogfights flow with almost operatic ease. The story is a good one, based on the best selling novel from Jack Hunter, it&apos;s tale of a man who&apos;s determination is admirable but ultimately it&apos;s his undoing, will winning The Blue Max really make him feel he belongs with the aristocratic crowd?, are the sacrifices he makes worth it?. The ending here is excellent, its point is made, and closes the film with a sort of uneasy incredulity, it takes a good few minutes for the final sequence to really hit home, but when it does you know you have just been sold a highly inventive story.

Technically the film scores high, the direction from John Guillermin is safe, tho if at times guilty of filler scenes, the score from Jerry Goldsmith is perfectly blood pumping, whilst Douglas Slocombe&apos;s cinematography pleases the eye. The acting is fine, George Peppard puts guts and honesty into the role of Stachel, Ursula Andress smolders and oozes sexuality as the cheating Countess Klugerman {one bedroom scene had this viewer particularly hot under the collar}, whilst James Mason {sadly underused} owns the film as chief string puller General Klugerman.

"Blue Water, White Death",Documentary focusing on great white sharks.,"The wealthy Peter Gimble, model for Mr. Hooper of Jaws, hires a ship and a crew and staffs it with a truly mixed bag of professional underwater naturalists and photographers (and one folk singer) and sets off in pursuit of the great white shark. By the film&apos;s midpoint, cast and crew are in open mutiny. Peter Mathiessen, hired as voyage historian, thought the product of the trip would be the world&apos;s most expensive home movie but it is considerably more interesting, detailing in surprisingly vivid terms some real highs and lows for a trip that is part carnival, part nature study. Contrary to expectations, the most striking sequence involves not a great white shark but a group of sharks (primarily blues) feeding on a sperm whale carcass. By exiting the shark cages and photographing the feeding up close, the divers raised the bar considerably on this kind of filming. There are also memorable moments as when Stan Waterman and Valerie Taylor struggle through high seas to get back aboard the boat and Mr. Waterman promises the cameraman that if he ever films them struggling like that again without helping them, he will find himself in the water with them. The sequences involving the great white are not surprisingly very striking. I suspect there was a little after-action photography added to the sequence showing Peter Lake trying to cut the rope holding the great white to his cage. A minor point in a great film. There are also some great moments under the credits, my favorite being Stan Waterman describing how to drive off a shark with a SCUBA knife.

The Bodyguard,"A former Secret Service agent takes on the job of bodyguard to an R&B singer, whose lifestyle is most unlike a President&apos;s.","Bodyguard (1992)

Plot In A Paragraph: Frank Farmer (KC) a former Secret Service agent takes on the job of bodyguard to a singing superstar Rachel Marron (Whitney Houston)

Whilst I do not rate The Bodyguard as high as some people do. It is an enjoyable movie, I happen to have watched it a lot in recent years, and I always like it, but I can go years without feeling the need to revisit it.

It is hard to say what I don&apos;t like, as it&apos;s nothing in particular, I just find the directing a bit flat, and at times the actors are poorly framed. I remember I loved it when it was released, but by the time I watched it again on video, my opinion if it, had dropped considerably. 

The soundtrack is very effective, all the new songs are catchy and for the second year in a row, the single to a KC movie dominates the charts. I knew the song I Will Always Love You from the Burt Reynolds/Dolly Parton movie The Best Little Whorehouse In Texas. And whilst I still call it a Dolly Parton song, I know many call it a Whitney Houston one, and think of her version as the definitive one. 

Of the cast, in her first movie Houston is very good. I&apos;m surprised she didn&apos;t make more movies (she only made 4 more) as the talent was there. It&apos;s another less is more performance from KC, similar to his performance in The Untouchables, but it&apos;s still effective here, and he has some good, witty lines. All the supporting cast are fine too. 

The film had to undergo some hasty re-cutting when test audiences hated the original ending with Farmer dying after saving Marron. I remember KC saying in an interview, that he didn&apos;t even understand the new ending to the movie. 

Sadly for me the tacked on happier ending ruins things a bit!! As Farmer is clearly shot in the chest and gut at Oscars, but he turns up at the airport with his arm in a sling. 

It was another $100 million plus grosser for KC as The Bodyguard finished the year the 7th highest grossing movie of 1992, with a domestic gross of $121 million.

Bone Tomahawk,"In the dying days of the old west, an elderly sheriff and his posse set out to rescue their town&apos;s doctor from cannibalistic cave dwellers.","My Rating: 7.5/10 

A rock-solid western in the beginning, Bone Tomahawk transforms midway to become one of the most gruesome horror movies this year. It&apos;s not an unlikely combination. There have been a few titles in the past that falls under the western-horror category, but not many of them delivered so well.

Written and directed by S. Craig Zahler, the movie has a smart and tight screenplay. Zahler&apos;s story is unflinching and he never dilutes the intensity of what is shown on-screen. He succeeds in maintaining an air of unpredictability throughout the whole feature, and yes Zahler&apos;s name is definitely something to look out for in the future.

The story is set in the American old west, maybe during the end of 1800&apos;s. Four men are on a mission to rescue a few kidnapped people from a tribe of inbred man-eating savages. The quartet includes The Sheriff of the town Franklin Hunt (Kurt Russell), an injured Cowboy Arthur O&apos; Dwyer (Patrick Wilson) whose wife Samantha O&apos; Dwyer (Lili Simmons) is one among the captives, an armed gentleman John Brooder (Matthew Fox) and the Backup Deputy Chicory (Richard Jenkins).

The casting is okay but not great. The veteran actors Kurt Russell and Richard Jenkins give their best. Russell gives a fine performance as the Sheriff, making the whole premise believable. Jenkins&apos; character Chicory might be the most likable of all and his role feels so natural and belonged in the whole plot. Patrick Wilson does a commendable effort, and so does Mathew Fox. The only character that appears to be misplaced is the town doctor Samantha O&apos; Dwyer played by Lili Simmons. Her performance doesn&apos;t seem to blend in the 1800&apos;s period.

The cannibals were nightmarishly original. And their savagery is not just spoken of; rather it is shown in detail. The camera doesn&apos;t shift around much when it comes to the bloody violence. The eerie atmosphere together with the unpredictably quick turnarounds makes the feature quite effective. A major plus of this movie is that it sticks to being as realistic as possible. Be it the dialogues, the situations, the acting or even the gut-wrenching violence and gore, Bone Tomahawk is realism to the bone.

Recommended watch, if you can sit through a good old, slow paced, formal talked western in the former half and all the bloody gore in the later half, but ultimately the movie pays off.",8,"['Drama', 'Horror', 'Western']","['rescue', 'ambush', 'wilderness', 'native american', 'scalping']",2016-02-19,['S.

Bonnie and Clyde,"Bored waitress Bonnie Parker falls in love with an ex-con named Clyde Barrow and together they start a violent crime spree through the country, stealing cars and robbing banks.","&apos;Bonnie and Clyde&apos; is not a film about two real people famous for so many bank robberies and murders across the big country... It shows a new kind of fury in which people could be harm by weapons... The film, however, manages to carry the impression that these two youngsters took great pleasure in robbing banks and stores... It also suggests that it was very easy for them to fool the lawas certainly occurred in real life... Though merited punishment caught up with them, audiences laughed at their remarkable deeds and wanted them to get away...

In &apos;Bonnie and Clyde,&apos; Penn created an emotional state, an image of the 1930s filtered through his 1960s sensibility... The sense of this period reflects Penn&apos;s vision of how the 1930s Depression-era truly was, and for all the crazy style and banjo score, this vision is greatly private...

What is also personal about &apos;Bonnie and Clyde&apos; and constitutes its incomparable quality, is its unusual mixture of humor and fear, its poetry of violation of the law as something that is gaiety and playfulness...

&apos;Bonnie and Clyde&apos; is both true and abstract... It is a gangster movie and a comedy-romance... It is an amusing film that turns bloody, a love affair that ends with tragedy...

A modification between pleasure and catastrophic events is important to the essential aim of the film... In their second bank robbery, a daring and joyful action goes morosely embittered when Clyde is forced to kill an executive in the bank, and real blood pours out from his body...

Bonnie and Clyde take self-gratification posing for photographs with their prisoners But when surrounded by detectives in a motel, they turn into vindictive bandits struggling for their lives... C. W. Moss, specially, brings to mind Baby Face Nelson, when he murders policemen with a blazing machine gun...

One of the stimulating moments in the film happens when Clyde chases Bonnie through a yellow corn field, while a cloud transverses the sun and slowly shadows the landscape... Here the characteristic quality of the Texas countryside and the vague aspect of the story are beautifully communicated......

Bound,Tough ex-con Corky and her lover Violet concoct a scheme to steal millions of stashed mob money and pin the blame on Violet&apos;s crooked boyfriend Caesar.,"I watched this because I&apos;m a big fan of the Wachowskies, and after watching their first movie(Assassins, which they only wrote) I hoped to see another masterpiece from the makers of The Matrix that had nothing to do with it. It&apos;s no wonder the producers let them direct aforementioned sci-fi/action masterpiece after they did this. For such a little amount of money, they really made the most of it. Few characters, sets and occasionally limited camera-work is easy to look past(hard to notice, in fact). The movie is breathtaking. For the entirety of the last half I was literally at the edge of my seat, extremely excited and couldn&apos;t wait to find out what happened next. The first half is mostly a setup for the last half, but it isn&apos;t boring, and is well worth watching, as it makes the second half near-perfect in suspense. The lesbian subplot might throw some people off, and will definitely offend some people, but if you&apos;re aren&apos;t one of them, then you most likely will enjoy it, if you&apos;re into thrillers. The plot is very well-written, and with twists and turns thrown in every so often, it keeps you watching closely. The acting is mostly good, especially from the three leads. The characters are great... diverse, interesting and credible. The cinematography contains several of the same things later made famous in The Matrix... anyone who&apos;s seen both movies can tell that it&apos;s the same people behind the cameras. The action is really well-done. The story-telling is just slightly experimental... reminiscent of various heist flicks. This also contains some quite stylish visuals, though not as many as the brothers&apos; later works. All in all, just works really well and keeps you entertained throughout. I recommend this to any fan of the Wachowski brothers, thrillers and/or the actors in it. 8/10",8,"['Crime', 'Thriller']","['lesbian', 'mafia', 'stolen money', 'lesbian lover', 'lesbian relationship']",1996-10-04,"['Lana Wachowski', 'Lilly Wachowski']","['Jennifer Tilly', 'Gina Gershon', 'Joe Pantoliano']","['Lilly Wachowski', 'Lana Wachowski']"

You know that you&apos;re in serious schlock territory when the movie&apos;s mad scientist&apos;s assistants are a sadistic dwarf (played with glee by diminutive Hollywood legend Angelo Rossito) and a hulking disfigured man-child called Gor (John Bloom).

Brave,"Determined to make her own path in life, Princess Merida defies a custom that brings chaos to her kingdom. Granted one wish, Merida must rely on her bravery and her archery skills to undo a beastly curse.","Brave is a film I&apos;ve been looking forward to since I first laid eyes on it&apos;s beautiful trailer. It had everything a great Pixar film has: a wonderful setting, fantastic CGI, beautiful and interesting characters, and a lot of heart. In fact, Merida alone was such an interesting and adorable character, that it was instantly on my to watch list. Granted, this isn&apos;t Pixar&apos;s best, but that&apos;s holding it up to extremely high standards. As an animated film, however, this is a fantastic and fascinating film, a treat for the summer.

Brave tells the story of the aforementioned Merida, a young, Scottish princess whose life is controlled by her mother so that she can be shaped into a queen someday over the surrounding tribes. In an effort to change her fate and be free of her oppressive, but loving mother, she attempts to change her fate, and in the process makes a huge mistake. I won&apos;t get into plot details, as the trailer really doesn&apos;t give a lot away in terms of what this film is really about, but suffice to say, there is plenty of fun and adventure to be had.

Pixar always manages to create an interesting and unique tale, and this goes right up there with the best of them. Using the Scottish highlands is both an inspiring choice and allows them to craft a beautiful film. With sweeping mountains, water, and thick and colorful forests, this is one of Pixar&apos;s best looking films to date. It trumps the jungles of UP and even the magical underwater world of Finding Nemo. There is a certain amount of magic in the environments alone, and gazing on it is a wonder. The characters are also fantastic. Merida is a wonderful addition to Disney&apos;s princess lineup, and unlike those others, she is no damsel in distress. She, like her mother, is perfectly capable of handling herself, with her trusty archery skills and even tackles a few dangerous situations on her own instead of having someone there to save her. In fact, this could be seen as an inverse, as Merida actually becomes a hero in many ways and triumphs over the males in her own age bracket. Also of note is Billy Connolly, voicing Fergus, who lends his comedic chops to create a wonderful and likable character.

While this film may not be up there with Pixar&apos;s best, it still has a wonderful story and character interaction. Merida&apos;s relationship with her family feels genuine and most children will probably be able to relate. At the heart of the story is her relationship with her mother. This is more than a story about fate, but a story about obligations to family and how growing up means taking responsibility and putting away childish selfishness in place of those responsibilities. Although the core plot is unconventional and unexpected, it has a fantastic heart and once again proves that Pixar can tell a story like no other.

Brave is an entertaining, humorous, and heartfelt story that will be wonderful for kids and adults alike. Merida is a wonderful new character and the entire film looks beautiful. Even if you don&apos;t have children, I recommend this film if you&apos;ve loved other Pixar&apos;s before it.",8,"['Animation', 'Adventure', 'Comedy']","['princess', 'mother daughter relationship', 'archery', 'female warrior', 'witch']",2012-06-19,"['Mark Andrews', 'Brenda Chapman', 'Steve Purcell']","['Kelly Macdonald', 'Billy Connolly', 'Emma Thompson']","['Brenda Chapman', 'Mark Andrews', 'Steve Purcell']"
Braveheart,Scottish warrior William Wallace leads his countrymen in a rebellion to free his homeland from the tyranny of King Edward I of England.,"Most on this site pick the Godfather, or the Shawshank Redemption, but this is it, this is the best film ever made. People will complain, will argue that I am wrong, but I will say it again...Braveheart is as close to perfection as a movie can be. The acting is superb, the man who played Lonshanks, the actor who portrayed Robert the Bruce, both should have been nominated for Oscars due to their powerful rendering of evil and a man who is saved from losing his humanity (from becoming evil) by meeting William Wallace. And let us not forget the direction, the cinematography. Braveheart is glorious, beautiful to look at.

Breakin&apos;,A struggling young jazz dancer meets up with two break-dancers. Together they become the sensation of the street crowds.,Breakin&apos; is one of the movies that put hip-hop on the map. It turned disco into a new form of enjoyment. During the early 80s disco faded and from 1981 thru 1983 music groups introduced funk and techno type beats. At that time there was no specific dance to these songs. But I guess a couple of guys from the Bronx created a new dance that interested thousands of people in the metropolitan area. There was graffiti in the subway that displayed a urban form of art. The big boom boxes (large am/fm cassette radios) that young guys carry along the street. This was all hip-hop. The movie just inspired urban youth to do something creative with their talent.

Thirty years later, this film is still amazing to watch. Brewter McCloud is more like a cartoon, something to be viewed for pure entertainment value, even the dark parts (and there are many of those). Bud Cort (Harold and Maude) is delightful, and the supporting cast (many of whom are Altman regulars) is great......I think that people with little or no sense of humor will not like this movie, but those raised in the post-South Park era will enjoy its wonderful portrayal of neurotic characters...as only Altman can deliver &apos;em.",,"['Comedy', 'Crime', 'Fantasy']","['astrodome', 'flying machine', 'houston astrodome', 'character name as title', 'guardian angel']",,['Robert Altman'],"['Bud Cort', 'Shelley Duvall', 'Sally Kellerman']",['Doran William Cannon']

Brides of Blood,"Natives of a tropical island have to contend with man-eating plants and animals, mutations caused by radioactivity. Virgin sacrifices become the norm.

The plot synopsis actually makes it sound like you might be in for something rather enjoyable; but while the film definitely does have it&apos;s moments, they are few and far between and usually in the middle of a load of torrid and boring scenes. The film focuses on a primitive island where years earlier there were experiments with radioactive bombs. We follow a team who goes to the island in order to research the after-effects of the bomb as well as help the locals to build a village. However, there have been some unexpected side effects. The main problem with the film is that it really lacks a point; there&apos;s plenty of horror shown and it&apos;s actually quite inventive but it&apos;s not got any perspective. The special effects look extremely cheap and are unlikely to impress anyone; but they&apos;re fun to watch and directors Gerardo de Leon and Eddie Romero (no relation to George) have not let the budget hold them back as the effects are plentiful. Ironically though, it&apos;s the main monster that looks the most awful of all - it&apos;s unlikely to frighten anyone that is for sure! As mentioned, the plotting is all over the place and as such the film can be a bit boring at times, which is a shame and to be honest; I never really cared how it would all end. Overall, this does have some good moments; but it&apos;s not a good film and I wouldn&apos;t recommend anyone goes out their way to check it out!",5,"['Horror', 'Sci-Fi']","['bare chested male', 'tropical island', 'psychotronic film', 'spear', 'unwanted sexual advances']",1974-12-09,"['Gerardo de Leon', 'Eddie Romero']","['John Ashley', 'Kent Taylor', 'Mario Montenegro']",['Cesar Amigo']

Bringing Up Baby,"While trying to secure a $1 million donation for his museum, a befuddled paleontologist is pursued by a flighty and often irritating heiress and her pet leopard, Baby.","Animals play a significant role in Bringing Up Baby, adding absurdity to the comic situations and its theme of

crazed infatuation. When we first meet him, palaeontologist David Huxley (Grant) is preparing to marry his co-worker Alice Swallow (Walker). Alice, we learn, is a rational, no-nonsense woman who sees marriage as a convenient and rational transaction rather than as an expression of love. As the film opens, David and Alice are putting the final touches on a brontosaurus skeleton that he has been working on for five years. The skeleton seems to be a symbol of the couple&apos;s relationship - dry, brittle, tenuous, old and, most importantly, dead. 

Enter Susan Vance (Hepburn), whose wild anarchic nature is just what the doctor ordered. She seems, on the surface, hair-brained - and this may be true - but her ditziness is the result of being absolutely, utterly, ridiculously head-over-heals in love (at first sight, as is the case with most l&apos;amour fou scenarios) with David and doing whatever she can to sabotage his plans to marry Alice. Susan&apos;s leopard, named Baby, is the symbol of her love for David, for the moment the leopard lays its eyes on him, it is instantly affectionate and follows him around, just as Susan does. Jittery David is, of course, terrified of the beast and all that it represents. 

The leopard becomes an increasingly useful symbol as the film continues. At her aunt&apos;s estate in Connecticut, Susan releases another leopard its cage, thinking it is Baby captured by zoo officials when in fact it is a rogue leopard from the circus on its way to be gassed after attacking someone. With two leopards on the loose, the analogy becomes unmistakable - the wild leopard that Susan releases is David&apos;s libido, free at last after being repressed for so long in a loveless relationship. Indeed, towards the end of the film, when the wild leopard traps the host of characters in the local jail, it is nervous, terrified David who steps up and boldly saves the day. 

This I suppose is just one way of reading and enjoying a film like Bringing Up Baby. i think it&apos;s interesting that the film announces its interested in exploring psychoanalysis with the inclusion of a character who is a Freudian therapist (Dr Lehman played by Fritz Feld). Psychoanalysis was, of course, very popular among Hollywood screenwriters between the 30s and 50s who adopted all manner of coded symbols for sex after Joseph Breen&apos;s Production Code so tightly reasserted control over what could and couldn&apos;t be represented on screen. But the fact that Dr Lehman&apos;s diagnoses are so far off tells us that the science of the mind is no match for the power of l&apos;amour fou, which turns men and women into wild, irrational carnal beasts.",8,['Comedy'],"['leopard', 'museum', 'bone', 'psychiatrist', 'mistaken identity']",1938-02-18,['Howard Hawks'],"['Katharine Hepburn', 'Cary Grant', 'Charles Ruggles']","['Dudley Nichols', 'Hagar Wilde']"

It is not as effectively dramatic as &apos;If....&apos;, nor is it as delightfully whimsical as &apos;O Lucky Man!&apos;, but even if slightly inferior, this is a good film in itself, full of fascinating ideas and colourful characters.

Its a simple idea, but done well, because this was a long-running play, so had the time work out the dramatic and narrative effects, much more attention than the normal script would have.

Its Germans as the bad guys, of course, evil just dripping in the way that it only could between the great German wars.

I like this because of the way it co-opts the detective form. The viewer is drawn in. Clearly there are bad guys and good ones, but you don&apos;t know which is which  who to cheer for  until the end. You&apos;re drawn in as a sort of virtual detective.

Everyone is watching everyone else. Its the motive and roles you must learn.

The first time I saw it, in a cinema, I found it disappointing, somehow uncinematic. I saw it a second time, on television and it seemed much more comfortable in that medium.The third time I saw it, some twelve years later, it seemed like a little gem.

A squeaky voiced Mia Farrow disguised in a curly blonde wig and dark glasses foreshadows Mira Sorvino&apos;s performance in Mighty Aphrodite. The rest of the cast are unknown, some of the actors being real-life Jewish comedians and speciality acts. It is interesting to reflect on the interchangeability of Jewish and Italian behaviour in the film, the exaggerated emotions and the theatrical gestures. This is something that is apparent in other films such as Dirty Dancing or Moonstruck, which would have worked equally well as Jewish films or Italian films.

Allen gives one of his best performances as the hapless Danny, promoting a portfolio of one-legged tap-dancers, one-armed jugglers, balloon folders, parrot acts and glass harmonica players. He achieves a pathos which is lacking in his more autobiographical roles.

Broken Arrow,Terrorists steal nuclear warheads from the U.S. military but don&apos;t count on a pilot and park ranger spoiling their plans.,"If you want an action film in which the hero has a personality, and the bad guy has an even better personality, take a look at Broken Arrow. John Woo&apos;s choreographed action is not as dramatic as the Matrix-clone films that are so common today. He is great at creating interesting relationships between heroes and villains, and this film is a good example.

John Travolta is terrific. Christian Slater breaks typecast by playing a nice, sane soldier doing his duty. The love interest isn&apos;t an idiotic supermodel playing a nuclear scientist or something, but a park ranger, also doing her duty. She is cute, earthy, and actually believable.

If you want a film that will repeat every aspect of every other military adventure film you have ever seen, you will be disappointed. If dialog bores you, skip this film.

Brooklyn,"An Irish immigrant lands in 1950s Brooklyn, where she quickly falls into a romance with a local. When her past catches up with her, however, she must choose between two countries and the lives that exist within.","Crafted with care, told with elegance & resonating a deep sense of warmth throughout its runtime, Brooklyn is the story of an immigrant that beautifully illustrates the struggles faced when trying to adjust in a new environment with people you don&apos;t know & places you aren&apos;t familiar with, and not only does it work as a wonderful coming-of-age drama but also succeeds as a pleasant love story.

Based on the novel of the same name, the story of Brooklyn takes place during the early 1950s and follows a young Irish immigrant who leaves her hometown to seek a better future in the titular town of New York where, after struggling for a while, she manages to bring some stability in her life. But when an unexpected tragedy strikes back home, she&apos;s forced to confront her past and make a hard choice.

Directed by John Crowley, the plot is divided into three segments with the first one focusing on her inexperience & the difficult time she endures during her initial days in the new country. The second segment covers her life in Brooklyn and the different things she experiences there while the last one brings her back to the place she went away from where circumstances compel her to make a decision that will alter her life.

Written by Nick Hornby, the movie tackles the issues faced by immigrants in a lightweight manner plus the characters are quite compelling. The set pieces are reminiscent of the timeline it tries to depict, Cinematography uses different colour tones for each segment and its bright lighting keeps the ambiance more inviting. Editing unravels the plot in a controlled way and pace is never hurried. Plus, all the period drama elements are nicely handled.

Coming to the performances, Brooklyn packs a fine cast in Saoirse Ronan, Emory Cohen, Domhnall Gleeson, Jim Broadbent, Julie Walters & others, and all of them are convincing in their given roles. Effortlessly stealing the show is Ronan who carries the whole film all by herself plus her excellent performance is this flick&apos;s real highlight. Cohen & Gleeson chip in with fine supporting work while Walters is a treat to watch even if her appearance is quite brief.

On an overall scale, Brooklyn is a heartwarming, captivating & fulfilling movie that&apos;s as much about growing up & finding your identity in life as it is about love & relationships, is powered by a strong lead performance from Saoirse Ronan, and addresses its universal themes in a sensible manner. Expertly directed, deftly written, exquisitely photographed, patiently edited, consistently paced & aptly scored, Brooklyn is one of the better films of 2015 and is definitely worth a shot.",,"['Drama', 'Romance']","['irish immigrant', 'immigrant', '1950s', 'irish accent', 'brooklyn new york city']",2015-11-25,['John Crowley'],"['Saoirse Ronan', 'Emory Cohen', 'Domhnall Gleeson']","['Nick Hornby', 'Colm Tóibín']"

Buck Privates,"Two sidewalk salesman enlist in the army in order to avoid jail, only to find that their drill instructor is the police officer who tried having them imprisoned.","My uncle who later served in France during the second World War was one of those whose lives was interrupted by the peace time draft before the USA entered World War II. It was with some touch of irony that he will mention to this day he never saw any camp hostesses like Jane Frazee or the Andrews Sisters. 

But Buck Privates is an Abbott and Costello film, not a serious drama about the first peace time draft in American history. Bud and Lou got in the short run of this film several of their classic routines.

When Universal signed Abbott and Costello on the strength of their running appearances on Kate Smith&apos;s Radio Show, they were expecting to do a series of B programmers with them. They never dreamed that these two burlesque comedians would become the national icons that they did.

Shot on a shoestring the film made an exponential profit for Universal studios. Without the usual Hollywood ballyhoo that would have accompanied a major Hollywood production, Buck Privates returned many times the cost of production.

And through the serendipitous casting angel, Buck Privates also included the Andrews Sisters who got to sing three of their standards in this, I&apos;ll Be With You In Apple Blossom Time, You&apos;re A Lucky Fellow, Mr. Smith, and the immortal Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy from Company B. 

There are in fact so many musical numbers and so many A&C routines in this short film, there&apos;s barely room enough for a plot which involves a playboy Lee Bowman, his former chauffeur AlanCurtis, and Jane Frazee the camp hostess they both want to get better acquainted with. But because of that the film doesn&apos;t drag for a second.

Buck Privates set the standard for the films that Bud and Lou did for Universal. No doubt about it, their best work was in the early Forties and Buck Privates is the best of all.",9,"['Comedy', 'Musical', 'War']","['father son relationship', 'abbott and costello', 'boxing', 'blockbuster', 'basic training']",1941-01-31,['Arthur Lubin'],"['Bud Abbott', 'Lou Costello', 'Lee Bowman']","['Arthur T.

Bucktown,"After being hassled by The Man in a southern town, a cool operator asks some violent friends for help. After all, if you can&apos;t trust another brother, who can you trust?","I had never seen a Fred Williamson movie before, but BUCKTOWN has converted me into a fan. An incredibly likable hero with intelligence and morals, Williamson is a great actor surrounded by an even better supporting cast.

Duke Johnson (Williamson) returns to bury his brother in his southern town of Buchanan. While there, he encounters corrupt white cops, so he calls his black friends from the city to help him take them out. His only problem: the black gangsters now want control of the town. This plot would later be re-hashed in THE BLACK GESTAPO, by the way.

BUCKTOWN has great action scenes, but even better are the character development scenes and the entire execution of a great storyline. Williamson stands for justice and brotherhood from his entrance; anyone who criticizes his performance in this film is not paying attention. Pam Grier co-stars as Aretha, his sister-in-law turned girlfriend and since this is post-FRIDAY FOSTER, does a superb acting turn here. BLACULA star Thalmus Rasulala (also in FRIDAY FOSTER) is Roy, Duke&apos;s friend who takes over the town. Comic relief is provided by Bernie Hamilton as Harley (great, effective character) and Terrie Turner as Aretha&apos;s son (annoying, but important character). Carl Weathers makes more of his famous career as a blaxploitation extra as one of Roy&apos;s henchmen. At least he speaks here!

BUCKTOWN makes great use of the audience&apos;s feelings. At first, the audience empathizes with the black gangsters as they beat the senses out of the corrupt white cops, but then it turns ugly and brutal and the audience then feels bad for the cops. The audience&apos;s perceptions of the heroes in the film are constantly corrupted and that is unique for a film of this type. BUCKTOWN is not only recommended to blaxploitation fans, but also for those looking for a film with action, integrity, and intelligence.",8,"['Action', 'Crime', 'Drama']","['grindhouse film', 'motor vehicle', 'car', 'u.s. car', 'plymouth motor vehicle']",1975-07-02,['Arthur Marks'],"['Fred Williamson', 'Pam Grier', 'Thalmus Rasulala']",['Bob Ellison']

Bully,"A pack of naïve teenagers conspire to murder a mutual friend, whose aggressive demeanour has proven too much.","I watched this movie five days ago and I&apos;m still affected by it. Afterwards all I could do was cry for the youth of America, because this isn&apos;t just some movie. It really, truly happened. The actors turn in outstanding performances as teenagers with nothing to do but turn to sex and drugs to fill the empty voids in their lives. Nick Stahl is particularly amazing as Bobby, the boarder-line psychotic who tormented his friends until they could take it no more.This is a sad, realistic look at how many teenagers really do act with their peers. Don&apos;t look for your typical teenager fare here because you won&apos;t find it. The language, sex, and drug use may bother some people, but thats because no one wants to believe that young adults can be this way. Well, I got out of high school two years ago and I can tell you that this is not far from reality. Thats probably why it has affected me so much...because I know that stuff portrayed in this movie really does happen. This is a great movie. Watch it.

The Burning,"A former summer camp caretaker, horribly burned from a prank gone wrong, lurks around an upstate New York summer camp bent on killing the teenagers responsible for his disfigurement.","I first saw this in the late 80s. Revisited it recently on a DVD. Weinstein brothers made their debut with this poor man&apos;s Friday the 13th done right. The special effects were done by Tom Savini n he nailed it. The raft scene is the best highlight. Lots of stabbings via the gardening shears, slashings, severed fingers, etc. It&apos;s definitely worth a view for fans of slasher movies. There is sufficient violence n nudity but the sex scene is one of the lamest. The plot- a group of kids decides to play a prank on the caretaker of a camp. The joke goes bad n the victim sets himself on fire. He is released after five years from the hospital but his face has been deformed n he seeks vengeance. The cast included future well-known actors. The movie is full of slasher clichés, wandering away from everyone for a nude pond dip, having sex in the woods, going down to the basement alone, not defending oneself but rather running helter-skelter, not making an effort to make sure that the killer is dead once its down. The movie has one very different aspect, there was no waiting until the end for the big reveal of the killer&apos;s identity, its fully revealed from the onset.

The Burrowers,In the Wild West a rescue party sets out to find a family of settlers that has vanished from their home under mysterious circumstances.,"The Burrowers is written and directed by J.T. Petty. It stars William Mapother, Sean Patrick Thomas, Clancy Brown, Laura Leighton, Doug Hutchison, Karl Geary and Robert Richard. Music is by Joseph LoDuca and cinematography by Phil Parmet.

August the 11th 1879, the Dakota territories, and after a family of pioneers are abducted a posse is formed and go off in search of the culprits. It is believed they have fallen prey to hostile Native Americans, but once out in the wilds the truth hits home and the posse find themselves in a brutal and bloody fight for survival.

It&apos;s not like Tremors! That wonderful homage to the B movie creature features of the 1950s is played for laughs and action thrills. The Burrowers admittedly on plot synopsis&apos; does lend one to think that a fun packed creature feature is in the offering, but as many unaware film fans have found out, this is far from being the case.

I would rather walk in the right direction than ride with my head up my ass.

The Burrowers takes itself seriously, and not insultingly so. J.T. Petty wanted to make a Horror/Western but not in the schlocky sense. He even infuses the narrative with some human concerns and statements, ecologically and racially so.

The pace is very, very deliberate, so potential first time viewers need to take that into consideration. Once the plot is kick started in the opening salvo, the posse go out into the wilds and interact, for better and worse, dialogue is sharp and pointed, intelligent even.

A number of great character based scenes are setting the tone for what is a downbeat picture, while when the action comes in tantalising spurts, it&apos;s well marshalled by Petty, and it&apos;s not just all about the creatures either.

The look is of a classical Western, which considering the modest budget is quite some achievement. From costuming and props, to the colour palette, the film convinces as the Old West of 1879. In this regard it would have been very interesting to have seen Petty make a standalone Oater.

Practical effects are very decent and CGI is wisely used sparingly, though the big showdown at pic&apos;s end is something of a let down. Elsewhere Sir Clancy of Brown and Doug The Thug Hutchison are sadly under written, though the face fuzz department scores high marks!

A tricky one to recommend to either Horror or Western fans, but for atmosphere and a great sense of period - and no little amount of originality as well, it&apos;s worth checking out as long as you don&apos;t expect Tremors. 7/10",7,"['Horror', 'Thriller', 'Western']","['horror western', 'pool of blood', 'coconut cake', 'no opening credits', 'missing person']",2008-09-21,['J.T.

It baffles me to think any film can achieve this level of mediocrity while trying to be good. 

This film truly belongs in the pantheon of awful films,, including Batman and Robin and battlefield Earth. The film manages to not have a single good aspect, while still managing to not be funny nor serious.

I had seen it various times through the years. Last night was the first time I had seen it in along time. Without Richard Pryor it could have been an after school special. I have always liked Richard Pryor in his films, he always played a normal human being, he never got into the supercop comedies like Eddie Murphy did. Pryor showed in this film that he could be tender as well as funny. It is a little gem of movie, very lite, but very funny and heartwarming.

Byleth (Il demone dell&apos;incesto),"A man who&apos;s been in love with his sister since childhood returns after a year&apos;s absence to find she has married. Soon, several women in the area start turning up dead with strange wounds on their necks.","I only have a brother, and I hardly ever get the urge to shag him, so the subject of incest is all new to me. Byleth explores the subject by placing it in a more superstitious era, mixing it up with a possible supernatural angle, throwing in a whole load of nudity, and confusing the crap out of me to boot.

Mark Damon has a sister whom he likes. Really likes. He&apos;s a Duke and stays in a big castle with loads of staff giving him the glad eye but the film heavily implies that the only thing that gets Mark up and angry is his sister, played by Claudia Gravy. That&apos;s a problem, because Claudia has just returned after being away and she&apos;s got married during that time. The other problem is the serial killer going around killing red-headed women. The other other problem is that there might be a demon involved, and the other other other other other other problem is that the demon might be possessing Mark! How&apos;s he supposed to get into his sisters knickers with all that going on.

That amount of stress would usually kill all the romance dead in the water, but this is a seventies Italian film and therefore everyone&apos;s as horny as a Glaswegian lass full of blue WKD. This helps the director pad out the film with endless wriggling sex scenes that look about as natural as Kim Kardashian&apos;s arse. Mark does a lot of spying on people as well during this film, and every actress has red hair and looks similar, so things become confusing really quickly.

Is Mark possessed by a demon or is that just an excuse for him to frottage his sister&apos;s leg? Who is that guy he keeps seeing on the horse who kind of looks like him but might not be? And what happened at the end?

No really - what happened? It didn&apos;t make sense to me.

This is surprisingly watchable due to Mark Damon acting mental.

For me it re-ignited the flame in what was a dying genre, being poisoned by numerous of extremely bad films. Not only did it make it&apos;s way into my favorite horrors of all time, but it makes me have faith that people can once again create a true horror. Now there are only remakes of horrors, ( Friday the 13th, A Nightmare on Elm Street ....) or prequels, ( Prometheus ).

This movie is full of twists and turns you don&apos;t know what way it&apos;s going to go. It&apos;s smart, funny, gory and sexy with fantastic acting by all the cast. I was on the edge of my seat hungry for more.

Caddyshack,An exclusive golf course has to deal with a brash new member and a destructive dancing gopher.,"The 1980s saw some okay music, the advent of computers into the home was really taking off, and the science fiction genre (riding off the coat tails of Star Wars) was really making a comeback in feature films.

But not everything from the 80s is golden, as I mentioned in some previous reviews. And Caddyshack is one of them.

Simply put I don&apos;t get this film. I really don&apos;t. Bill Murry has a kind of Ahab-like obsession with a rodent chewing up his workplace home turf, and there&apos;s some thing about a gold contest and an examination of snobbery. 

Bill Murry acting like a drugged out gardener is not funny. It simply is not funny. I don&apos;t know why people (mostly men) heap praises on it, but it is not funny in the least. Or, rather it could be but you would have had to have shaved off several IQ points from your personal intelligence quotient.

And I can&apos;t make it any plainer than that.

This is one of those few rare occasions where the sequel is funnier, and given that this film is worthy of a smirk or two at best, that&apos;s not high praise.

If you like idiotic humor, then maybe check out this film, but don&apos;t say I didn&apos;t warn you.

Caged Heat,"In a women&apos;s prison, a group of inmates band together to combat the repressive and abusive policies of the warden and the corrupt prison doctor.","I&apos;m not quite sure what to think of Caged Heat. Don&apos;t get me wrong I think Demme is a magnificent director but thisUgh, I&apos;m not sure what to say. I read that Caged Heat was praised by critics, I could probably see what they saw in comparison to other girls in prison flicks. It didn&apos;t have that aspect of a campy movie. It had some style to it which is good. It shows that Demme had some sense of artistic view from the very beginning of his career. You can tell that he took time in planing out shots. The best example of this is when the camera is passing by the prison cells and you can see each inmate doing something different. Those are also signs of good directing. The characters are memorable and well developed. The movie doesn&apos;t aim for showing a lot of skin. Sure some of the girls are very attractive (especially the two blond ones), still the movie doesn&apos;t rely on sex at all.

I guess you can say this is a decent first attempt. Considering the budget he had to work with, I&apos;d say its pretty good. Its good to see directors work their way up but never forget where they came from. Demme was grateful to be working with Roger Corman and it shows. He gave him a role in Silence of the Lambs. Nevertheless Caged Heat is nice to check out. It&apos;s great entertainment that&apos;s for sure.

Cahill U.S. Marshal,A tough Marshal has a difficult task when his two sons join a gang and rob a bank.,"Many liberals like to bitch John Wayne out - I know because being a left-winger I have to put up with whiny liberals for company! What many of these liberals forget is that John Wayne - whilst politically unacceptable in many ways - was still an actor and a human being. Something some &apos;&apos;liberals&apos;&apos; complain about is Republican political oriented criticism on liberal actors and directors and the disrespect of the artistic talents of these liberal personages. I see no difference in disrespect to a left-winger or a right-winger so the hypocritical stance of these liberal &apos;&apos;film fans&apos;&apos; doesn&apos;t do their ideology any favours.

The film &apos;Cahill U.S. Marshal&apos; whilst not being the greatest of westerns, is an enjoyable western with a good message - which isn&apos;t as Republican or right-wing as some other voters claimed. The wonderful acting from John Wayne and George Kennedy is on par with their best work, the plot is original and the opening of the film is fantastic and rousing.

One of the features that other voters have not commented on is the music by Elmar Bernstein. The score for &apos;Cahill&apos; is amongst the great composer&apos;s finest work and the song &apos;A Man Gets To Thinking&apos;&apos; sung by Charlie Rich is a good theme on par with the &apos;True Grit&apos; by Glen Campbell and I am sure that a lot of Country and Western fans - I am only mildly enamoured with this genre - will enjoy it.",7,"['Drama', 'Western']","['apache indian', 'downpour', 'escape from jail', 'town', 'rifle']",1973-07-11,['Andrew V.

The Call of Cthulhu,"While sorting the affairs of his late Uncle, a man accidentally stumbles across a series of dark secrets connected to an ancient horror waiting to be freed.","The Call of Cthulhu is one of Lovecrafts superb horror short stories. The action is set in the 1920&apos;s and this film does not change any details of the plot (at least as far as I can tell).

Films based on Lovecraft&apos;s Cthulhu mythos are nearly always terrible. This is because modern horror films rely on gruesome shocks and all too familiar plots. Lovecraft&apos;s tales tend to be non linear (e.g. told in dream sequences or as pages from a diary and so on), and the monsters rarely make appearances. Turning &apos;The Call of Cthulhu&apos; into a film is certainly no easy prospect - especially on a low budget.

The makers of this film have made a virtue out of a necessity. The home made quality of the special effects are charming. The film is presented in black and white and with no dialogue. This all helps to maintain as professional a standard as possible in this small scale production. Captions are provided to accompany the storytelling and the film has quite a striking soundtrack.

Most horror fans will find this film tedious and the special effects jerky (and sometimes home made). I enjoyed the quirky and inexpensive approach to the special effects used in this film and felt that the production imitated the techniques that may have been used in a vintage film or in a stage production.

This movie is what happens when a bunch of movie stars who just happen to be close friends in real life decide to make a movie just for fun.

I can&apos;t really say that this film is full of great acting because the entire cast horses around through the whole movie. Jackie Chan makes his first appearance in a American movie with this film and both Hal Needham and writer Brock Yates have cameos. Don&apos;t expect a lot in the way of plot or acting or effects or anything like that and just enjoy the ride. The outtakes at the end of this and Cannonball Run II are hilarious and it makes it more fun for me anyway to know that this movie was just like a big meeting of old friends. Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. are great as Blake and Fenderbaum respectively. Burt Reynolds and Dom Deluise anchor this film (they&apos;re the main characters)and the give and take between these two make them one of the best comedy teams I have ever seen.

**** (out of 4) 

Martin Scorsese&apos;s remake of the 1962 Gregory Peck/Robert Mitchum thriller has a flaw here and there but overall I feel it&apos;s one of the best of its kind and the director&apos;s most underrated film. Robert DeNiro plays the crazy ex-con out to seek revenge on the lawyer (Nick Nolte) who he feels misrepresented him. This was the first Scorsese/DeNiro film I ever watched and it made me the die-hard fan I am today. I saw this thing four times in the theater and only God knows how many times since then but it remains one of my favorite thrillers as I feel the director hits all the right notes when it comes to the suspense but he also sprinkles in some very dark humor as well. DeNiro is simply wonderful in his role and comes off very threatening and at times downright scary. Nolte and Jessica Lange also turn in strong performances as does Juliette Lewis. Peck, Mitchum, Martin Balsam and Joe Don Baker also add great support. It&apos;s strange but I still remember the four screenings of this in the theater and I remember them quite vividly. I still remember all the suspense and terror that was running throughout the theater and all of this came back as I picked this film to show my buddy and our dates. The film went over very well with them but it also worked extremely well for me even after all these viewings. The stakeout scene towards the end remains one of the most suspenseful scenes from any movie I&apos;ve seen but there&apos;s also the equally disturbing scene where DeNiro goes to visit Lewis at school. I also gave the original film four stars but overall I prefer this remake. The original was pretty much good guy Peck versus bad guy Mitchum, which was a lot of fun but I like the changes made to the story here. We&apos;ve got the evil DeNiro against the bad boy Nolte. I like the fact that Nolte&apos;s character wasn&apos;t very likable and I enjoyed the changes that made the wife and daughter connect to DeNiro&apos;s character. The level of strong characters in classic Scorsese film&apos;s in here to be seen and with the strong performances this just adds to the overall greatness.",,"['Crime', 'Thriller']","['revenge', 'violence', 'houseboat', 'home invasion', 'bible quote']",1991-11-15,['Martin Scorsese'],"['Robert De Niro', 'Nick Nolte', 'Jessica Lange']","['John D.

Captain America: The First Avenger,,"Having been refused several times for The Army, Steve Rogers is finally successful, once there he takes part in a project and becomes Captain America.

I know I&apos;m late to the party, but what a party, my Marvel journey starts here. On the whole, I really did enjoy it, it&apos;s action packed, it&apos;s well paced, it&apos;s fun. There is no ambiguity here at all, it&apos;s a case of the good guys versus the bad, Captain America is a wholesome, kind and brave American, Schmidt is a fairly basic, scheming villain, Hugo Weaving makes him interesting though.

I rate Chris Evans, I&apos;m a big fan of his, and I did very much like the way he played the part, there was a degree of humility, a whole lot of sincerity.

Some nice special effects, and plenty of action scenes. I loved the production values, especially the way they recreated a war torn Britain.

I really appreciated the wry humour, and of course enjoyed the story of the little guy overcoming adversity to save the world.

First one down, I really rather enjoyed that, considering where this sits in the Marvel world, I thought it was good, 7/10.",7,"['Action', 'Adventure', 'Sci-Fi']","['superhero', 'based on comic book', 'nazi', 'marvel comics', 'scientist']",2011-07-22,['Joe Johnston'],"['Chris Evans', 'Hugo Weaving', 'Samuel L.

Captain Fantastic,"In the forests of the Pacific Northwest, a father devoted to raising his six kids with a rigorous physical and intellectual education is forced to leave his paradise and enter the world, challenging his idea of what it means to be...","Greetings again from the darkness. There seems to be no end to the theories on how to be an effective parent and raise kids who are productive, well-adjusted and successful. Writer/director Matt Ross offers up a creative, entertaining and thought-provoking story of one family&apos;s unconventional approach in a world that seems to expect and accept only the conventional.

We are first introduced to Ben (Viggo Mortensen) and his six kids as they are stalking a deer while deep in the Pacific Northwest forest  only this isn&apos;t your buddy&apos;s weekend deer hunting trip. Each family member is covered head-to-toe in mud and other means of camouflage, and the oldest son Bodevan (George MacKay) takes the lead with his knife in what is presented as a rite of passage into manhood.

The family carries out a daily ritual that includes extreme physical conditioning, lessons on survival and living off the land, and advanced education that includes reading such diverse material as Dostoevsky and Lolita. Each evening is capped off with an impromptu musical jam. It&apos;s evident that self-sufficiency, intelligence and family loyalty are crucial to Ben&apos;s approach  an approach that is challenged when circumstances require the family board their Partridge Family bus (named Steve) and take a cross-country road trip into a civilization that doesn&apos;t know what to make of them (and vice-versa).

The film is jam-packed with social commentary on education, parenting, societal norms, societal influences, and even grief. Who gets to decide what is best for a family or what&apos;s the best method for education? Sometimes the dysfunctional family isn&apos;t so easy to identify. Director Ross proves this in a gem of a dinner table scene as Ben and the kids visit Kathryn Hahn, Steve Zahn and their two sons in suburbia.

In addition to the terrific performance by up-and-comer George MacKay, the other actors playing the kids are all very strong and believable: Samantha Isler as Kieyler, Annalise Basso as Vespyr, Nicholas Hamilton as Rellian, Shree Crooks as Zaja, and Charlie Shotwell as Nai. Screen vets Frank Langella and Ann Dowd bring presence to the role of their grandparents and provide the greatest contrast to the off-the-grid existence of the kids.

Viggo Mortensen truly shines here and gives a performance full of grace and depth as he displays many emotions (some of which aren&apos;t so pleasant). He even goes full-Viggo for one of the film&apos;s many humorous moments  though the comedy is balanced by plenty of full scale drama. His best work comes in the scenes when he begins to question that there may be some flaws in his plan  the moments of self-realization are stunning.

Many will note some similarities between this film and Little Miss Sunshine (2006), though this one carries quite a bit more heft. It&apos;s beautifully photographed by cinematographer Stephane Fontaine (A Prophet, Rust and Bone) and captures the danger and solitude of the forest, while also capturing the more personal family dynamics. It&apos;s a film that should generate plenty of discussion, and one of the questions is  will Noam Chomsky Day ever match Festivus in popularity?",8,"['Comedy', 'Drama']","['funeral', 'suicide', 'suicide of mother', 'reference to noam chomsky', 'loss of wife']",2016-07-29,['Matt Ross'],"['Viggo Mortensen', 'George MacKay', 'Samantha Isler']",['Matt Ross']
Captain John Smith and Pocahontas,Captain John Smith overcomes the treachery of some of his men and resentment of the local Native Americans to establish the colony of Jamestown.,"This independent production of the famous story coming out of Jamestown&apos;s founding released from United Artists plays like a combination of one of those educational films and a Grade C western. Even the Indians are made up to look like plains Indians instead the ones east of the Mississippi.

The story of how Captain John Smith was saved by Pocahontas pleading for his life is only the beginning here. Some upper class types who don&apos;t like the way Smith has taken over the leadership of the Jamestown colonists start trading ancient matchlock rifles with the Indians and later frame one of them for a colonist&apos;s murder. It&apos;s so dumb, I don&apos;t even think the Saturday afternoon kid matinée crowd swallowed this one.

Anthony Dexter who never quite got the career that playing Rudolph Valentino was supposed to bring him is Captain Smith and Jody Lawrence is Pocahontas. Douglass Dumbrille is an impassive and suspicious Powhattan and James Seay is the villain Wingfield who&apos;s behind all the nasty goings on. They all go through the motions essentially, I think they realize how dumb it was.

The Jamestown story actually deserves a good film. It was more disease and the elements in a new land that the settlers faced rather than the native inhabitants. Remember the Indians hadn&apos;t yet learned how grabby the white man was.

The story deserves a good film, but this isn&apos;t it. The Walt Disney cartoon had more going for it.",3,"['Drama', 'History', 'Romance']","['character names as title', 'king james i character', 'captain john smith character', 'pocahontas character', 'based on real person']",1953-11-20,['Lew Landers'],"['Anthony Dexter', 'Jody Lawrance', 'Alan Hale Jr.']","['Aubrey Wisberg', 'Jack Pollexfen']"
Captain Kronos: Vampire Hunter,A master swordsman and former soldier and his hunchbacked assistant hunt vampires.,"Proof definite that Hammer could survive without Christopher Lee, Peter Cushing, or even their borrowed Universal monsters (Frankenstein&apos;s monster, Dracula, the Mummy). Kronos is an entirely original take on vampires and monster-hunting. Brian Clements (The Avengers) has fun with the concept, and you&apos;re never quite sure if you&apos;re watching a parody or a homage. Kronos works either way, though. Check out the swordfight scene that&apos;s a parody of every Western ever, when Kronos kills three men before they (or us) can see him draw his sword. Lots of action, and an interesting vampire concept, make for a must-see movie.",,"['Adventure', 'Horror', 'Mystery']","['chekhov&apos;s gun', 'skeleton', 'death of husband', 'scream', 'screaming woman']",1974-06-14,['Brian Clemens'],"['Horst Janson', 'John Carson', 'Shane Briant']",['Brian Clemens']
Captain Phillips,"The true story of Captain Richard Phillips and the 2009 hijacking by Somali pirates of the U.S.-flagged MV Maersk Alabama, the first American cargo ship to be hijacked in two hundred years.","Paul Greengrass has proved his talents with two fantastic Bourne films, The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum, and two impressive real-life dramas, Bloody Sunday and United 93. Green Zone, while being a little like Bourne in Baghdad, was also a worthy thriller. Captain Phillips sees Greengrass deliver another true story to the big screen, proving that he is indeed the current king of cinematic re-enactments.

Tom Hanks gives one of his finest performances in a long time. His Captain Phillips is a professional, serious man that keeps his emotions in check while sternly ensuring his crew understands his expectations. As the situation escalates, his emotions begin to creep through. Leading towards a final release that is both heartbreaking and relieving. Hanks&apos; character isn&apos;t explored too deeply, but we are nevertheless with him every step of the way.

In a fantastic casting choice, Tom Hanks is more than matched by Barkhad Abdi, who truly shines as the lead pirate. We&apos;re given more access than expected to this character – to all four pirates for that matter. Abdi manages to evoke empathy from a character that could have easily succumbed to stereotypical villainy. His performance provides a complex level of emotion to the proceedings. He knows that the situation has easily ran away from him, yet he naively decides to re-assure himself – and Captain Phillips – every chance he gets.

This is no-nonsense filmmaking of the highest order. Paul Greengrass&apos; kinetic camera rises above the sometimes dizzying approach from some of his last films. The hand-held factor works beautifully here, ensuring the you-are-there level of realism is cranked to a ten at every second. As the events escalate, we are always kept aware of what is happening. While skipper jargon and navy terms are exclaimed every which way, care is placed on making sure we still know exactly what is going on. Billy Ray (Breach, State of Play, The Hunger Games) constructs a taut and clear screenplay that compliments Greengrass&apos; filmmaking style.

To call this tense is an understatement. Henry Jackman&apos;s score pushes every sequence to an almost unbearable level of tension, Barry Ackroyd&apos;s cinematography beautifully captures the sweat and intensity of every moment, and Christopher Rouse&apos;s masterful editing brings it all home.

Exhausting and thrilling, Captain Phillips is all the more powerful with the knowledge that you&apos;re witnessing a true story. Paul Greengrass and co. have crafted an experiential film that you won&apos;t be forgetting in a hurry.

I am impressed by this and strongly recommend the film to anyone who likes documentaries and wants to find out what these filmmakers think of their craft.

Mostly, the film consists of these interviews as well as a few clips of their movies. Many times, certain topics were answered by the filmmakers--and sometimes they disagreed. For example, one said that the only way to make a documentary is to film everything EXACTLY as it is in life--while Errol Morris (one of the top names in the genre) admits to actually creating the set used by the boss of the cemetery--digging the trophies out of the attic and arranging them to give the office a certain look. Another strongly objected to Michael Moore&apos;s style of films and calls them &apos;...crimes towards the art form of documentary&apos;. Even seemingly mundane topics as sound and music as well as the importance or unimportance of narration are discussed. It&apos;s like having a microscope that can peer into the minds of these directors--and it&apos;s interesting to documentary film lovers--though I could imagine it would be VERY tough going for the average person.",8,['Documentary'],['film studies'],2009-10-20,['Pepita Ferrari'],"['Jennifer Baichwal', 'Manfred Becker', 'Michel Brault']",[]

Carnal Knowledge,Chronicling the lifelong sexual development of two men who meet and become friends in college.,"Telling the sordid, often depressing story of two men and their sexual hangups over several decades, director Mike Nichols and writer Jules Fieffer concoct a thinking man&apos;s dirty movie.

How strange it went away, like a poltergism.

Casablanca,A cynical expatriate American cafe owner struggles to decide whether or not to help his former lover and her fugitive husband escape the Nazis in French Morocco.,"There is a scene about halfway through the movie Casablanca that has become commonly known as &apos;The Battle of the Anthems&apos; throughout the film&apos;s long history. A group of German soldiers has come into Rick&apos;s Café American and are drunkenly singing the German National Anthem at the top of their voice. Victor Lazlo, the leader of the French Resistance, cannot stand this act and while the rest of the club stares appalled at the Germans, Lazlo orders the band to play &apos;Le Marseilles (sic?)&apos; the French National Anthem. With a nod from Rick, the band begins playing, with Victor singing at the top of HIS voice. This in turn, inspires the whole club to begin singing and the Germans are forced to surrender and sit down at their table, humbled by the crowd&apos;s dedication. This scene is a turning point in the movie, for reasons that I leave to you to discover. 

As I watched this movie again tonight for what must be the 100th time, I noticed there was a much smaller scene wrapped inside the bigger scene that, unless you look for it, you may never notice. Yvonne, a minor character who is hurt by Rick emotionally, falls into the company of a German soldier. In a land occupied by the Germans, but populated by the French, this is an unforgivable sin. She comes into the bar desperately seeking happiness in the club&apos;s wine, song, and gambling. Later, as the Germans begin singing we catch a glimpse of Yvonne sitting dejectedly at a table alone and in this brief glimpse, it is conveyed that she has discovered that this is not her path to fulfillment and she has no idea where to go from there. As the singing progresses, we see Yvonne slowly become inspired by Lazlo&apos;s act of defiance and by the end of the song, tears streaming down her face, she is singing at the top of her voice too. She has found her redemption. She has found something that will make her life never the same again from that point on. 

Basically, this is Casablanca in a nutshell. On the surface, you may see it as a romance, or as a story of intrigue, but that is only partially correct.

The thing that makes Casablanca great is that it speaks to that place in each of us that seeks some kind of inspiration or redemption. On some level, every character in the story receives the same kind of catharsis and their lives are irrevocably changed. Rick&apos;s is the most obvious in that he learns to live again, instead of hiding from a lost love. He is reminded that there are things in the world more noble and important than he is and he wants to be a part of them. Louis, the scoundrel, gets his redemption by seeing the sacrifice Rick makes and is inspired to choose a side, where he had maintained careful neutrality. The stoic Lazlo gets his redemption by being shown that while thousands may need him to be a hero, there is someone he can rely upon when he needs inspiration in the form of his wife, who was ready to sacrifice her happiness for the chance that he would go on living. Even Ferrai, the local organized crime leader gets a measure of redemption by pointing Ilsa and Lazlo to Rick as a source of escape even though there is nothing in it for him. 

This is the beauty of this movie. Every time I see it (and I have seen it a lot) it never fails that I see some subtle nuance that I have never seen before. Considering that the director would put that much meaning into what is basically a throw away moment (not the entire scene, but Yvonne&apos;s portion) speaks bundles about the quality of the film. My wife and I watched this movie on our first date, and since that first time over 12 years ago, it has grown to be, in my mind, the greatest movie ever made.",10,"['Drama', 'Romance', 'War']","['nazi', 'love triangle', 'casablanca morocco', 'nightclub', 'anti nazi']",1943-01-23,['Michael Curtiz'],"['Humphrey Bogart', 'Ingrid Bergman', 'Paul Henreid']","['Julius J.

Lasse Hallstrom has directed a film which showcases the beauty of Venice in a romantic comedy that has beautiful sets and costumes. The ride in the hot air balloon is a cinematic moment which captures the adventures of CASANOVA and his attempt to woo the woman he really loves.

The dialog, pace of the film and the colorful ending makes CASANOVA a story worth watching and with a cast that is simply out of this world.

That this flick was committed to cheap, ashen filmstock is an immediate indicator that this was an empty-pockets production. Quite simply stated, there&apos;s a discernable messiness to the entire mechanical wheel of the film, yet it does manages to catalyze a shadowy, spectral veneer, and inject a few moments of trashy David Lynchian surrealism.

Cecil B. Demented,An insane independent film director and his renegade group of teenage filmmakers kidnap an A-list Hollywood actress and force her to star in their underground film.,"All you `movie lovers&apos; out there who are the genuine article, prepare to laugh  HARD! In `Cecil B. Demented,&apos; famed off-Hollywood filmmaker John Waters has turned his attention to a subject that is obviously near and dear to his heart, and, in fact, near and dear to the hearts of all true lovers of movies everywhere. In his latest wild comedy, he has tackled the seemingly irreconcilable conflict that exists between the worlds of big budget mainstream Hollywood moviemaking and low budget, renegade independent cinema - a conflict that the latter always seems unfairly and unfailingly to lose. Waters certainly knows whereof he speaks - he, himself of course, being one of the great pioneers and icons of the underground film movement. He launched his directorial career and made a name for himself in independent film circles way back in the 1970&apos;s with such crude landmark underground classics as `Pink Flamingoes&apos; and `Female Trouble.&apos; Since that time, he has himself received some heat from diehard indie film purists who have considered him something of a sellout for producing offbeat but decidedly more `commercial&apos; works like `Hair Spray,&apos; `Cry Baby&apos; and `Serial Mom, ` often with big name actors and actresses in starring roles. Yet, even with this more polished sheen, Waters&apos; films have always retained that quality of outrageousness and that willingness to push the envelope that distinguish his vision from that of more mainstream filmmakers.

`Cecil B. Demented&apos; is a particularly funny film for those who share Waters&apos; outrage at the mass audience&apos;s seeming preference for the bland unoriginality of much of the product churned out by the cinema factory known as Hollywood and its seeming dismissal of the cutting edge experimentation and originality that define so much of independent filmmaking. And he lambastes a money-hungry industry that is all too eager and willing to supply the public with the big budget, special effects-ridden pablum it seems to crave. Or is it  in classic chicken-or-egg fashion  really the STUDIOS that condition the audience into thinking that those are the films that they want to spend their hard earned money to see? At any rate, Waters&apos; clever parody follows a Patty Hearst-type storyline (as usual, Patty Hearst herself appears in the film) in which a group of bizarre, renegade independent filmmakers kidnap a Hollywood starlet (Melanie Griffith at her most likable) then force her to star in their reality-based new film which involves them filming themselves as they storm, guns blazing, into theatres that are showing putrid mainstream films, all in a righteous effort to bring commercial cinema to its knees.

`Cecil B. Demented&apos; provides a rapid-fire onslaught of clever inside jokes lampooning both mainstream and independent filmmaking. Although his heart obviously lies with the latter, Waters also can remain objective enough to skewer some of the self-righteous pretentiousness that occasionally creeps into that type of filmmaking as well (he even shows that, as a director, he is damn good at staging one of those slick car chases he professes to abhor). Yet, as this clever parody plays itself out, most of us watching the film can&apos;t help but nod our heads in amused agreement with much of what he is showing us. In addition to the jokes themselves, Waters provides amusement with his sharply delineated comic characters each of whom satirizes a different aspect of the renegade subculture. We have, for instance, the maniacal, fanatical, single-minded director (delightfully played by Stephen Dorff) who sees himself as nothing less than the messiah sent to destroy commercial filmmaking and erect a cinema based on iconoclasm and originality in its place. We have all his devoted followers who run the gamut from Satanists to porn stars to punk rockers to straight hairdressers to gay truck drivers etc. Without question, much of the zestful energy that propels this madcap film forward comes from the dead-on performances of the actors and actresses in these roles.

Energy and originality are in fact the hallmarks of this film from start to finish. `Cecil B. Demented&apos; may not be Waters at his most outrageous, but it provides loads of pleasure for film lovers who have been thinking many of the same thoughts that only Waters, in his uniquely humorous way, could effectively get across.

Centurion,A splinter group of Roman soldiers fight for their lives behind enemy lines after their legion is devastated in a guerrilla attack.,"Centurion is directed by Neil Marshall who also wrote the screenplay. It stars Dominic West, Michael Fassbender, Olga Kurylenko, Liam Cunningham, Noel Clarke, Riz Ahmed & Imogen Poots.

Britain, 117 AD and the Romans are struggling to contain the Picts in Caledonia. The Roman Governor sends in their best army, the Ninth Legion. But they are victims of a trap and are forced to flee on foot across the mountainous terrain with the vengeful Picts in hot pursuit. Can they stay alive and make it to the border?

One thing you know you are going to get with a Neil Marshall film is blood and guts. Be it squadies facing off against werewolves, pot-holing babes grappling with hungry Gollum types, or a secret unit sent in to quarantined Scotland to fend off cannibal punk rockers; Marshall likes to pile on the grue. With his latest, Centurion, he continues in this vein. Sadly that&apos;s about all there is as the talented director appears to be getting a little carried away with himself and forgetting to put some substance into his characters. What promises to be a telling historical epic anti-war movie ends up being one long chase movie. Only pausing for breath for intermittent blood letting and the now obligatory love interest sub-plot. Oh it&apos;s fun, very much so, and the visuals coupled with the excellently constructed fight sequences don&apos;t waste a penny spent. But as a whole it just doesn&apos;t work, it&apos;s more a collection of set pieces linked together by visceral pleasures under the guise of being a take on a folklore story.

However, there is no denying the commitment to the genre from Marshall. Centurion is often thrilling and brutal into the bargain, so as long as you don&apos;t require any semblance of depth then it will surely entertain you. While he has assembled a very admirable cast of British & Irish thesps and put them thru a very tough shoot up in the Scottish hills. The craft is there, from director and stars, just no decent script to flesh it out. Oh and do we really need Roman soldiers saying the F word to show us how hard they are? Coming after Doomsday flopped (personally I think it&apos;s a whole bunch of fun), Marshall is at the crossroads of his career. Once the indie darling of Britain he&apos;s been courted by Hollywood and needs to make big decisions. You can only homage so much in your favoured genres (here he nods to Gladiator, The Warriors and even Zulu) before it gets to be boring. So is it time to let someone else write now? Also if he must stay mainstream then he has to get the budget to do the job properly; witness the digital blood used for the first fight sequences, laughably bad and able to take you right out of the film.

At times ridiculous and over the top, Centurion only works well as a pure action flick. Which of course will find an audience. But director and cast are better than this, as an effective story is bogged down by lack of narrative heart that in turn is most likely hidden by arterial blood. Lots of it. 5/10",5,"['Action', 'Drama', 'History']","['legion', 'sole survivor', 'britain', 'roman soldier', 'woman warrior']",2010-07-30,['Neil Marshall'],"['Michael Fassbender', 'Dominic West', 'Olga Kurylenko']",['Neil Marshall']
Chain Letter,A maniac murders teens when they refuse to forward chain mail.,"This is completely pointless movie, one of those where you watch it to see what happens and then it just ends suddenly and you think WTF? Normally in slasher movies like this you&apos;d think the weakest points are the plot and the acting. Surprisingly, there was nothing wrong with the acting. The main cast did what they were meant to but the ultra poor script didn&apos;t have any proper development for each character so there was nothing much to feel for any of them. Even the premise of the story didn&apos;t make sense. A huge guy with a bandaged face sends out chain letter e-mails to people with the threat of death of they don&apos;t play the game. What the game is...no one knows because all the letter says is that if you don&apos;t play you die. There&apos;s no mention if you delete the e-mail you die or if you don&apos;t forward the message you die. This movie is that lame that a few simple rules aren&apos;t even scripted in.

Some of the deaths are truly gory, even by Saw standards. But in the grand scheme of things they are entirely pointless. Even the Saw scenes had some intelligence to the deaths- you&apos;re a bad person but you get a chance at redemption but not until you go through a trial by fire and lots of pain. The deaths in Chain Letter are just gore and pain. This makes watching any Paris Hilton movie fun and educational.

Deon Taylor should be made to undergo one of the death scenes in his movie- either that or threaten him with a scene if he doesn&apos;t stop writing and directing such rubbish.

Champions,"A former minor-league basketball coach is ordered by the court to manage a team of players with intellectual disabilities. He soon realizes that despite his doubts, together, this team can go further than they ever imagined.","LIKES:

Pacing Is Great: -The movie may move a tad fast at times, but at 2 hours it actually respects the story and grants you this incredibly fun and heartfelt story with good focus.

-It gives you plenty of jokes and builds on the relationships of the coach with the players, while also building things up and in a manner does it justice -Yet, it never lost the entertainment piece for me and that was a strong victory to have these two elements work well, to the point that I seldom looked at my phone to judge the time.

-And to do it all in one movie, well... that&apos;s sometimes rarer than diamonds in my opinion.

Handles The Sensitive Content Well -This is a movie about players with mental challenges and obstacles, so there is going to be some sensitive material that may rub people the wrong way.

-Some trigger words, stereotypes, and lives are examined in this and you&apos;ll find that keeping to this movie, you start to see this content shine in a light that really is amazing to see.

-How they interact, jobs, lives, and attitudes are all beautifully portrayed in this movie for me, but never dives too much into the cheese factor or essentially muddies the character in my opinion.

-Throw in the use of the low points in the story and helping them move towards progressing the plot, and once again you get this amazing opportunity to see this world come to life in a very amazing way.

-And to also not be too in your face with the topic, well... I have to say that was the biggest victory for me, again having the Disney aware speeches, but also not so much to be insulted or turned away, just like the 90s did a long time ago.

Story Was Laid Out and Planned -I&apos;ve said this many times, but the stories these days are either simplified, or take too many shortcuts to shove everything in.

-But Champions goes back to having a story laid out, having some organic layers to it, and doing their best to integrate it all in a logical moment.

-Seeing how he enacts the help of people, seeing how the players sort of evolve, and even more seeing the challenges are all logical, timed well, and resolved with very interesting methods that work both emotionally and comedically.

-And seeing how these all just build into this odd and quirky family really was so much fun and enjoyable to me, but never losing the evolution that the coach had with these people and more so the incredible level of building they had.

Acting Is Great -The movie is again nothing that is going to blow your mind with the most masterful performances, but that doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s not great for this reviewer -Champions starts with Harrelson, and he is such a strong pillar where his personality really meshes well with the content at hand.

-A vagabond character where sarcasm, snarky comments, and him being just Harrelson, this character allowed him to explore a little more of the acting spectrum and utilize his talents to a more engaging level. It&apos;s fun, enjoyable and again motivating and may have been one of my favorite roles in a long time of this man.

-Olson is energetic and a good counter piece to the mix. She has a bit more of the goofiness in the role, but as the movie progresses, the writers honed the character&apos;s qualities in and grant you this fun leading lady that added, not took away, from the plot and what she did for the characters.

-Matt Cook is more of the comedic relief, but he does it well, and still adds this touch of sentimental sides that maybe needed a little more time to be perfect, but still was much welcomed by my review and what he did.

-And the players themselves were on point, each one adding some level of engagement to the mix, making the movie fun, and yet never feeling insulted or faked out. That authenticity with acting really adds the spark to ignite that family dynamic.

The Comedy Is Very Well Done/Timed -This movie has lots of jokes and styles that will be amazing to enjoy on levels.

-Those with relevant experiences will capitalize the most from this movie, finding the antics of Johnny and the crew to be so relevant and familiar that you can&apos;t help but find it funny.

-And there is variety and timing that help further enhance the experience. Champions isn&apos;t just shoving stereotypes and insults in your face. No, it&apos;s smarter than that, and again uses simple timing, delivery, and character engagements to do the heavy lifting.

-With the variety of factors, and the natural feel, that comedic experience is just enjoyable to fans like me and so worth the investment.

Inspirational -Yeah, you know this movie is going to be like this, and I&apos;m happy it delivered so much and in some ways unexpected results that really added this fun atmosphere to the movie.

-The dialogue does the work, the nuances with music and filming, and then adding this engaging level to all the character development builds upon the story they want to tell.

-And then it just comes together at the end in a way that feels exactly how one processes these things that takes a realistic, and yet poetic tone.

-This component may add a tad more time to the movie, but trust me, it actually works with the themes of the movie, at least for me.

The End Credits -It&apos;s fun, fitting, and just full of the energy of the movie even though it pretty much adds nothing to the story.

-Champions credits are for those that just like to have fun, enjoy good music, and bring this family vibe back in one last moment, for an encore that works. Oh, and you don&apos;t have to stay until the end... it&apos;s more like a deleted scene component that you can check out later.

DISLIKES:

Some Jokes Go a Tad Too Far -There are some running jokes that aren&apos;t my cup of tea, but get hammered a bit too much -They are actually few and far between, but that repetition doesn&apos;t do much for me when it comes and sometimes a bit awkwardly forced in that didn&apos;t hit the engines for me.

-But again, there is more good content in this movie that it really offsets this dislike to me for the most part.

Predictable: -The movie has a twist and it does work, but it doesn&apos;t mean this movie quite stands out from the other sports movies that came before it.

-There are maybe two moments that get a surprise moment, but, it&apos;s a rather straight forward story that is going to most likely turn people away from this movie at the trailers.

-It&apos;s a fair point, but the journey is the fun factor to this film and think it again helps mitigate the simplistic tale we have going.

Some Tough Starts You&apos;ll Have To Get Through A Bit -In a sensitive topic like this, you know there are going to be jokes and content presented that can be hard to watch.

-Champions has a patchy start, but if you can make it past the material that shows the toxic world that begins this movie, you should be good to go for a great journey.

-That being said, there will be some trigger words, some behaviors, and maybe a tad insulting/sensitive stepping, but I implore you to stick with it and you&apos;ll get one of the more fun movies of the year in a long time.

The Basketball Moments Need Some Work -Hollywood makes some of the best sports moments, adding great music and makeup to the court to really give these engaging moments.

-It might be a realistic approach, and it might be true to the material, but, I won&apos;t like I wanted a bit more magic to the moment, which we kind of get to the end of the movie.

-And maybe adding some music, some coordination, and not rushing through the games as much as they do would have done that.

-The montage even feels a tad bland, and while there are funny moments, there are still other movies that do the magic better to bring out the full movie moments that I like in my sports films like Remember The Titans and The Big Green.

The Verdict: Champions turns out to be one of the biggest surprises by how much this movie does well in the grand scheme of things. This is no watered down, charity movie, no, it&apos;s a film that&apos;s got some bite, a lot of charm, and this engaging components that just really works overall. The film handles a sensitive topic well, with a pace and antics that make the film just fun to watch across the board and get a bit inspirational components in the mix. A pace that is engaging, characters that have buildup, great respect of the story, and an atmosphere that is just super fun to enjoy, this movie really did surprise me by how much I liked it. Sure, it still doesn&apos;t have the spark of originality, and some things are a tad rough in terms of jokes and terminology. But it&apos;s really only the basketball scenes I needed a little more tweaking the most to round out this film. Still, it&apos;s a feel good movie to check out in theaters for the sake of just a group movie and if you don&apos;t get a chance, check it out at home if you get a chance.

Charlie&apos;s Farm,"4 friends go camping at a haunted farm with an evil, violent history in the Australian outback - ignoring warnings.","The movie wasn&apos;t great by any means, but it was certainly watchable. The acting was pretty good for what the movie needed. However, after they&apos;re at the farm, two other people show up. I figured they were thrown in to be the first killed so the audience could have more time with the original four characters.

Charlie&apos;s backstory wasn&apos;t too bad. However, why did he have yellow eyes? lol. I can understand the crooked back, but the eye color was a bit silly.

Much of the movie happened as I thought it would, except for the end. I won&apos;t spoil it other than to say it was...not expected.

Tara Reid was pretty good in the movie, but she really does need to put on some weight. When she was crossing over the fence in the beginning of the film, it looked like she had no bicep muscle. She&apos;s a pretty girl and a fair actress, but she needs to take care of herself.

There is a bit of nudity in this. In Charlie&apos;s backstory, a woman is tied to a bed, and one of her breasts is visible. Later in the movie, Donkey is getting out of a lake, and his butt is shown.

The kills were...gross. So, if that&apos;s your thing when you watch this type of movie, you&apos;ll like this. I don&apos;t usually cringe about death scenes in horror films, but I did in this one. As I said, they were gross.

I gave this a 5-star rating. If you like horror films, and you&apos;re sick of the 1-star low-budgets that have awful actors/actresses, this will be a refreshing change. Mind you, it&apos;s not great, but it&apos;s good enough if you&apos;ve got 90-minutes to blow.",5,"['Comedy', 'Horror']","['australian horror', 'farm', 'rotting corpse', 'severed penis', 'tractor']",2014-12-04,['Chris Sun'],"['Tara Reid', 'Nathan Jones', 'Kane Hodder']",['Chris Sun']
Chatterbox!,"A young woman who works in a beauty parlor discovers that her vagina can talk, which causes her no end of trouble.","Chatterbox may be the strangest comedy I have ever seen.

She visits a psychiatrist to demonstrate her dilemma, and he comes up with the idea to enter show business. Dr. Pearl takes her on the road and she and her partner become stars by singing show tunes. Chatterbox is not graphic, but sort of soft porn with typically bad acting and a very cheap look to the camera work and sets. At seventy two minutes, it never becomes boring; so if you are in the mood for a light farce, and extensive nudity on the part of Ms. Rialson will not offend you, Chatterbox is a short diversion from the troubles of the world.",6,"['Comedy', 'Fantasy']","['erotic comedy', 'psychiatrist', 'sexual humor', 'exhibitionist', 'boyfriend girlfriend reconciliation']",1977-02-02,['Tom DeSimone'],"['Candice Rialson', 'Larry Gelman', 'Jane Kean']","['Mark Bruce Rosin', 'Norman Yonemoto', 'Tom DeSimone']"

Child&apos;s Play,"A single mother gives her son a much sought-after doll for his birthday, only to discover that it is possessed by the soul of a serial killer.","Child&apos;s Play is usually categorized with other definitive horror films of the 70&apos;s and 80&apos;s, such as Friday the 13th, Halloween, and A Nightmare on Elm Street, while it&apos;s a lot different, in ways I&apos;ll get into later.

Charles Lee Ray (Brad Dourif) is a serial killer who is finally killed by Mike Norris (Chris Sarandon). However, he performs a chant right before he dies. Karen Barclay (Catherine Hicks) is a single mother who works in a jewelry department in a department store. She lives in an apartment with her six-year-old son Andy (Alex Vincent), who is like any normal six-year-old. He loves the television show `Good Guys&apos;, and they have lots of toys and dolls that you can buy. When his birthday comes around, he doesn&apos;t get a $100 Good Guy, but Karen buys one from a peddler off the street for $30. However, that doll, whose name is Chucky, is actually filled with the spirit of Ray, who tries to kill everyone.

At times this can be pretty effective, even scary, even when they add to it with predictable, cheap scares. When Maggie (Dinah Manoff, who overacts throughout the entire movie) is slowly walking through the kitchen with no music, with the phone in plain sight, do you think it&apos;s going to ring? Thankfully, there aren&apos;t too many of them. The entire plot is pretty clever, not just a `Craven&apos; or `De Palma&apos; theme. Also, the puppetry of Chucky was pretty good, for it being 15 years ago. The cinematography was good, with many first person shots, which were effective.

Dourif, who played a gentle man in One Flew Over the Cuckoo&apos;s Nest, was very good, especially in the beginning, when we actually saw him. Why he isn&apos;t a big name now is beyond me. Hicks was good for what she was required to be: panicky and caring to Andy. Sarandon didn&apos;t do anything for me, as the obligatory police officer. Vincent talked like stereotypical movie children did, enunciating every syllable.

The music really helped, with it booming to prove its point of being a horror movie. It could have had some humor, like other horror movies do, to help it out some. Since it&apos;s less than 90 minutes and a horror films, they didn&apos;t worry about anything like plot holes or continuity errors. A few I noticed: how DID he go into Chucky, besides the chant, why would the Chucky doll be burned up, the dates continuously change. That scene with voodoo was very cool. That&apos;s about all I can say, so I won&apos;t say any more.

My rating: 7/10

Child&apos;s Play 2,"While Andy&apos;s mother is admitted to a psychiatric hospital, the young boy is placed in foster care, and Chucky, determined to claim Andy&apos;s soul, is not far behind.","So I watched the first Child&apos;s Play a couple of months ago. I hadn&apos;t ever seen it growing up, even though I started really getting into slashers when I was about 16. I finally decided to watch it, and had a perfectly fun time, but not much more. I hadn&apos;t had the desire to rewatch it, or buy it. That said, I did still have a slight interest in seeing this one. Today, I finally did...and I&apos;m really glad I did. I found this one more entertaining than the first one in every way. The movie flew by, and every scene I was intrigued to see where it was going. I found myself very invested in Andy&apos;s character, and seeing how he deals with the aftermath of the first one. I also found Kyle to be a really likeable, older sister type character. Between Chucky&apos;s one liners, the atmosphere, the pacing, and the acting, I was hooked. Not to mention the finale has an awesome setting.

Tang shan da xiong,A young man sworn to an oath of non-violence works with his cousins in an ice factory where they mysteriously begin to disappear.,"After years of trying to get into Hollywood, Bruce Lee returned to Hong Kong and began his efforts with this low-budget martial-arts thriller. The result - an Asian box-office smash which made Lee an overnight sensation in the East. Whilst its not a great film or Lee&apos;s best work, it is an definite film classic that really opened the door for the martial-arts genre, as well as kicking off Lee&apos;s career. The story sees Lee coming to work in Banghok with his cousins in an ice factory, where he soon discovers sinister operations taking place under the thumb of the title villain. Like Lee&apos;s other films, the action builds up through the film to impressively staged fight scenes, all topped by a dramatic, all-out climatic bout between Lee and the Big Boss.

Chisum,Cattle baron John Chisum joins forces with Billy the Kid and Pat Garrett to fight the Lincoln County land war.,"One of my favorite John Wayne westerns, Andrew V. McLaglen&apos;s Chisum, centers around the fact based Lincoln County land war around the late 1800&apos;s. This film features John Wayne in the twilight of his remarkable 200+ film career. Playing Chisum, Wayne&apos;s no-nonsense attitute fits the title character well. This time, Wayne is up aganist Forrest Tucker who plays Lawrence Murphy, a whealthy land owner who plans to take the town and then take Chisum&apos;s land as well. Chisum&apos;s neighbor, Henry Tunstall (Patric Knowels) also doesn&apos;t like Murphy&apos;s plans, and hires a young man to work on his ranch, his name is Billy the Kid (played by Geoffrey Deuel). Chisum, who has heard of him, doesn&apos;t exactly approve of him in town at first especially since Billy the Kid has an eye for his niece Sally (Pamela McMyler). Chisum eventually begins to like Billy right when he starts killing several of the town&apos;s deputies and Murphy&apos;s handymen, this is right when the war starts. Chisum has a handful of action and adventure sequences and wonderful cinematography by William H. Clothier and a fine western/adventure music score by Dominic Frontiere. The all star cast also includes John Wayne regulars- Ben Johnson as Chisum&apos;s sidekick, Bruce Cabot playing the sheriff who handles Murphy&apos;s dirty work, Andrew Prine playing Chisum&apos;s lawyer, Glenn Corbett turns in a fine job as playing Pat Garrett and Christopher George and Richard Jaeckel turn in their usual cowboy villians as the bounty hunters.

"L&apos;amour, l&apos;après-midi","Though he has an adoring wife, a bourgeois man is still tempted to pursue other women.","No other director has exposed, analyzed and interpreted love relations as profoundly and as maturely as Eric Rohmer. His cycles `Six Moral Tales&apos; and `Comedies and Proverbs&apos;, based on his own screenplays, are the best examples of how cinema can be at the same time `talkative&apos;, philosophic and incredibly effective. Rohmer&apos;s movies prove that cinema can fully explore love without being melodramatic, naive or predictable. `Chloe in the Afternoon&apos; (`L&apos;amour l&apos;après midi&apos;) is the sixth and the last of his moral tales and tells the story of Frédéric, a married lawyer who loves his wife but feels tempted to have an affair with seductive Chloe, a friend of old times who reenters his now bourgeois life. As in the case of many of his other films, Rohmer&apos;s screenplay is in itself worth-reading, with intelligent dialogues and interesting ups and downs in the love triangle, but his directing of the three actors, emphasizing their ambiguities (Frédéric&apos;s principles and impulses; Hélène&apos;s apparent self-assurance and hidden anguish; Chloe&apos;s solitude and tricks), is also very impressive. `Chloe in the Afternoon&apos; is a good reflection on the dilemmas of monogamy and the traps of possessiveness.

Chosen Survivors,,"One of the biggest challenges to movie makers is conveying the horror of nuclear war in post-atomic film. The reality is that shelter life isn&apos;t that glamorous if depicted realistically. The threats present aren&apos;t very dramatic and in most cases stealthy and lacking in suspense. The madness of nuclear war has to be communicated instead through contrivances, like atomic mutations or pervasive inescapable radiation like in ON THE BEACH. These things are not realistic but somehow they can often transmit the bleak and terrifying plight of the survivors.

CHOSEN SURVIVORS uses vampire bats to contrast with the serene tranquility of the expensive government shelter the characters take refuge in. No matter how safe they may think they will be, it turns out that the bats are determined to intrude in their sanitary environment and prey on them where they believed they were safe.

It&apos;s very effective for a low budget film. It is well acted and well directed and has an interesting score that complements the story. There are times you really feel claustrophobic and at the mercy of the bats who can penetrate even what they think are secure places.

The color scheme was pretty good considering it was accomplished before CGI filters existed for post-production and the special effects are pretty convincing as well. The somber blue shades over everything in the darkness combined with the lively shadows of the bats is very well done. The sequences of bats attacking is extremely well choreographed with the human actors.

This movie is a rare sci-fi gem with a bleak apocalyptic ending that is common for this genre of cinema but somehow satisfying. The movie stopped a little short of being a classic but is well worth viewing.",7,"['Action', 'Adventure', 'Drama']","['chosen one', 'two word title', 'survival', 'helicopter', 'scientist']",1974-05-24,['Sutton Roley'],"['Jackie Cooper', 'Alex Cord', 'Richard Jaeckel']","['Harry Spalding', 'Joe Reb Moffly']"

Chung Hing sam lam,"Two melancholy Hong Kong policemen fall in love: one with a mysterious female underworld figure, the other with a beautiful and ethereal waitress at a late-night restaurant he frequents.","There is something very personal and intimate about this film that I missed the first time I saw it. Chunking was recommended to me by a friend of mine whose opinion I value, so I tried it again - and I believe I got it.

Looking back on many of the romantic films I have enjoyed, I noticed that the main characters are usually women. Even those with men don&apos;t delve with any sophistication into the male heartbreak. As a result, I am not sure I know how to properly grieve a failed relationship. LOL.

Here the heroes both suffer from failed relationships. In the first story we don&apos;t really see anything of his relationship, we just see that he held on a little too long. More important than the relationship or the reason it didn&apos;t work is the aftermath and the acute dysfunction with which he approaches the next. In his first &apos;May Relationship&apos; he claims the failing was not knowing enough about her so he tries to &apos;get to know&apos; more about his new &apos;blonde&apos; love.

In the second story, the cop falls in love with a woman he doesn&apos;t even know. How about that for consistency of the way many of us dudes love? When we fall for women, we often fall for the idea of what they represent to us at the beginning rather than the reality of what she is. The shot that Wong Kar-Wai captured in the second cop&apos;s apartment in which the heroine hid on the wall in plain sight and the cop looked in the bathroom missing her completely was a fair characterization of the film. --- The male characters fell in love with the idea of a predefined woman and missed, in essence the women that were right under their noses.

Cisco Pike,A down on his luck former drug dealer is forced by a corrupt LAPD policeman to sell 100 kilos of confiscated marijuana in one weekend.,"Cisco Pike was Kris Kristofferson&apos;s film debut and it&apos;s astonishing to see him looking so young. He also provided the bulk of the songs featured on the soundtrack. He plays Cisco Pike, a recovering drug dealer and semi pro musician who can&apos;t quite decide which direction his life is going to take. Crooked cop Gene Hackman approaches Kris with the chance to clear his criminal record by selling Gene&apos;s purloined stash of primo dope. The balance of the film follows Kris&apos; efforts to unload the pot in one hurried weekend which finds him frolicking in bed with Warhol star Viva and porn actress Joy Bang, dropping in to the studio with Doug Sahm and the Sir Douglas Quartet, dining on fine food with Antonio &apos;Huggy Bear&apos; Fargas, and reminiscing about old times with his strung out old music buddy H D (Harry Dean) Stanton. Add Karen Black, Severn Darden and Wavy Gravy himself, Hugh Romney, and you have an amazing time capsule and a tremendously entertaining and well acted picture.

Citizen Kane,"Following the death of publishing tycoon Charles Foster Kane, reporters scramble to uncover the meaning of his final utterance: &apos;Rosebud.&apos;","Citizen Kane is majestic, elegant and noble. It begins at the end, we see a man of obvious wealth and power breathe his last, and then the mysteries of his life are unraveled via a series of anecdotes, barely remembered scenes and highly subjective memories. The boldness of this approach cannot be overemphasized. At the time that this film was made Hollywood was for the most part used to creating straight-forward stories with clearly identified heroes and villains. Kane dared to present Man as he is, rife with confusions, internal contradictions and uncertainty.

As the film progressed, we see Kane, loosely based on William Randolph Hearst, the famous newspaper tycoon slowly sacrifice his ideals in order to build his financial empire, losing his friendships with those who believed in him until ultimately he looses everything he has, his marriage, his friends, and his integrity. Though he is the richest man in the world he lives his remaining isolated in his privately built mountain estate where he has surrounded himself with material pleasures, alone and despairing, one senses that he welcomes death. The film takes the view that wealth and power are inherently destructive of human values. Kane himself states `If I hadn&apos;t been born rich I might have been a really great man.

What is so masterful about Kane is its ambiguity. We never are certain if Kane really did believe in the values that he professed. At the same time that he sets himself up as above the world, he longs for the affection of the common people. This is symbolized by his exploitative, and patronizing love for a chorus girl, Susan Alexander (Dorothy Comingore). Her character is given a paper-thin characterization, the only obvious flaw in a nearly perfect movie.

Orson Wells gives a bravura performance as Kane, both identifying with and condemning the man. This film was his first venture into movie making after the infamous War of the Worlds radio broadcast that threw America into an uproar. Wells, a child prodigy, had a background in Shakespearian theater, offering modernized adaptations of the Classics, a bold and unusual gesture at the time. He brought that kind of sweeping tragic romantic sensibility to his first film.

Unconstrained by Hollywood&apos;s traditions, he broke all the rules. The deep focus photography that gives Kane its theatrical look was one of his innovations. A mastery of sound, gained from years of working in the radio was another. Kane is an avalanche of technical innovation, unmatched in any other Hollywood film.

Despite the film&apos;s pessimistic outlook, it is studded by moments of joy, beauty and emotional truth. The supporting cast of characters, most of them regulars from Wells&apos; Mercury Theater are also superb. Joseph Cotton is memorable as Jed Leland Kane&apos;s close friend who believes in him more then he does. And Everet Slone is wonderful as Kane&apos;s would be mentor Mr. Bernstien.

So many scenes in this movie linger forever in the memory, one is left with a stirring vision of the frailty of the human condition, the film gives us no easy answers and while being fiercely critical of many of it&apos;s characters is universal in it&apos;s compassion and sympathy, this is perhaps the most vital ingredient for great art.

Kane was one of the most controversial films ever made. Hearst, offended by his portrayal, offered RKO a small fortune to destroy the film. When that didn&apos;t work his newspapers embarked on a campaign of defamation against Wells, thus proving that the film&apos;s criticism of the power and corruption of the press were precisely on target. Wells was never given a free hand to direct how he liked again and American Cinema was deprived of the one of the greatest geniuses to adopt it as a medium of self-expression.

It&apos;s influence, was immediate, incalculable and mostly unacknowledged, the film was a box office and critical failure due to Hearst&apos;s efforts and it was not until years later that this film got the respect it deserved. Nowadays there is not one living film director of serious artistic intent that has not been deeply influenced by Citizen Kane. It&apos;s not just a masterpiece it&apos;s a creative touchstone.

Of course there were other talents at work in making Kane, Hermann Mankiewicz&apos;s efforts on the script were indispensable and Bernard Hermann, the composer most famous for working with Hitchcock provided the films beautiful music. Still, the film remains most obviously the work of Orson Wells, a veritable hall of mirrors reflecting the great artist&apos;s dreams, obsessions and fears. Citizen Kane is not just one of the great works of cinema it is one of the greatest artistic creations of the century",,"['Drama', 'Mystery']","['newspaper publisher', 'rosebud', 'new york', 'narcissism', 'materialism']",1941-09-05,['Orson Welles'],"['Orson Welles', 'Joseph Cotten', 'Dorothy Comingore']","['Herman J.

City Lights,"With the aid of a wealthy erratic tippler, a dewy-eyed tramp who has fallen in love with a sightless flower girl accumulates money to be able to help her medically.","This is my favorite Chaplin film, but I don&apos;t want that to diminish his other work, either. MODERN TIMES was an outstanding work of social satire, THE GOLD RUSH was great slapstick, and even the largely-neglected MONSIEUR VERDOUX strikes a certain unforgettable tone. Chaplin didn&apos;t make a bad movie, and I&apos;m not even sure that CL is his best, exactly. But it IS my favorite, if only for the ending.

That ending has been the subject of much comment here. I think it&apos;s a masterpiece in a single scene. Chaplin&apos;s little tramp has never seemed less like a character and more like a living, breathing human being. It&apos;s a monument to understated sentimentality.

To me, the rest of the film exists largely to set the context for that one magnificent piece of celluloid. Yes, the boxing scene is great, and the scene where he rescues the millionaire is also wonderful, but it&apos;s that ending that makes us all love this movie.",,"['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Romance']","['slapstick comedy', 'pantomime', 'music score composed by director', 'the little tramp character', 'car']",1931-03-07,['Charles Chaplin'],"['Charles Chaplin', 'Virginia Cherrill', 'Florence Lee']","['Charles Chaplin', 'Harry Carr', 'Harry Crocker']"

Cloverfield,A group of friends venture deep into the streets of New York on a rescue mission during a rampaging monster attack.,"Some people have derisively compared this film to The Blair Witch Project because it was all told from the point of view of someone&apos;s shaking camera. Unless you have motion sickness, I don&apos;t think that&apos;s a bad thing. What matters is who&apos;s in front of the camera. While The Blair Witch Project featured annoying people screaming at each other, this movie actually made me care about the characters. In fact if it had continued with the romantic drama tone established during the first half hour, I STILL think it would have been worth watching and that&apos;s the biggest compliment I can give it.

Of course people will be watching this movie for the visceral pleasure and Colverfield delivers. Many thrilling visual and sound effects wowed me (there were a few times I yelled out in shock at a sudden scare). Any horror film will also benefit from a sense of entrapment and this movie pulls off the seemingly impossible feat of making New York City seem claustrophobic because there was seemingly nowhere to hide from the monster.

What is the monster? Whatever it is clearly is meant to be an allegory for the carnage 9/11 inflicted on New York, much the same way Godzilla was meant to be an allegory for the damage inflicted on Japan by the atom bomb. There are moments seemingly recreating the documentary footage from 9/11, and they give the film verisimilitude. Touching upon real life horror, plus creating characters that we can relate to and care about, and assaulting our senses with incredible sights and sounds leads to entertainment worth watching many times over. Perhaps the 80 minute run time will bother some people, but on the other hand I think that&apos;s better than a film wearing out its welcome. Great job J.J. Abrams and company!",9,"['Action', 'Adventure', 'Horror']","['found footage', 'gigantic monster', 'alien', 'video camera', 'monster']",2008-01-18,['Matt Reeves'],"['Mike Vogel', 'Jessica Lucas', 'Lizzy Caplan']",['Drew Goddard']
Clown,"A loving father finds a clown suit for his son&apos;s birthday party, only to realize that it&apos;s cursed.","Never again would I look at Clowns in the same way after seeing this movie but that get&apos;s me thinking, when did I like them in the first place.

The story to Clown is about a father discovers the clown suit and decides to wear it for his son&apos;s birthday party. However, he soon discovers that the suit turns the wearer into a killing machine.

Clowns never scared me because I always know it&apos;s somebody else in cheap looking make-up trying to make you laugh but really they creeping us out. I have seen many movies and TV shows with scary looking clowns in it and yes I can see why people are scared of them but they never took a big effect on me, until I sawed this and for now on I will stay far way from clowns if possible.

You can hate or like the film Clown if your a horror fan or not, for me I like my horror movies best served cold and freaky, and Clown to me isn&apos;t a bad flick. I can see a lot of effort went into the make- up and the design of the monster clown.

To those who have seen the movie did you think for a second that Eli Roth directed this movie, yes I know he stars in the movie but the movie has that style look to it that Eli Roth himself would use and I&apos;m saying that has a positive.

The acting in the movie was surprisingly pretty good from Andy Powers and Laura Allen. The directing as well was pretty good from other horror movies today. 

Normally I don&apos;t like over the top gore in movies as I think it&apos;s a cheap way to get 18 rating or if your American Rated R, and to be honest I didn&apos;t get that in this movie for most of the time you don&apos;t really see much of guts flying everywhere but most of the after math of what happened.

For problems with the movie I have some like: The characters in the movie are mostly forgettable and I&apos;m not talking about Laura Allen or Andy Powers characters, I mean the other supporting or the background characters that always seem to get screen time which they shouldn&apos;t because they stupid and dull to watch.

The movie dose have some clichés that really stick out and I thought we are already pass some of the clichés when it comes to horror movies today, but luckily after a while the movie forgotten the clichés as it went on. Oh remember when I said some of the acting was good well the kid actor was a bit noticeable that he&apos;s trying to be scared but I didn&apos;t buy it not for one bit.

Besides that Clown overall isn&apos;t a bad flick, now some people may not agree with me and that&apos;s fine you got a opinion and that&apos;s awesome I&apos;m not going to be like those dick heads that start yelling at you for nothing. Well I enjoyed this messed up movie.",6,"['Horror', 'Thriller']","['clown', 'birthday party', 'realtor', 'change of plans', 'father son relationship']",2016-06-17,['Jon Watts'],"['Andy Powers', 'Laura Allen', 'Peter Stormare']","['Christopher Ford', 'Jon Watts']"
Snow White and the Three Stooges,An ice-skating Snow White finds refuge from the Wicked Queen with the Three Stooges.,"As I lover of the Stooges, ice skating, romance and fairy tales, I was so thrilled with this movie that I plan to purchase it. While the amazing costumes and scenery and unique twists on the Snow White story would have been enough to entertain me, seeing the Stooges acting in tender roles make them all the more lovable.

The ice skating scene as Snow White lies crying in the snow is absolutely the most visually stunning effect I&apos;ve ever seen in a movie.

The only drawback to this film is that the Moe/Larry/Curly Joe combo never has the same magic for Stooge fans as the Moe/Larry/Curly or Moe/Larry/Shemp lineup.

Everyone in my family, even the 9 month old baby, enjoyed this movie tremendously.",,"['Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Family']","['the three stooges', 'princess', 'ice skating', 'prince', 'apple']",1961-06-21,"['Walter Lang', 'Frank Tashlin']","['Moe Howard', 'Larry Fine', 'Carol Heiss']","['Noel Langley', 'Elwood Ullman', 'Charles Wick']"

Cobra Verde,"During the 1800s, paroled Brazilian bandit Cobra Verde is sent to West Africa with a few troops to man an old Portuguese fort and to convince the local African ruler to resume the slave trade with Brazil.","Director Werner Herzog and actor Klaus Kinsky did many films together. They were all spectacular because of Herzogs direction and they all had an intensely insane looking leading man because of Kinskys solid performances. Cobra Verde was their last collaboration together because three years after making this film Kinsky died. He left a great legacy as an actor and Cobra Verde is a prime example of that.

The story is about Francisco Manuel (aka the Bandit of Cobra Verde) a bandit who goes from town to town looking for a strange new world. Basically everyone fears him because he is untamable, like a wild beast. One day, he gets a job taking care of slaves in a Sugar Cane field and he gets to live in the same house as his boss, the owner of the fields. Cobra Verde being the bandit that he is has his way with not one, but all three of the bosses daughters and gets them pregnant. The boss, looking for a way to get back at Cobra Verde for what he did, sends him on a mission to Africa to buy more slaves. Of course the bosses real intentions are to get Cobra Verde killed in the journey. What they don&apos;t know is that Cobra Verde is not a person who easily gives up and hes a tough cookie to kill. And so begins Cobra Verdes journey into the hot, deadly and colorful depths of Africa.

This movie, like many of Herzogs films is a journey into the unknown. I love how Herzog does that in all his films. Transporting us to strange places that truly exist, but are so wondrous and amazing that they have a surreal dreamlike feel to them. On Fitzcarraldo and Aguirre we went deep into the Amazonian Jungle, but on Cobra Verde we get to see the heart and soul of Africa. Once the movie gets to Africa (on its second half) things get really interesting and you will find yourselves completely immersed in the African culture. From the injustices of slavery to the savagery of African tribes. It was all new, strange and different to me because Herzog really went in there and found incredible real life locations in which to shoot Cobra Verde. Its as if Herzog searches out these incredible places, dives deep into them, and then brings them back to us via his films for us to enjoy. 

This movie is epic in scale and it shows in every single frame of film. We get hundreds of extras in many scenes. One particular scene stood out and its the one in which Kinsky trains hundreds of African women all dressed in their war attire and marching while singing their war songs. It was fantastic and epic and I loved every second of it. Not only that but its even more amazing when I learned that this huge looking film only cost two million dollars to make! I was unaware that a film of such grand scale could be made with so little money. Hollywood could learn a thing or two from Herzogs style of film-making.

Klaus Kinsky once again turns in an intense performance as the titular character. He certainly goes in a journey from being a bandit to becoming the king of an African tribe. I really got to like his character because he is a guy who literally does what he wants and has complete freedom over what to do with his life. Nobody tells this guy what to do, but once he sets his sites on achieving a goal (and its usually something pretty daunting) he goes all the way to make it happen.

Even when he accepts the responsibilities and challenges involved in going to Africa and taking slaves back to Brazil considering that slavery is almost completely abolished, he does it with a sure hand, ready to face whatever situations life might hurl at him. And Kinsky does all this with his own brand style, that crazy look the wild hair. In one particular scene in which he is training thousands of African women to go to war he goes completely ballistic trying to teach them how to properly handle a shield and a spear. 

I&apos;ve got a few complaints though, this movie has a few loopholes and unrealistic situations. I think a lot of it has to do with Herzog trying to evoke a feeling of otherworldliness and strangeness but in one particular scene Cobra Verde has to send a message from on place to another and he does it via thousands of people standing in line doing these secret signals with white flags and one person duplicates the message until it reaches the other person hundreds of miles away. This scene might lend itself for a beautiful and strange image, but its completely unrealistic! But I was willing to let it go for sake of artistic liberty. Another thing that grated me the wrong way was how one of the African kings spoke perfect English, as well as all his followers. The scene would have been a lot more believable with the king having a translator, but as it was filmed, its hard to believe that a king in the middle of Africa would speak English, and much less have all his thousands of followers understand him and cheer him. Again, a minor set back in a great film.

Like many of Herzogs films, the pace is sometimes slow, but when Herzog wants to amaze you he will. There will be moments of heavy dialog, and slow situations and then Whamo! Herzog will hit you in the head with something truly amazing. Trust me on this, this movie has many surprises up its sleeves! And you wont be disappointed if you enjoy movies that take you to strange new worlds.

Cockneys vs Zombies,A gang of bank robbers fight their way out of a zombie-infested London.,"I guess that&apos;s the best described movie title since Snakes on a plane. The movie delivers fully on its title and that&apos;s all you can expect from it, isn&apos;t it? A year ago Frightfest audiences were treated to a glimpse of some footage from the film. August 2012 the same audience (or whoever came again) got to see the whole film. And I&apos;d say it played pretty well with most people.

I liked it too. The humor is good, you get Cockney language thrown in a couple of times and one the slowest chases you&apos;ll see in any film. And it works really good tension-wise. Mr. Ford of course is a delight to watch and he must have had a lot of fun on the set. You can&apos;t and shouldn&apos;t take a movie like that serious.

Coffy,A sexy Black nurse takes vigilante justice against inner-city drug dealers after her sister becomes their latest victim.,"if you&apos;ve always wondered what was so great about Pam Grier, and haven&apos;t seen any of her movies from the seventies, look no further than Coffy. Coffy has it all, violence, pimps, drugs, nudity, sex, and it&apos;s served up with some severe camp and crazy dialogue. what sets this movie apart from other blaxploitaion movies is the excellent story and powerful performance of Miss Grier. I don&apos;t think anyone else could have pulled it off, and despite the low budget ambiance and feeling the movie took about a couple of weeks to make, Grier gives a performance worthy of her cult reverence.

the movie is a typical revenge story, with a not so typical hero-a black woman. Coffy&apos;s sister is hooked on smack and Coffy vows to herself to destroy the people responsible. Coffy works as a nurse by day, and prowls the clubs by night looking for the pusher who destroyed her sister&apos;s mind with drugs. Her search leads her to a pimp, a mobster, the cops, and a politician. In the end, she takes care of them all using her brains as well as her body, and damn do she have a body! Pam Grier makes this movie believable despite the obvious flaws of the low budget production. Her character never shows the weak side of femininity and fall into the ethos that women are at some point weaker than men. Coffy never breaks down to cry for help, waiting for a man or anyone else to help her-she does it all on her own. she kicks ass all over, and no other movie has done that with a female character, at least not anything credible. Coffy makes Thelma and Louise look like Laverne and Shirley.

Pam went on to make more movies of this ilk, but none were as popular nor as good as Coffy. what about Foxy Brown you ask? despite a better title, it doesn&apos;t compare to Coffy in either performance or content. Coffy served to bring Pam Grier into the main stream, as much as any black actress could be, and make her a star. all i can say is, thank you Quentin Tarentino for making Jackie Brown and proving her power and presence as an actress. See this movie, then see Jackie Brown, you&apos;ll see why Tarentino made it.",,"['Action', 'Crime', 'Thriller']","['blaxploitation', 'vigilante justice', 'social decay', 'female vigilante', 'organized crime']",1973-05-11,['Jack Hill'],"['Pam Grier', 'Booker Bradshaw', 'Robert DoQui']",['Jack Hill']

His performance is a study of excellent acting: He is so good as a reckless alcoholic pulling off acts of incredible chutzpah that the viewer literally cringes and winches in fear of his becoming exposed. Its not long into the movie that I was completely accepting of the lead character&apos;s complete asocial pathology. I accepted such for what it was - without any hope of redemption, rehabilitation or remorse! The problem with the film is that since the character soon becomes so one dimensional, the scenes just flow as episode after episode in a manner, way, etc., that makes one long for some personal epiphany, crisis, etc. This flick would have played well as tongue-in-cheek biography with a heavy dose of comedy, much like the films about; e.g., Ed Wood, Larry Flynt, etc. The movie might have been bettor with some modest introduction to the lead character, allowing some empathy.",6,"['Comedy', 'Drama']","['stanley kubrick impersonator', 'heavy metal band', 'reference to the new york times', 'implied sex', 'fashion designer']",2006-01-04,['Brian W.

The Conjuring,Paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren work to help a family terrorized by a dark presence in their farmhouse.,"Adequate and decent horror picture in which a family falls into supernatural terror filled with scary events , chills and lots of scares . Another creepy film in which keeps horror with yet another haunted house that causes creepy goings-on in a family such as the followings classic pictures : the original ¨Exorcist¨ film (by Friedkin) that spawned a wave of demonic possession movies that continues unabated today as ¨Changeling¨ (by Peter Medak), ¨Amytiville ¨(by Stuart Rosemberg) are two further examples of this sub-genre . Supernatural terror plenty of weird phenomenon , frights , scary beings , shocks , and eerie happenings . It deals with the Perron family formed by father (Ron Livingston) , mother (Lili Taylor , she researched The exorcist (1973) to prepare for her role) and five children move into an old house . Eight generations of families lived and died in the house before the Perrons moved in , but little do they know that the house is haunted . And some of the spirits from the families never left , deaths include two documented suicides, a poisoning death, the rape and murder of an 11-year old girl, two drownings, and the passing of four men who froze to death . Most deaths occurred within the Arnold family from which the nasty ghoul Bathsheba Sherman was descended . Paranormal investigators Ed (Patrick Wilson , this movie marks the third collaboration between James Wan and Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) work to help the family terrorized by a dark presence and ghastly mysteries in their farmhouse . There are three phases in this strange process : 1 : infestation , 2 : oppression and 3 : possession . They are attempting to find out the bottom of rare deeds by ways of the cellar and soon the poltergeists make their nasty appearance originating a lot of unusual rattles and creaks . The mediums seek to uncover the fantastic secrets that has left a witch dangerously connected to the real world .

This is a haunted house movie that contains restless horror as when the invisible and threatening beings attack . It includes usual poltergeists phenomenon caused by the scary entities with the ordinary ghastly shenanigans , the cracking floors , birds manifest as attackers , doors suddenly slam , screeching shouts , violent hitting , among others . Tension , creepy atmosphere , genuine chills , suspense is continued and appear lurking and menacing into dining room , hallway , basement and rooms . Great loads of screams , shocks , exploitation and terror abound with the usual poltergeists phenomenon caused by the scary entities . It&apos;s recreated with magnificent make-up and high grade plethora special effects which are frightening and horrifying the spectator . Based on real events , in fact Lorraine Warren and Andrea Perron served as consultants to director James Wan and the screenwriters , they both claim the movie is accurate to the real story of what happened to the Perrons during the 10 years they lived in the farm house ; as they investigated the Perrons&apos; Rhode Island farmhouse in 1973 and 1974 . The film was given an R rating by the MPAA . The MPAA said simply that the film was so scary that there were no cuts or edits possible that would make it a viable PG-13 film ; the filmmakers did not want to alter the film&apos;s tone and accepted the R-rating without any appeals . The movie broke box office records after bringing in a total of $41 million at the box office during its opening weekend . It stands as the third highest grossing opening weekend for an R-rated horror film behind Paranormal Activity 3 (2011) and Hannibal (2001). The Conjuring made a total of $137 million at the box office. 

Eerie musical score by Joseph Bishara creating a spooky atmosphere ; not only marks the second film composer Joseph Bishara has scored a James Wan film, but it is the second time he has played a demon figure for Wan , as he portrays the demon embodiment of Bathsheba Sherman and previously played a lipstick-faced demon in Insidious (2010). Dark as well atmospheric cinematography by John R. Leonetti who modeled the film&apos;s cinematography and atmosphere after vintage 1970s horror films. The film was well directed by James Wan and it was shot in just a few weeks . Wan is an expert writer and filmmaker on terror genre as he has demonstrated in ¨Saw¨ saga , ¨Dead silence¨, among others . James Wan also directed his biggest success ¨Insidious¨ equally starred by Patrick Wilson and similar technician team , cameraman : John Leonetti and musician : Joseph Bishara . And of course , it was followed by ¨Insidious Chapter 2¨ . Furthermore , producers are preparing ¨Insidious 3¨ and ¨The Conjuring 2: The Enfield Poltergeist¨.",7,"['Horror', 'Mystery', 'Thriller']","['ghost', 'exorcism', 'possession', 'haunted house', 'supernatural power']",2013-07-19,['James Wan'],"['Patrick Wilson', 'Vera Farmiga', 'Ron Livingston']","['Chad Hayes', 'Carey W.

Contact,"Dr. Ellie Arroway, after years of searching, finds conclusive radio proof of extraterrestrial intelligence, sending plans for a mysterious machine.","N.B: This is a very long monologue because I adore CONTACT to bits.

I loved the irony present in Contact, as well as its religious imagery and its attention to fine detail. To see the universe in that opening scene was breath-taking, and the reason for it all coming out of Ellie&apos;s eye becomes blissfully apparent in light of the end, for her journey was just as much a physical as well as an emotional and spiritual one. The photography was superb, alternating between expansive sweeps of the landscape and the universe, and close, intimate shots of the characters, symbolising the potential for the unknown&apos; as well as an equally important knowledge of all that is familiar  contact with our own people.

The irony manifested itself in how Ellie, who denounced Palmer&apos;s ability to possess complete faith in God, ended up being the advocate of such a faith, though of a different strand; she could now appreciate Palmer&apos;s passion. Remember that Biblical verse that when paraphrased reads something like: `The man who is not willing to give up his life will lose it, but he who is willing will gain it&apos;? This religious imagery correlates to how Drumlin lost his life in pursuit of personal acclaim, while Ellie, who admitted that she would freely give up her life in pursuit of life&apos;s tormenting questions, gained it in such a memorable and satisfying way. She found inner peace, having made contact with two intelligent races; one of the skies, and one of her own kind. The dried up cliché alluding to aliens: `We are not alone&apos; begins to take on a new meaning in a multitude of dimensions in light of this brilliant movie.

I read this wonderful blurb&apos; about Contact, and I think this following line delineates the film, and why watching Contact became such a defining film for me: `[Ellie&apos;s] personal voyage will take her beyond theory, beyond knowledge , beyond experience, to the realization that true vision is ultimately the union of fact and faith.&apos; This duality of life and true fulfilment which arises from the reconcilement of contrary beliefs is surely a theme of the film: evinced through the conflict created by science vs. religion, fact vs. faith, vision vs. reality.

Carl Sagan&apos;s novel was also a fulfilling pleasure to read. I thought that the message in pi was an absolutely crucial element of the book, the implications of such a message being that there is an all-powerful force&apos; behind the universe, which brings order to disorder, and such a force&apos; we might call God. So possibly, C.S&apos;s novel did prove the existence of God. Maybe the recurring C&apos; pattern in the film, (the quadruple&apos; system Ellie saw near Vega, the sands in her father&apos;s hands and that which she holds in the end), is indicative of such order  that no matter how large or small an event, i.e, whether a message is written in the sky or in the palm of one&apos;s hands, order is present, and implies a powerful force guiding the universe.

I am incapable of seeing many, if any, faults with this film  I truly cannot understand why anyone would think it contrived or the same as something as brain-numbing and gung-ho as `Armageddon&apos;. It is truly an intellectual film with meanings at many levels  and so thought-provoking! Perhaps Matthew McConaughey&apos;s representation of Palmer Joss was a little unbelievable, and the thrice-repeated `It&apos;s an awful waste of space&apos; phrase that connected Ellie to her father and Ellie to Palmer can be seen as a tad too sentimental on the one hand, but on the other, it serves to punctuate the potentiality of the physical universe, and the human mind, which, in C.S&apos;s case, conceived this book. Jodie Foster is magnificent, but then again, isn&apos;t she always? The extraordinary passion Ellie exhibited was admirable  her innate sense of wonder balanced by a stabbing loneliness, born out of the premature departure of a dear parent.

I love Contact because of its poignant humanity, the sense of wonder that resonates so strongly throughout the film and indicates the strength of that wonder which inspired C.S in the first place, and because it searches for meaning so idealistically, while still, necessarily, maintaining the sometimes harsh realities of life (personified by James Woods&apos; unsympathetic and skeptical Kitz).

To those who hated the ending, you obviously missed a crucial component of the film, that of possibility and potentiality. To have Ellie return with tangible evidence of alien existence would demolish all the credibility that Robert Zemeckis attempted to create by showing the current American president referring generically to the event of the message being discovered, the decision to build the machine, etc. The ending was crafted in such a way as to enable a choice by the viewer/reader to be made  just like how C.S equally respected those in his book who chose to pursue a path of science or religion. We, the audience, are allowed to decide what really happened, and this makes Contact an almost interactive and therefore a more intimate experience.

Contact has something to say to everyone, and has real meaning that cannot help but whisk viewers and readers alike to some thrilling place. To those who thought the film predictable, and had not previously read the book, I would say that you must be VERY creative if you managed to anticipate all that Contact had to offer. But for everyone who was as much inspired by this magnificent film as I was, here&apos;s the most important lesson to be derived from both the book and the film: `For small creatures such as we the vastness is bearable only through love.&apos; This enlightened message, dreamt up by Carl Sagan, makes me even more convinced that a book critic who said of Carl Sagan: `with terrestrials like him, who needs extras?&apos; is exactly right.",,"['Drama', 'Mystery', 'Sci-Fi']","['first contact', 'wormhole', 'nasa', 'religion', 'message from outer space']",1997-07-11,['Robert Zemeckis'],"['Jodie Foster', 'Matthew McConaughey', 'Tom Skerritt']","['James V.

Contagion,"Healthcare professionals, government officials and everyday people find themselves in the midst of a pandemic as the CDC works to find a cure.","People wanted a thrill. People wanted action. People wanted character development. Those elements weren&apos;t the intent, however. I&apos;d have to admit expecting an action from the marketing materials and the poster, but I don&apos;t judge movies over a preconceived notion or genre. Without throwing out spoilers, I was happy to see that it&apos;s more of an ensemble cast than a Matt Damon flick, considering his small role. Yeah, he&apos;s Gwyneth&apos;s husband, but so what? It was a good analysis on how our country, and the world at large, would react to a real medical epidemic. We saw a few overblown pandemics the last few years with H1N1 and swine flu, and I believe this movie is a what-if thought experiment on steroids. They even paid homage to the real world examples near the conclusion. Granted, the real world issues turned out to be media overhype more than a real medical scare and I believe the movie covered the media in a brilliant way. I liked this movie because it was a societal study rather than just an updated &apos;Outbreak.&apos; Regarding character development, there really wasn&apos;t a place for it in this movie. The only thing that touches it was the budding relationship between the two youngsters. On the other hand, I could, just as easily, write that off as a symbol of human strength, desire, and endurance since it survived the epidemic from beginning to the end.

Containment,"What happens when an epidemic breaks out, but you&apos;re kept in the dark? Anything can happen. Slowly the residents realize that they will all die unless they come together.","Small budget British film about a group of people trying to figure out why they are locked up in their flat. The answer to this will be painfully obvious from the outset and the film will unravel just as you will expect. However that doesn&apos;t mean it is terrible by any stretch of the imagination. In fact it is a pretty solid &apos;survivor group&apos; film with all the regular character types you would expect from such, so if you are a fan of these types of films then you will definitely find something to enjoy.

For anyone else there will most likely be a problem with pacing as it does seem to drag a tad, especially since it takes awhile for the film to reveal to the characters what we as the audience have figured out from near the beginning. There are also a lot of clichés that will seem tired and obvious, as well as possibly lazy.

Despite this there is nothing glaringly bad about the film, which to its credit works very well within its budget and keeps everything nice and simple so that it works and doesn&apos;t seem cheap or unfinished. Overall it is a good study for those looking to make a similar type of film as it is a textbook case of a group of people dropped into an unfamiliar situation where they seek to survive. As such it doesn&apos;t reach any dizzying heights or provoke much original thought, but it is solid and certainly is worth a watch if you are a fan of this sort of film.",7,"['Horror', 'Sci-Fi', 'Thriller']","['low budget sci fi movie', 'hazmat suit', 'pandemic', 'apocalypse']",2015-08-01,"['Chris Carr', 'Roland Holmes', 'Neil Mcenery-West']","['Lee Ross', 'Sheila Reid', 'Gabriel Senior']","['David Lemon', 'Neil Mcenery-West', 'Antony Woodruffe']"

I&apos;ve watched horror ever since I can remember, love it, all types, slashers, zombies, ghosts and so on. I graded this one with a 6, maybe a little more than I should, but it definitely has to be over 5, and I&apos;ll give you the reasons: 1) the plot was pretty OK, more complex than you see at others 2) characters were divert, one of that, one of this, pretty much natural people 3) dialogue: seems dumb sometimes, might be OK if you consider the nature of the situation each time 4) the ending: did not see that one coming, I for one thought it was heading to a different conclusion.

I actually was drawn into it, I will not criticize the fact that it didn&apos;t rely on gore, blood or nudity, always loved diversity. So, to this strange little movie, that shows how a girl can change over the days, I say: bravo! It was not great, but it does move you slowly to the edge of the seat.

It is interesting how they portrayed teachers in school. I am sure most schools have those characters! I did not get which subject a gay teacher does.

*** (out of 4)

Liam Neeson narrates this IMAX documentary taking a look at the coral reefs of the South Pacific. Underwater filmmakers Howard and Michele Hall try to explain the importance of the reef as well as explain why it would so damaging if Global Warming destroyed it. CORAL REEF ADVENTURE, obviously, is best seen on an IMAX screen but even on a smaller screen I think people are going to be entertained simply by the beauty of the subject matter. There are a few problems with the film including the fact that it includes a lot of preaching about the doom and gloom of Global Warming. I&apos;m sure if you believe in the great warming debate then you&apos;re not going to mind more preaching but as someone who doesn&apos;t want to be preached to constantly, the subject started to wear on me. One of the mixed things is that Crosby, Stills and Nash does the soundtrack, which includes a couple of their hits like Teach Your Children and Our House. The cool nature of their vocal tone really works nicely with the visuals on the screen but where the music doesn&apos;t work is when these songs are sung by some children. Those unfamiliar with the reefs are going to get a good history lesson on what they are, how they work and what diseases they help fight. I think it goes without saying that the greatest thing about the film are the visuals, which are just downright beautiful. The cameras get you so close to the action that you almost feel as if you&apos;re down there swimming. The vivid colors really jump off the screen as words can&apos;t describe how beautiful all the reefs are.",,['Documentary'],"['coral reef', 'imax', 'diving', 'fiji']",2003-02-14,['Greg MacGillivray'],"['Liam Neeson', 'Howard Hall', 'Michele Hall']","['Jack Stephens', 'Osha Gray Davidson', 'Stephen Judson']"

A Corner in Wheat,"An unscrupulous and greedy capitalist speculator decides to corner the wheat market for his own profit, establishing complete control over the markets.","D. W. Griffith was still finding his feet as a film director when he made this early short for Biograph in 1909, but it&apos;s clear that he was already emerging as a leader among the pioneering directors in New York.

This is quite a macabre parable in which an unscrupulous tycoon suffers an ironic fate after cornering the world market in wheat and boosting his bank balance by $4,000,000 in the process. Many aspects of the film are still quite primitive by today&apos;s standards - particularly the fraught scene in the trading pit during which nearly everybody overacts outrageously so that the viewer doesn&apos;t know where to look.

The cross-cutting for which Griffith would become justly famous is in evidence here, but it&apos;s interesting that, instead of using it to heighten moments of tension or suspense, he uses successive shots to emphasise the contrasting lifestyles of the ruthless speculator who drunkenly toasts his good fortune at a banquet with his friends while the poor working masses suffer the economic fallout of his manipulation of the market.",,"['Short', 'Crime', 'Drama']","['market', 'wheat', 'farmer', 'bread', 'loaf of bread']",1909-12-13,['D.W.

Corvette Summer,A high school grad and a hooker-in-training try to track down his stolen Corvette.,"This is a charm piece that depends on the chemistry and skill of Mark Hamill and Annie Potts. Corvette Summer never quite found an audience in 1978, but today it is a cult-classic among car enthusiasts, as well as Star Wars fans who are curious about what Mark Hamill was doing between Luke Skywalker gigs. Hamill plays a high school senior who falls in love with a car he&apos;s restored. The car is stolen, and he hears it&apos;s in Las Vegas. He hitchhikes to Vegas, and along the way meets Annie Potts. Her character is determined to make a career--whatever it may be--in Vegas. Hamill is funny as someone who&apos;s a know-it-all about cars, but naive about everything else. Potts is very funny as a girl who hides her brains and feelings behind an ever-changing mask and a series of one-liners.

The film features a parade of colorful characters, including a memorable performance by the late Eugene Roche as a downtrodden school teacher. However the actors take a back seat (pun intended) to the film&apos;s non-human stars, namely the candy-apple 1973 Stingray and the city of Las Vegas itself, which serves as the film&apos;s glittery backdrop.

"Count Yorga, Vampire","A couple invites a Count from Hungary, who recently immigrated to America, to conduct a seance for the woman&apos;s recently deceased mother, oblivious to the fact that he is actually a vampire.","When we think of great vampire portrayals, normally the names of Lugosi and Christopher Lee immediately pop into our heads. Robert Quarry, however, is as convincing a vampire as both of those great actors. His performance and demeanor as a Bulgarian Count in this film is truly outstanding. He lives in a large house somewhere in California and terrorizes young women and their boyfriends. What makes this picture a better than average vampire film is that it has a very tense and atmospheric plot structure. We basically know what fate will befall our innocent(just) protagonists, but we become riveted to their actions and those of the Count. Quarry plays the Count with a charm that is both amiable and yet caustic. He makes one of the wittiest vampires in film. The rest of the cast is adequate, and I think Roger Perry does a wonderful job as a blood specialist who goads Count Yorga one evening into talking about the supernatural.

Counterblast,An escaped World War 2 Nazi doctor impersonates a murdered English doctor so he can work on a vaccination to protect Germans in their planned germ warfare.,"I have to admit that one of my greatest cinematic guilty pleasures is the horror of the Nazi film (unfortunately, certain political trends recently in my neighbour to the south, the United States, make me unfortunately feel that similar ways of thinking have yet to be eradicated). Thankfully, being born as I was in the late 60&apos;s, I didn&apos;t have to experience such terror firsthand, but it&apos;s fascinating to see, through the wonders of cinema, examples of that fascist type of thinking, carried out to its fruition (some of my favourites in this area are quite controversial films, like &apos;Salo, or the 120 Days of Sodom&apos;, &apos;The Night Porter&apos; and &apos;Dr. Strangelove&apos;). At least in my estimation, I have no idea how I would have acted in either polarity of the situation: either being a German and told to act accordingly, or being a concentration camp inmate. I am simply thankful I didn&apos;t have to experience either horrific scenario.

This film was an unexpected pleasure. Though no star power is behind it, or budget to speak of, and though there is suspense and a good script, it could have been a lot better handled, both in terms of direction and cinematography (it has &apos;British 40&apos;s B-picture&apos; written all over it, while it&apos;s crying out for a capable helmer such as Sir Carol Reed, Sir Alfred Hitchcock, or The Archers, each of which would have made a minor masterpiece out of it).

In fact, someone in production borrowed the bulldozer vs. monster from 1960&apos;s schlock comedy Dinosaurus. But, in my book, the 80-some minutes isn&apos;t bad enough to rate among the truly bad, e.g. Manos: The Hands of Fate {1966}. Catch the photography, which is pretty good (of course, post- production bungled day-for-night, but that&apos;s not photographer Gentry&apos;s fault). Then there&apos;re the lush colors, about as vivid as any I&apos;ve seen. Add Cardella&apos;s sturdy performance as the take-charge sheriff, along with some pretty good stop-motion, and you&apos;ve got genuine compensations that lift results from the truly bad. 

Of course, the intended comic relief is pretty lame, along with a script that appears almost thrown together. But perhaps most disappointing is the utter lack of tension. Monsters should generate tension. However, director Stromberg fails to build suspense, which requires a better sense of structure than what&apos;s provided here. Instead, the production goes for quick shock, which itself doesn&apos;t work very well. All in all, the movie&apos;s too good to be truly bad, and too bad to be good.

A relentless and grim indiefilm, reminiscent of The Decent, in terms of tight spaces, part homage to Alien with it&apos;s creature design. It&apos;s a dark film with tight metal shafts, torch lit, choking soil filled tunnels as Tank and company try to find there way out.

Lead Nicole Alonso&apos;s performance as Tank and costume peaks interest, Torey Byrne and David Paul Baker are notable.The practical creature design deserve a mention being well hidden until the closing act. 

Given the nature of the film the dialogue is sparse and the sound design is effective. Director Oklahoma Ward&apos;s Crawl or Die (a.k,a Alien Crawl) is a slow burning low budget feature that will certainly disturb claustrophobics. It does a lot with its limited budget.

The Crazies,"After a strange and insecure plane crash, an unusual toxic virus enters a quaint farming town. A young couple are quarantined, but they fight for survival along with help from a couple of people.","A remake of the original movie made by George Romero in the 1970s, The Crazies tells the story of what happens after a highly infectious contagion finds its way into a rural water supply after a classified plane crashes and turns the previously down to earth townsfolk into violent rampaging killers – the &apos;Crazies&apos; of the title. First off it&apos;s fair to say that the new version of The Crazies is a vastly superior film to the original. The story is very well set up and generally builds momentum at a nice pace. You don&apos;t feel like you&apos;re being plunged blindly into the action. 

Of course the story isn&apos;t exactly new. While it still remains a brilliant premise and was no doubt unique in the 70s when the original was made, nowadays we&apos;ve seen this type of thing many times before. Movies such as Rec, its remake Quarantine, 28 Days Later, its sequel 28 Weeks Later and the Dawn of the Dead remake have saturated an already overcrowded market - with probably yet more to come. But while it&apos;s easy to say that the remake is just another in the aforementioned cycle of movies, it must also be pointed that when Romero did the original, he arguably invented a new genre just like he did when he made Night of the Living Dead: as well as &apos;the dead coming back to life&apos; genre, Romero gave us &apos;the killer virus that turns normal people into insane killers&apos; genre. The reality of the matter is by making those movies all those years ago, he was virtually inventing two types of story that would be mined again and again in later decades in everything from films and books to video games. If the aforementioned 28 Days Later is credited with the resurgence of the zombie flick, then it must also be acknowledged the debit it too owes Romero&apos;s original &apos;Crazies&apos; film: this is no zombie flick. In both movies the victims are not the walking dead, but alive and kicking, albeit completely insane.

While the production value is much bigger than the 70s release, the acting in the remake beats the original hands down. This is a movie with something for everyone: for the gals, there&apos;s Timothy Olyphant while Radha Mitchell supplies the goods for the guys. Playing the town Sheriff, Olyphant makes for a solid, likable and charismatic lead. Based on what he does here, surely A-list status and multi million dollar action roles are within his grasp. Similarly, playing his wife, Radha Mitchell brings a lot of gravitas and humility to her role and creates a very likable character. It&apos;s one of those rare moments of credibility – and good casting - where the chemistry between two principals is so strong, you actually believe they could be married in real life and because of this, you&apos;re rooting for them every step of the way while everything around them is going to hell.

There are two definite stand-out scenes in the movie: one set in a quarantine area with a group of people strapped to gurneys while a previously carefree towns person lumbers around wielding a pitch fork is chilling, while another, set in a car wash where every slap on the windscreen is to be feared, is relentlessly claustrophobic. These aren&apos;t just great scenes, its great film-making. The Crazies is a very well made film. Even the age-old and rather hackneyed &apos;no signal for the cell phone&apos; problem, typical in movies such as this, is solved very neatly here. Rather than having it as a throwaway line of dialog, it&apos;s worked effectively into the plot. Plus in another key moment that can only be described as jaw dropping, we get an overhead shot of a crashed aircraft in a deep swamp. For a remake, it&apos;s fair to say this movie has its share of surprises.

Another major plus is rather than telling the story from the usual teen perspective, the movie defies protocol and focuses on the adults. A refreshing change from the usual teen canon fodder, this is a smart move and makes it more than just another &apos;teens on the run&apos; flick. Also while we know the U.S. government is responsible for the crash and the subsequent outbreak, motives are still kept effectively obscure. No explanation is ever offered and the film is all the better for it. By keeping everything so murky adds an air of mystery and menace to the proceedings. One small criticism, though: the film opens with an unnecessary &apos;flash forward&apos; to a blazing inferno of a town where we see flaming cars. Clearly this is the aftermath of whatever disaster is about to take place because then we see a &apos;Two Days Earlier&apos; caption and the movie begins. This opening – brief as it is - does absolutely nothing to help the film. If anything it slightly lessens away the impact of what happens later because we&apos;ve already had that small foretaste. 

However that&apos;s just a small complaint. Overall The Crazies is a well acted, entertaining and thrilling roller coaster ride of a movie. Everything moves along at a nice speed and the running time is not so long as to outstay its welcome. It delivers a good deal of jumps and scares, and is entertaining from start to the finish.",8,"['Horror', 'Thriller']","['sheriff', 'deputy', 'self sacrifice', 'house on fire', 'barn']",2010-02-26,['Breck Eisner'],"['Radha Mitchell', 'Timothy Olyphant', 'Danielle Panabaker']","['Scott Kosar', 'Ray Wright', 'George A.

But while it&apos;s easy to say that the remake is just another in the aforementioned cycle of movies, it must also be pointed that when Romero did the original, he arguably invented a new genre just like he did when he made Night of the Living Dead: as well as &apos;the dead coming back to life&apos; genre, Romero gave us &apos;the killer virus that turns normal people into insane killers&apos; genre. The reality of the matter is by making those movies all those years ago, he was virtually inventing two types of story that would be mined again and again in later decades in everything from films and books to video games. If the aforementioned 28 Days Later is credited with the resurgence of the zombie flick, then it must also be acknowledged the debit it too owes Romero&apos;s original &apos;Crazies&apos; film: this is no zombie flick. In both movies the victims are not the walking dead, but alive and kicking, albeit completely insane.

While the production value is much bigger than the 70s release, the acting in the remake beats the original hands down. This is a movie with something for everyone: for the gals, there&apos;s Timothy Olyphant while Radha Mitchell supplies the goods for the guys. Playing the town Sheriff, Olyphant makes for a solid, likable and charismatic lead. Based on what he does here, surely A-list status and multi million dollar action roles are within his grasp. Similarly, playing his wife, Radha Mitchell brings a lot of gravitas and humility to her role and creates a very likable character. It&apos;s one of those rare moments of credibility – and good casting - where the chemistry between two principals is so strong, you actually believe they could be married in real life and because of this, you&apos;re rooting for them every step of the way while everything around them is going to hell.

There are two definite stand-out scenes in the movie: one set in a quarantine area with a group of people strapped to gurneys while a previously carefree towns person lumbers around wielding a pitch fork is chilling, while another, set in a car wash where every slap on the windscreen is to be feared, is relentlessly claustrophobic. These aren&apos;t just great scenes, its great film-making. The Crazies is a very well made film. Even the age-old and rather hackneyed &apos;no signal for the cell phone&apos; problem, typical in movies such as this, is solved very neatly here. Rather than having it as a throwaway line of dialog, it&apos;s worked effectively into the plot. Plus in another key moment that can only be described as jaw dropping, we get an overhead shot of a crashed aircraft in a deep swamp. For a remake, it&apos;s fair to say this movie has its share of surprises.

Another major plus is rather than telling the story from the usual teen perspective, the movie defies protocol and focuses on the adults. A refreshing change from the usual teen canon fodder, this is a smart move and makes it more than just another &apos;teens on the run&apos; flick. Also while we know the U.S. government is responsible for the crash and the subsequent outbreak, motives are still kept effectively obscure. No explanation is ever offered and the film is all the better for it. By keeping everything so murky adds an air of mystery and menace to the proceedings. One small criticism, though: the film opens with an unnecessary &apos;flash forward&apos; to a blazing inferno of a town where we see flaming cars. Clearly this is the aftermath of whatever disaster is about to take place because then we see a &apos;Two Days Earlier&apos; caption and the movie begins. This opening – brief as it is - does absolutely nothing to help the film. If anything it slightly lessens away the impact of what happens later because we&apos;ve already had that small foretaste. 

However that&apos;s just a small complaint. Overall The Crazies is a well acted, entertaining and thrilling roller coaster ride of a movie. Everything moves along at a nice speed and the running time is not so long as to outstay its welcome. It delivers a good deal of jumps and scares, and is entertaining from start to the finish.",8,"['Horror', 'Thriller']","['sheriff', 'deputy', 'self sacrifice', 'house on fire', 'barn']",2010-02-26,['Breck Eisner'],"['Radha Mitchell', 'Timothy Olyphant', 'Danielle Panabaker']","['Scott Kosar', 'Ray Wright', 'George A.

Viskningar och rop,"When a woman dying of cancer in early twentieth-century Sweden is visited by her two sisters, long-repressed feelings between the siblings rise to the surface.","In a perfect demonstration that horror and trauma are the stuff of real, everyday life and not the macabre vision of fantasists, Cries and Whispers marked Bergman&apos;s recovery as one of Europe&apos;s greatest film directors.

Like most Bergman films, Cries and Whispers is concerned with death, the suffering before death and the re-evaluation of life that death brings. It centres on three sisters: one dying of cancer, another trapped in a repellent marriage, and the last engaged in an uncomfortable affair. Moving between these three women is the maid, who tends the dying woman in her agony and, in one stunning scene, holding her to her naked bosom like a mother holding a child.

It is not, then, a barrel of laughs. Bergman films are not often for casual viewing, and I certainly won&apos;t be taking this one home to watch with my mother.

Like a great classical composer, Bergman uses contrast to enormous effect. Muted sounds which force you to strain to listen are punctuated with heart-rending screams from the dying Agnes. The colour scheme is a disquieting red, fading into pastoral greens and blues as the women reminisce about their younger life.

The characters also contrast uncomfortably. The two younger sisters, Karin and Maria, are sitting the deathwatch for their sister, but their task arouses no compassion in them. They are appalled and repelled by their sister&apos;s suffering, but they will not hold her hand or comfort her. The mutual dislike for each other is palpable. This contrasts with the simple humanism of their maid Anna  whom they callously talk about firing, once their sister is dead.

Set in the late 19th Century, the story flits intermittently between present and past, fleshing out the motivations and the stories of the sisters. One of these flashbacks confronts the audience with one of the most disturbing image in cinema, a repressed Karin cutting her vagina with glass to avoid sex with her husband.

Only a director of Bergman&apos;s calibre could make such a film riveting. Yet riveting it is. Bergman gets sensational performances from his four main leads; regulars Liv Ullmann, Ingrid Thurin and Harriet Andersson and a majestic, understated Kari Sylwan. To call this film Ibsenesque would be a slur on the originality of Bergman&apos;s vision. It is a testimony to his genius that this may not be his best film, yet it is one of the most striking films in modern cinema. I cannot recommend it highly enough. 9/10.",9,['Drama'],"['looking at oneself in a mirror', 'the color red', 'period drama', 'mansion', 'maid']",1973-03-05,['Ingmar Bergman'],"['Harriet Andersson', 'Liv Ullmann', 'Kari Sylwan']",['Ingmar Bergman']
Crimson Peak,"In the aftermath of a family tragedy, an aspiring author is torn between love for her childhood friend and the temptation of a mysterious outsider.

While Crimson Peak does not come anywhere near the quality of Labyrinth in terms of the script, it still showcases del Toro&apos;s unique skill for beauty and suspense.

The sets, costumes and general atmosphere are sumptuous in that signature del Toro way. The luxurious train on the heroine&apos;s robe that audibly thumps behind her as she sweeps down the staircase? Yes, please. There is a nod to all the images our minds ever conjured while reading fairy tales. The rich colors, the music, the textures all help draw us in to this world and settle us in for the story.

The film is not without its flaws. There are a few glaring plot contrivances that had me groaning. There is a superficial quality to the scenes involving Thomas Sharpe&apos;s clay mining business.

I was impressed with Jessica Chastain&apos;s talent for conveying two conflicting emotions at once, all playing out on her face, reminiscent of Gillian Anderson in Bleak House.",7,"['Drama', 'Horror', 'Mystery']","['incest', 'ghost', 'gothic', 'loss of mother', 'brother sister incest']",2015-10-16,['Guillermo del Toro'],"['Mia Wasikowska', 'Jessica Chastain', 'Tom Hiddleston']","['Guillermo del Toro', 'Matthew Robbins']"

The Prince and the Pauper,,"Nice adaptation from Mark Twain&apos;s classic also titled ¨Crossed Swords¨ with a top-of-the range cast . It&apos;s a Richard Fleischer&apos;s gorgeous film plenty of action , costumed adventure , humor , swashbuckling and lots of entertainment . The movie is very amusing and funny , capturing the flavor of the old times . On the same day two boys cross their fates : the pauper Tom and prince Edward (Mark Lester in double tole) . As a street beggar, Tom flees from pursuers and sneaks into the palace garden and meets the King Henry VIII (Charlton Heston) . Later on , the pickpocket Tom meets prince Edward VI , they change clothes with each other but the guards discover them and throw out the prince, since they are almost identical. Nobody believe them when they try to tell the truth and the young prince has trouble reclaiming his crown. Soon after, the old king dies and the prince will inherit the throne. The young prince turned beggar is aided by a swashbuckling soldier-of-fortune ( Oliver Reed who steals the spectacle as intrepid adventurer ) .

The flick deals about the Prince Edward VI ,son of Henry VIII of England, who&apos;s replaced by a beggar and vice versa . The film mingles comedy, adventures, humor, tongue-in-check and history. The starring boy is excellent and Oliver Reed as the preceptor is sublime. Also are splendidly, the supporting roles : Rex Harrison , Harry Andrews , Charlton Heston , Ernest Borgnine , David Hemmings , George C Scott , all are magnificent , including Raquel Welch. In the movie appears several historical characters, such as Henry VIII, Edward VI , Duke of Norfolk , and Lady Jane, princess Elizabeth , both of whom will be queens.

This is still one of the best versions along with the starred by Errol Flynn. This entertaining movie should satisfy young and old .

Similar at this point to another (better) Price vehicle from around this time called The Conqueror Worm. But the similarities end there as the main plot is about some witches summoning a demon or something to seek revenge on Price and his wicked children. No banshees to be found.

The Cyclops,An expedition to Mexico finds and does battle with a mutated 25-foot man with one big eye.,"The Cyclops

The upside to being 50-feet tall is you can make money just by standing outside car dealerships waving.

However, the mutated features of the colossus in this horror movie might scare off customers.

When Susan&apos;s (Gloria Talbott) test pilot boyfriend Bruce (Duncan Parkin) crashes over a mysterious area of Mexico, she hires a pilot (Tom Drake) to take her, a scientist (James Craig) she just met and a shady mining consultant (Lon Chaney Jr.) to the cursed region where gargantuan creatures are rumoured to dwell.

Unfortunately Susan&apos;s rescue party is more interested in harvesting the radium that turned Bruce into a mindless Cyclops than in helping her subdue him.

Just one of many radioactive giant B-movies released in the 1950s, what sets this black-and-white jungle adventure apart is the Cyclops&apos; unforgettable design and Lon Chaney&apos;s drunken performance.

Incidentally, a thoughtful gift for a giant is a hot air balloon poncho. Yellow Light

The Dancer Upstairs,,"Very closely based on Guzman and the Shining Path Maoist terrorists in Peru, this movie is compulsive viewing.

The plot is fairly standard good cop tracks down bad guys - there are no bonus points for this plot. Indeed, some of the coincidences that arise as the film goes on are the weakest link in this otherwise near-flawless movie.

There has been much talk about the violent scenes in this movie, which are many, but especially the scenes with animals. My view is that it is no more morally wrong to depict violence to animals than it is to depict violence to humans, as long as no animal (or human) is actually harmed in making the depiction. We are told that none of the animals were harmed in the making of the film (and presumably also none of the people). As far as I am concerned that is the end of that matter - the use of animals, unhamred, for this purpose is acceptable. To argue otherwise I find, frankly, daft. However, I would recommend that people who get particularly upset when violence to animals is depicted should simply avoid this movie.

Dark Floors,A man emerges with his autistic daughter and three others from a hospital elevator to find themselves trapped in the building with devilish monsters.,"I got to say that i went to see this movie with low expectations. I didn&apos;t believe that a Lordi movie could be good because i actually couldn&apos;t imagine it as a whole. Though, after i saw the movie i was amazed at how well the writers and the director pulled it off.

It is often said that horror is the most delicate type of movie because there is only a slight difference between scary and ridiculous. but this doesn&apos;t concern Dark Floors because it is not (atleast in my mind) a full blooded horror movie. The movie has many horror elements but doesn&apos;t still come off as horrorish. That doesn&apos;t make it bad it just means that you can&apos;t go in to the theater wishing that you will be scared out of your nickers.

The visual and audio feel of the movie was excellent all the way and there is nothing anyone can say about that. The plot did leave a annoying amount of plot holes and the ending didn&apos;t really clear any of them up and the viewer was just left to quess what the plot was all about. Still it didn&apos;t bother half as much as the under use of the Lordi band members. I have never liked Lordi and never listened to them but while watching this movie i became interested in the different monsters they play. Sadly, the plot did hardly nothing at all to use the unique backgrounds and looks of the different ghoul part from the different superpowers they all demonstrated. What i am saying is that i would have liked this movie to be more about the monsters than the victims... really who gave a goddamn thing for what happened to the all knowing copper or the businessman type. The only character i got even a bit curious was the weird hobo with superpowers and a weird telepathic relationship with the girl but he is never explained in any way(a big mistake).

In retrospect i think they could have done a lot more better but i also think that there is a lot of good in this film also and i hope it will be a success financially.

A Dark Song,A determined young woman and a damaged occultist risk their lives and souls to perform a dangerous ritual that will grant them what they want.,"Very slow-moving horror that plays its cards very close to its chest, heightened by some fine acting. Basically, a two-piece featuring the fractious relationship between posh Sophia (Catherine Walker) and coarse Joseph Solomon (Steve Oram); these two sharply written (writer Liam Gavin, who also directs, is clearly a name to look out for), beautifully played characters carry most of the film.

Maybe we have to wait a little too long for things to start happening, but we won&apos;t get as frustrated about it as Sophia, who gets very angry indeed. This is a good, claustrophobic chiller rather than a fully-fledged horror a lot of the time, although the events toward the end take on a much more gruesome nature. I thoroughly enjoyed this.

Dark Star,"In the far reaches of space, a small crew, 20 years into their solitary mission, find things beginning to go hilariously wrong.","It all started out as a short film made at film school made by the now legendary John Carpetenter, but then they wanted to make a longer version, however they couldn&apos;t get money to remake it, so they simply added extra scenes in the middle (example, the beach ball alien).

The story is this, on a ship where the captain is dead (but you can unfreeze to ask him questions) and the rest crew are going basically crazy they have problem. One of their bombs has become sentient and is busy contemplating the nature of existence.

The effects are OK, and who would have thought the beach ball would become the inspriration for the movie Alien. 

Over all one of the great classics of science fiction and of low budget film making. 

I heard of this movie a long time ago and it took me over 10 years before I finally found it in my local video shop. Great and amazing movie.

Darling,Beautiful but amoral model Diana Scott sleeps her way to the top of the London fashion scene at the height of the Swinging Sixties.,"This is a breakthrough film depicting what a female with a fairy tale-like upbringing experiences when she gets into the real world. Julie Christie is magnificent as the free-spirited, swinging role model for women everywhere. She has men falling right and left for her and even promises of wealth beyond imagination. But her unfulfilment is perfectly depicted in this daring and innovative film. She falls for a famous dashing tele-journalist, but realises soon enough that she is no match for his brain. She falls for a slick and smarmy executive, hoping to find her place with the jet set. She sees the shallowness of that existence soon enough! She does eventually find some taste of fame and is swept away to Capri, one of the most romantic and beautiful spots in the world. But there she sees only the shallow reflection of her outer beauty when confronted with the deeper beauty of elderly women praying with grace and humility at a local church. She does also manage to meet a prince who wants to marry her. He gives her wealth, a title, an enormous glamourous estate, a tailor-made family (from a previous marriage) and his deepest admiration. Unfortunately, his admiration is no more deep for her than it might be for his prize horse or Rolls Royce. She has everything but love.

The film has much to say about the illusions of glamour that women are compelled to fulfil. They are compelled to fulfil those illusions because they never had an inkling that there could be anything else. Women could rub shoulders (and other body parts) with men of brilliance, of power, and of wealth, but their own surface existence could never be a match. The film is essentially a tragi-comedy, for beneath the delightful exterior of the film is the harsh reality that a surface life is no match for a life with purpose.

This film is also amazing because it is one of the few films that actually shows characters living in a real world, not just a world that revolves around the characters. Schlesinger fills the screen with a myriad of realities. The man on the street pontificating his views on city life, a famous author, celebrities, bohemians, a gay photographer who is not traumatised about what he is, and even that great symbol of solid innocence - the elderly woman feeding the pigeons at Picadilly Circus, they are all essentially equal in importance. We in fact are mainly introduced to Christie&apos;s character as she is plucked out of the street in an indiscriminate interview. She is much a product of the world as anyone else.

The film is still timely today, since there are still so many women who cling to the images and myths of ideal womanhood (ie: an illusion without soul or intelligence). All the performances are smashing. And yes, it is true, that swinging sixties feel is irresistible!",,"['Drama', 'Romance']","['swinging london', 'social climber', 'self destructiveness', 'upper class', 'independent film']",1965-08-03,['John Schlesinger'],"['Julie Christie', 'Dirk Bogarde', 'Laurence Harvey']","['Frederic Raphael', 'John Schlesinger', 'Joseph Janni']"

Les lèvres rouges,"While passing through a vacation resort, a newlywed couple encounters a mysterious, strikingly beautiful countess and her aide.","Beware as you go into this, it may sound like Hammer but it&apos;s nothing like it. It&apos;s a chic, stylish vampire film dripping with the most wanton aestheticism. The whole thing exudes the scent of an absinthe dream, the contours of a flowing red dress.

Superficially it is about a couple of newly-weds - but who, as the film opens with them having sex in a train cabin, openly declare that they don&apos;t love each other - who find themselves stranded in Ostande and move in to a strangely empty hotel for a few days. A countess Bathory arrives there with her female companion, there&apos;s also the baffled concierge who tries to stay out of passion&apos;s way.

I say superficially because the dynamics between the couple is what at first sight seems to be driving the story. The woman is desperate to break out from the limbo of anonymous sex and be introduced, thus be legitimized as a wife and woman, to the man&apos;s mother, an aristocrat back in England. The man, on the other hand, is content to derail those expectations and savour the erotic dream he has concocted to inhabit.

But of course we come to understand that the narrative is powered from outside. The countess courts both, seducing in the emotional space between them. She personifies that wanton aestheticism right down to her body language. It is important to note that she is played by the actress who starred in Marienbad for Resnais, which this film alludes to; in the mysterious hotel setting with its expansive balustrades, in the twilight wanderings, in the sense of time revoked and sensations amplified.

She is the architect of all this, building around these people the desires that will yield them to her. So it is the man&apos;s semi-conscious world of secret pleasures, but it&apos;s she who is slowly, slyly perverting them. She does this with the malevolent purity of a femme fatale.

It does not matter that she is Bathory, or that blood is eventually savored from wrists, this is merely the desire made visible in a way that would appeal to a niche audience. So even though Jess Franco borrowed the velvety sunsets and decadent air from this for Vampyros Lesbos, this operates deeper. It matters for example that she seduces the man into a new obsession with violence, the destructive flipside of eros. It further pries the woman apart from him.

Gradually what was a matter of taking pleasure from flesh is spun into something else entirely; again involving flesh but now literally draining from his.

It ends with a stunning sequence across countryside roads; a lot of the imagery recalls L&apos;Herbier - who also inspired Resnais - but here more pertinently. The soul has been so withered away from inside, so consumed from the fever of passion, that mere sunlight sends it reeling. Of course we can explain away by falling back to our knowledge of vampire lore, but we&apos;d be missing on the finer abstractions; how, for example, the femme fatale is magically cast into the circumstances that, as we know from our knowledge of this type of film, would precipitate her demise. Nothing else would do after all.

If we follow the set of reactions from what at first sight appears like an accident, it can be plainly seen how it all flows from her desire to control the narrative.

It&apos;s marvelous stuff just the same, the colors, the desolate aura. I just want to urge you to see as more than just an &apos;artsy vampire flick&apos;.

The Day After Tomorrow,"Jack Hall, paleoclimatologist, must make a daring trek from Washington, D.C. to New York City to reach his son, trapped in the cross-hairs of a sudden international storm which plunges the planet into a new Ice Age.","The Day After Tomorrow is not a bad movie by all means. In fact, it&apos;s an uneven but decent film. The film does start off absolutely brilliantly, with a wonderful idea for a story and truly spectacular special effects. As a matter of fact, the whole film is well worth watching for the special effects alone. The acting is not too bad; Jake Gyllanhaal is rather bland, but Dennis Quaid is a superb lead. Plus Emmy Rosum looks positively radiant and Ian Holm is as reliable as ever. The direction from Roland Emmerich was surprisingly good, there have been times when I have found his direction too murky and unfocused, but no it was above decent here.

However, the second half isn&apos;t as impressive. Whereas the first half is very like a typical disaster movie, the second half for me as it focused on the rescue mission felt more of a thriller. The screenplay in general could have done with more precision and focus too, there is good interplay sometimes but on the whole I found the screenplay and some of the characters underdeveloped. My main problem though with The Day After Tomorrow was the pace, for my liking it was too leisurely and too stodgy.

All in all, uneven it is but it is a decent disaster movie. The first half I can watch again and again, but the second half for me was a bit of a letdown. 7/10 Bethany Cox",7,"['Action', 'Adventure', 'Sci-Fi']","['global warming', 'end of the world', 'climate crisis', 'climate', 'weather']",2004-05-28,['Roland Emmerich'],"['Dennis Quaid', 'Jake Gyllenhaal', 'Emmy Rossum']","['Roland Emmerich', 'Jeffrey Nachmanoff']"

The Dead Don&apos;t Die,The peaceful town of Centerville finds itself battling a zombie horde as the dead start rising from their graves.,"All the ingredients to produce a masterpiece are present: 1) A director I love, Jim Jarmusch, due to the excellent Paterson (2016) and Broken Flowers (2005). 2) A to-die-for cast, with Bill Murray in particular. 3) A sens of humor that regularly flirts with the absurd, including wacky and irreverent dialogues like « a black coffee please, but not too black » for instance. 4) The mesmerizing voice of Tom Waits. 5) A slight criticism of our society, especially the progressive global warming because of a strong procrastination with regard to the respect of our environment, and, albeit to a lesser extent, consumerism. 6) Zombies! I may confess that I have a crush on zombies. 7) ...

So, all the ingredients are lumped together but, it&apos;s quite strange and even weird, the recipe is rather unsuccessful: the atmosphere is sometimes cutesy or even insipid, the characters are usually devoid of enthusiasm and quite often apathetic, and the final scene rhymes with bitterness and bewilderment.

Although the film is not completely lousy thanks to a few successful scenes, I was globally bored and disappointed.

Dead Men Don&apos;t Wear Plaid,Film noir parody with a detective uncovering a sinister plot. Characters from real noirs appear as scenes from various films are intercut.,"An incredible achievement. My mind boggles at the amount of thought, time and effort that must have gone into this superb film. The plot is brilliantly and hilariously convoluted, with screen legends from the 1940s making appearances in amazingly edited scenes, and Steve Martin&apos;s trademark absurd humour is present almost all the way. Steve and Rachel Ward have remarkable chemistry, and each of their performances are highly impressive. If it weren&apos;t for the bundles of humour employed, one would almost think at times that this actually is a film noir from the 1940s, so legitimate and believable is the &apos;feel&apos; or the atmosphere of the film.

I cannot believe that some people who commented on this film have said that the plot is merely an excuse to hang old movie clips onto, and not much use at all; and the person who claims that Steve Martin overacts in this movie mustn&apos;t realise that this is regarded as one of Steve&apos;s more restrained, deadpan comedic performances (the &apos;cleaning woman!&apos; device turns out to be an important part of the plot and also seems to be a way of using the strangling scene that is taken from the Bette Davis movie - it is also a chance for Steve to get in a very tiny element of his &apos;wild and crazy guy&apos; persona, which he substituted with a more suitable [for parody] &apos;straight&apos; performance).

This film cash&apos;s in on a very popular theme of the time, Zucco plays both the Vampire (Elwyn) and the likable Doctor (his brother).

The idea is not new to the horror genre but the setting and main situation driving the narrative is different. The biggest issue is that they give away too much of the twist early on so that the big reveal is not a revelation at all but just a well duh moment. The acting is mixed and the female lead who plays Mouse is the strongest of the four. The special effects rely too much on CGI which seems take away from the creepiness, what ever happened to good old low budget horrors using practical effects? The jump scares full flat due to this lack of tension and creepiness.

The Dead Room,"When a terrified family flees a desolate southern New Zealand farmhouse, two cynical scientists and a young psychic are sent to investigate their claims of a haunting.

More often than not, it seems horror producers take it for granted that the plot consists of illogical supernatural things happening and people dying in gory yet cinematic ways. To this end, very little is done to give the story or the characters any heart.

This movie does just that. It has an innocent story of three ghostbusters investigating a haunted house. The characters are, not only NOT obnoxious but downright likable. I could watch 90 minutes of this even if nothing spooky happened because they managed to keep my attention and were thoroughly well fleshed out.

It&apos;s not very scary, but it gives you the delicious little glee of watching one of those &apos;spooky phenomenon&apos; movies. Won&apos;t make you jump, but will make you wiggle your toes in your snuggie.

The ending was kind of rushed. I would have liked to know more about the dead room and what transpired all those years ago to put the spooks in that situation.

Død snø,"A ski vacation turns horrific for a group of medical students, as they find themselves confronted by an unimaginable menace: Nazi zombies.","Norwegian Zombie terror film about some Nazis dead coming back to life on snowy lands . A ski vacation turns horrific for a group of medical students, as they find themselves confronted by an unimaginable menace: Nazi zombies. This low-budget terror motion picture deals with a group who run into a pack Nazis coming back to life and terrorizing an unnamed Norwegian area .This clever horror movie deals about an ever-dwindling group of hikers. They drink and party until a mysterious scout arrives. He tells them the dark history of the region; during WWII, a force of Einsatzgruppen led by the dreaded Standartenführer Herzog occupied the location . During three long years the Nazis abused and tortured the local people, and near the end of the war, with Germany&apos;s defeat looming, looted all their valuables before beginning to withdraw from the place . The villagers managed to stage an uprising and ambushed the Nazis, killing many. The surviving Nazis, including Herzog, were pursued into the valleys , and it was assumed that they all froze to death . Later on , the hikers are afflicted by stalking, vicious flesh-eating stiffs relieved .

Gory, gruesome , pretty repellent , and ghastly cannibal feast in which the stumbling flesh-eating stiffs are reanimated and can be only destroyed by bullets in the brain , slashing and throat-hacking . Unrelenting shock-feast laced with brief touches of black humor and tongue-in-cheek . Army of Zombies appearance roaming the countryside , booth and some people besieged inside a cottage deliver the goods , enough to be interesting .Main great success from Norway cinema is compelling directed with startling visual content and nice production by Tommy Wirkola ; furthermore special mention to excellent make-up by the magnificent Norwegian craftsmen . This frightening movie is plenty of thrills, chills, body-count executed by the eerie Nazi Zombies and photographed in pallid color with lurid images and phenomenal results . This is a classic excruciatingly Zombie film where the intrigue,tension, suspense appears threatening and lurking on the snowy outdoors , shack , mountains and many other places . In Norway considered the plus ultra of thoroughly disturbing movie is less stomach-churning by nowadays&apos;s standards . Død snø (original title) is a genuinely frightening story with correct utilization of images-shock and well photographed on location in Alta, Finnmark, Norway and Målselv, Troms. It contains a creepy and eerie musical score and appropriate cinematography . The director creates a special Zombie thriller that manages to be both scary and skilfully made, deserving its cult status . Rating: Good, this is one more imaginative horror pictures in which the camera stalks in sinister style and packing lots of blood and gore , but also some laughs . It&apos;s just one long unrelenting cannibal feast and average budget horror movie that still packs a punch for those who like to be terrorized out their wits. Other films dealing with Zombies Nazis are the following : ¨Shock Waves (1977)¨ by Ken Wiederhorn with Peter Cushing and Brooke Adams ; ¨Grave of the living dead (1983)¨ by Jesus Franco and ¨Horror of war (2006)¨ by John Whitney.",6,"['Comedy', 'Fantasy', 'Horror']","['zombie', 'nazi zombie', 'nazi', 'snowmobile', 'snow']",2009-01-09,['Tommy Wirkola'],"['Jeppe Beck Laursen', 'Charlotte Frogner', 'Jenny Skavlan']","['Tommy Wirkola', 'Stig Frode Henriksen']"
Død snø 2,"Still on the run from a group of Nazi zombies, a man seeks the aid of a group of American zombie enthusiasts, and discovers new techniques for fighting the zombies.","&apos;DEAD SNOW 2: RED VS. DEAD&apos;: Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Sequel to the 2009 Norwegian zombie horror-comedy flick; about a group of students attacked by Nazi zombies, in the Norwegian mountains. The sole survivor, of that film, is now trying to defend a Norwegian town; from annihilation, by the Nazi zombies. It was once again directed by Tommy Wirkola and written by Wirkola, Stig Frode Henriksen and Vegar Hoel. Hoel and Henriksen also once again star in the movie and this time they&apos;re joined by Martin Starr, Ingrid Haas, Jocelyn DeBoer, Hallvard Holmen, Kristoffer Joner, Amrita Acharia, Derek Mears and Orjan Garnst (reprising his role as Colonel Herzog). I loved the movie; it&apos;s so much fun! Picking up right where the first film left off; Martin (Hoel) is still on the run from the Nazi zombies, and he crashes his car in the mountains. He ends up in a hospital where a doctor replaces his amputated arm, that he sawed off in the first film (to stop a zombie infection), with the undead arm of Colonel Herzog (Garnst). He can&apos;t control the arm, at first, and it murders several people. He later learns that he has special zombie powers, thanks to his new zombie arm. He also learns that Herzog, and his army of undead Nazis, plan on destroying a town; as part of a 70-year-old assignment, given to them by Hitler. Martin finds help from a WWII museum employee, named Glenn (Henriksen), and three American siblings; calling themselves the &apos;Zombie Squad&apos;. They&apos;re lead by a nerd named Daniel (Starr). The movie is full of excessive and extremely grotesque zombie violence; it&apos;s definitely not a film for everyone, but it&apos;s also full of really funny light-hearted humor. The action scenes are so much fun and the characters are all likable and mostly relatable (in an exaggerated way). The additions of Star and Holmen, to the cast, are brilliant and there&apos;s a classic zombie sidekick character (Joner) as well. Hoel is also, once again, outstanding in the lead and Wirkola&apos;s directing is perfect. It&apos;s sure to become a cult classic, like the original, and its also highly reminiscent of &apos;EVIL DEAD II&apos;; which is a good thing (in my opinion).",9,"['Action', 'Comedy', 'Fantasy']","['zombie', 'soviet zombie', 'nazi zombie', 'zombie horror', 'sequel']",2014-10-07,['Tommy Wirkola'],"['Geir Vegar Hoel', 'Ørjan Gamst', 'Martin Starr']","['Tommy Wirkola', 'Geir Vegar Hoel', 'Stig Frode Henriksen']"

Death Bed: The Bed That Eats,A bed possessed by a demon spirit consumes its users alive.,"Death Bed: The Bed That Eats is without a doubt one of the weirdest horror films I have ever seen. It&apos;s not just the plot that astounds with its sheer surrealistic nuttiness, but also the execution: the avant-garde direction, the strange music, the kooky performances, the random editing, and the echoey voice-over from the spirit of an artist trapped behind a painting, all of which go to make this a real one-of-a-kind off-the-wall movie.

Told in four chapters - Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, and Just Desserts - the film revolves around a bed that devours anyone and anything that comes in contact with it. The bed - created by a tree demon in the form of a breeze - came to life when the woman the demon wished to seduce suddenly died. Over the years the bed, which occupies an abandoned house, has claimed many victims, dissolving their bodies in the acid that sloshes around under its sheets. One of these victims was the aforementioned artist, who, imprisoned behind his own work of art for 70 years, bears witness to each and every death.

When three young women arrive at the house, the bed begins to feed again, starting with cutie Suzan (Julie Ritter, who gets nekkid before being eaten), followed by Diane (Demene Hall), who might have escaped if it hadn&apos;t been for those pesky prehensile bed sheets. The third girl, Sharon (Rosa Luxemburg), is spared, because her eyes remind the bed of the demon&apos;s dead maiden.

Crazy moments include the bed consuming an apple and regurgitating the core, Suzan dreaming of eating bugs, the bed devouring an orgy, and an eyeball rolling around the sheets, but for my money the most memorable scene is when Sharon&apos;s brother stupidly tries to stab the bed and finds himself wrist deep in acid, the bed dissolving the flesh, leaving him with skeletal hands that start to break apart as the cartilage wastes away.

With bonkers stuff like that, I happily recommend the film to fans of bizarre cinema, even if, truth be told, it isn&apos;t really all that good.",5,['Horror'],"['demon', 'bed', 'animate object', 'female nudity', 'supernatural power']",,['George Barry'],"['Demene Hall', 'William Russ', 'Julie Ritter']",['George Barry']

Death Ship,A mysterious ghostly freighter rams and sinks a modern day cruise ship whose survivors climb aboard the freighter and discover that it is a World War II Nazi torture vessel.,"When I was a little kid, driving by this local videostore on my bike, I always stopped to take a quick peek at this amazingly cool video-cover displayed in front of the store window (just look up the poster art here on IMDb). Around that same time I saw on television just a few little fragments of a French-dubbed horror movie taking place on a ship. The name George Kennedy both on the cover and on the credits linked the two facts together. By the time I was old enough to go rent it, the copy had mysteriously disappeared from the videostore. I&apos;ve been on the look-out for this film ever since.

Thanx to Dario_the_2nd (fellow horror-boarder) the wait finally came to an end. And to say it right away: I honestly don&apos;t understand the low rating this film has here on IMDb. Sure it&apos;s not a perfect movie; the story is pretty thin and the acting isn&apos;t really memorable or something (though not bad at all either). What this movie lacks in the plot-department, at makes up more than enough in eerie atmosphere and creepiness. When a luxury cruise ship sinks, a few survivors adrift find their way onto a huge, dirty and abandoned ship, apparently floating dead in the water. But not quite as dead as they expected, they&apos;ll soon find out. The pace of the movie is rather slow, but the ship itself is frightening and menacing. With numerous shots of its self-functioning engine, countless pipes, valves and other iron-work, the vessel establishes itself as a threatening presence, or even more so: a real character, throughout the entire movie. It&apos;s no secret at all that this ship is haunted and the reason why is quite shocking. Two scenes that stayed with me from when I was a kid, were that-one-lady-in-the-projection-room-turning-ugly and especially the blood-shower scene. The latter one really is a foul scene. Of course, you&apos;ve seen that before, but this is one of the better efforts. However, this still remains a very un-stylized B-movie. No fancy cinematography, no well-balanced lighting and a lot of hand-held camera shots. But all this adds to the effect of realism. And at not one point I found myself giggling at the sort of clumsiness of the mise-en-scène (which I actually expected to do so, before going into this movie). As much as the editing is rudimentary, their are some fine textbook examples of cross-cutting to be found. A technique seldomly used anymore. At least not in mainstream films. The rather minimalistic but effective musical score helped to set the right tone from the opening credits on.

I could conclude that this flick might perhaps not be enjoyed by the general horror-fan nowadays, but if you&apos;re interested in the weird and bizarre, then this one is worth hunting down.

La mort en direct,"In a future where dying of illness is exceedingly rare, a terminally ill woman becomes a celebrity and a man with camera implants goes to secretly record her for a morbid TV show.","Bertrand Tavernier&apos;s tale of a critically ill woman hounded by a television network for its popular show &apos;Deathwatch&apos; could be looked back in 1980 as almost a premonition in these times of reality TV and their popularity with today&apos;s viewing public.

A strong cast portrays a simple, if at times ponderous story dealing the acceptance of death and those out to prosper from it, with Harvey Keitel putting in a passionate driving performance as the TV company&apos;s &apos;virtual camera&apos;, a point in the film which adds a certain element of fantasy to the whole proceedings, along with vague decrepit industrial towns and eerie bays as the backdrop for the main characters to drift through. However, despite strong performances all round, the journey the film takes never seems to reach a definitive destination, rather slows, bogs down and then finally stops, and despite keeping the viewer intrigued throughout never seems to deliver anything more than the inevitable.

There is no doubt &apos;Deathwatch&apos; is an original, eerie and at times beautiful film but one that does not necessarily make sense, just like Max von Sydow&apos;s eloquent line in the film that &apos;Events that have no significance like the flight of a bird, do not have to mean something.&apos;",,"['Drama', 'Sci-Fi', 'Thriller']","['reality tv production', 'remarriage', 'fictional reality show', 'near future', '1980s']",,['Bertrand Tavernier'],"['Romy Schneider', 'Harvey Keitel', 'Harry Dean Stanton']","['David Compton', 'David Rayfiel', 'Bertrand Tavernier']"

The Deep End of the Ocean,"A film about a family&apos;s reaction when Ben, the youngest son, is kidnapped and then found nine years later, living in the same town, where his family had just moved.","Beth Cappadora (Michelle Pfeiffer) is at her high school reunion when her 3-year-old son disappears from his brother&apos;s care. The little boy never turns up, and the family has to deal with the devastating guilt and grief that goes along with it. Nine years later, the family has relocated to Chicago. By a sheer fluke, the kid turns up, living no more than two blocks away. The authorities swoop down and return the kid to his biological parents, but things are far from being that simple. The boy grew up around what he has called his father, while his new family are strangers to him; the older son, now a teenager, has brushes with the law and behavioral problems. His adjustment to his lost brother is complicated by normal teenage churlishness, and the dad (Treat Williams) seems to expect everything to fall into place as though the family had been intact all along. It&apos;s a tightrope routine for actors in a story like this, being careful not to chew the scenery while at the same time not being too flaccid or understated. For the most part, the members of the cast deal well with the emotional complexity of their roles. Though the story stretches credulity, weirder things do happen in the real world. The family&apos;s pain for the first half of the film is certainly credible, though the second half almost seems like a different movie. Whoopi Goldberg plays the detective assigned to the case; casting her is a bit of a stretch, but she makes it work.

It was much more realistic than Armageddon(which I think is one of the most overrated &apos;blockbusters&apos; ever)There are no comic relief characters, no cheesy one-liners and no gorgeous movie stars(no offense to Tea Leoni). The solution to the problem was more real in Deep Impact and the time frame was much more believable. I like how the film focused more on what was happening on earth rather than in the spaceship. The end was interesting because the disaster wasn&apos;t totally averted so there was no cheerful hugging in the end with lame Aerosmith playing over it. The only thing that bothered me was that all of the nuclear missiles from the US and Russia had no effect on the comet. Wouldn&apos;t several hundred nukes do something? anything? and why wasn&apos;t the Messiah destroyed in the blast?

Deliver Us from Evil,"New York police officer Ralph Sarchie investigates a series of crimes.

I&apos;ve seen this film twice now and boy I enjoyed it very, very much. I&apos;ve always liked movies involving evil and demonology since the plot, effects, action and suspense are always entertaining to watch

The story is like a combination of Se7en and Exorcist where cop is on a case to solve murder cases supernatural style. In a way, it was something a bit new to my eyes and I was glued to my seat within every minute of the film. The suspense, horror and jump scares were definitely there and that really made the film work. There is also a side story on the main character in the film which explains why he is the way he is and at times made me feel sorry for him

The effects within the film like the ritual ceremony scenes, blood etc in a way were pretty gory and intense to watch and will really make you feel a bit nauseate throughout the film but they were really well made

Eric Bana does a solid job as Ralph Sarchie. It&apos;s been a while since I&apos;ve seen him on the big screen (last was in the Star Trek 2009 film). He puts on a very excellent performance in this film and I was and I really felt the pain that he brought to the character throughout the film. You can really tell that he&apos;s having a really hard time with his guilt, family crisis and suffering he goes through everyday as a cop in this movie. Edgar Ramirez plays Mendoza, a priest detective being sent to solve this mystery case. He also puts on a very convincing performance and shows that he&apos;s not the typical kind of priest that we hear and see everyday. He has his own demons of the past to deal with and it shows here in this film. Joel McHale as Butler, Sarchie&apos;s partner in the film plays a streetwise kind of cop and I really loved his knife fighting skills in the film. Verywell choreographed. Other than those 3 characters, the rest didn&apos;t have anything much to with the story a apart from playing as the victims and back up characters for this movie which in my opinion played out really well

Its personally my movie of the month and way better than Transformers 4. I would definitely get did movie once it&apos;s available for download. Overall, I really enjoyed this film and would place in my top 10 films of the year. However, I can&apos;t believe that this film is not making that much money that it deserves and how bad the critics are bashing it. I say for all you action horror fans out there, go and give this movie a try and judge it for yourselves. I don&apos;t think you&apos;ll be all that disappointed.

The plot follows a dream logic known only to the director with too much time spent watching these sailors fight, rape or just sit in a bar.

The Departed,An undercover cop and a mole in the police attempt to identify each other while infiltrating an Irish gang in South Boston.,"Definitely the the type of movie that makes it worth going to the theater. Very intense action and violence, twisting plot, lot&apos;s of misdirection.

The story line is a bit overly whelming at times, this isn&apos;t a good movie to watch if you&apos;re tired and follow the action, the double crosses and the sometimes confusing who&apos;s who of the movie, but if you can just remember the basic characters the minor twists won&apos;t be too confusing.

While it&apos;s certainly not a love story, there is that element, with a bit of a morality play going the whole time.

I can&apos;t make some of the statements I&apos;d like to make because I really try to avoid spoilers in my reviews, but I&apos;ll say that I enjoyed the movie even though had I been in charge it may have ended differently...

All that said, if you like a thriller that has some rough and tough violence and a plot with a few twists and turns this film would be one I&apos;d recommend to you.",8,"['Crime', 'Drama', 'Thriller']","['police', 'mobster', 'irish mafia', 'organized crime', 'scene of the crime']",2006-10-06,['Martin Scorsese'],"['Leonardo DiCaprio', 'Matt Damon', 'Jack Nicholson']","['William Monahan', 'Alan Mak', 'Felix Chong']"

Devil,A group of people are trapped in an elevator and the Devil is mysteriously amongst them.,"Maybe 7 out of 10 is generous but I mark it highly perhaps because I had such low expectations which were thankfully unnecessary.

This film&apos;s credits open with the title The Night Chronicles 1 which suggests to me his fan-boy homage to Spielberg has stretched to emulating the guru&apos;s Amazing Stories phase. This film does feel rather like one of those episodes rather than a full-blown movie: no stars, little location etc.

However, as a story, it&apos;s rather good (suspension of disbelief taken for granted).

And, it&apos;s rather well handled directorially. For instance, the upside-down sklyline speaks volumes without costing any extra.

The film is ultimately a whodunnit. Maybe I&apos;m stupid but come betting slip time, I didn&apos;t get it. If you do, you may hate it. I didn&apos;t so I don&apos;t.

The Devil Commands,Scientist becomes obsessed with the idea of communicating with his dead wife.,"Kindly Dr. Revere (Boris Karloff) has found a way to record the brain waves of people. His loving wife is tragically killed in a car accident. Revere however gets a reading from his dead wife (he thinks) when alone in is lab. He becomes obsessed with trying to communicate with her beyond the grave. He ends up with a cruel conniving fake medium (Anne Revere) and some corpses borrowed from the nearby cemetery.

OK--the plot doesn&apos;t make a lick of sense. He does turn on the machine after his wife dies and he DOES get a message--but how can he know it&apos;s her? Why does he need to use other dead bodies to communicate with his wife? Why not dig up HER body and try it? Too many questions. The sets are threadbare (looks more like a PRC production than Columbia), talented character actress Revere gives out her worse performance, the silly narration doesn&apos;t work and it just completely derails at the end. Still Karloff is good (as always) and gives this junk a better performance than it deserves. He single handedly makes this an OK movie. It just isn&apos;t that scary. It does have a somewhat spooky scene where a maid is stuck in a room with a bunch of dead bodies but that&apos;s it.

Devil Dog: The Hound of Hell,A dog that is a minion of Satan terrorizes a suburban family.,"I remember Devil Dog playing on TBS almost 20 years ago, and my older sister and her friends watching it and laughing all the next day. It&apos;s not that bad for a made-for-TV horror movie, but it is derivative (mostly of The Exorcist) and businesslike, for lack of a better word. It won&apos;t blow you away with artful cinematography or great acting, but it&apos;s not a waste of time, either. It&apos;s the kind of movie you watch to kill a couple of hours when you aren&apos;t in the mood to think too hard.

However, if you go into the movie looking for some laughs, you won&apos;t be disappointed. The early scenes, with Lucky the Devil Dog as a cute little puppy with Children of the Damned eyes are hilariously non-threatening, and the climactic blue-screen effects of a giant black dog (with horns!) are pretty side-splitting. And keep an eye out for the cloaked Satanist in Maverick shades toward the beginning.

Enlivened by a dramatic percussive score by Edwin Astley and a cast of familiar faces (too bad Nyah was seeking men, since Hazel Court & Adrienne Corri are by far the most impressive specimens).

The Devil&apos;s Rejects,"The murderous, backwoods Firefly family take to the road to escape the vengeful Sheriff Wydell, who is not afraid of being as ruthless as his target.","This movie has some classic ingredients for a great horror movie.

Daily and Michael Berryman (The Hills Have Eyes) provide more than enough nostalgia for retro junkies, like myself.

The story isn&apos;t overly fast paced but the gore can be thick and pretty relentless and is at times implied rather than shown which I think adds to the experience. I really enjoyed Leslie Easterbrook as Mother Firefly (replacing Karen Black who was in the first movie, House Of 1000 Corpses). She does some wonderful overacting in her scenes, it&apos;s a shame she wasn&apos;t in it more, same goes for E.G. Daily who plays a sassy hooker. In fact everyone was great in their parts, let&apos;s face it this is not Shakespeare - this is a horror movie, I for one demand hammy over the top performances and a bit of camp! I don&apos;t want to give anything away but I will say my favourite scenes involved Mother Firefly and the sheriff, and Captain Spaulding and a mother and child. If you enjoyed House Of 1000 Corpses, this is a superior sequel in my mind and you wont be disappointed.

James Bond is sent to North Korea to kill a renegade colonel selling weapons for diamonds. He is double crossed by someone and is captured.

The North Korean start has some decent action, but it&apos;s the fact that he&apos;s captured that makes it great. When he had to go to the Chinese for help, I thought this could get interesting. The high point of the movie has to be Halle Berry coming onshore with that bikini. From there, the movie slowly grinds down with one silliness after another.

The worst has to be the villain played be Toby Stephens. His character is unimaginative and can be best describe as a twit or a douche. I was hoping for threatening. Then there&apos;s the ice hotel.

Die Hard,A New York City police officer tries to save his estranged wife and several others taken hostage by terrorists during a Christmas party at the Nakatomi Plaza in Los Angeles.,"Die Hard (1988) 

*** (out of 4)

Enjoyable and tense thriller about a group of terrorists (led by Alan Rickman) who overtake a L.A. skyscraper and the only thing keeping them from getting away with their crime is a New York police officer (Bruce Willis) there on vacation. There&apos;s a lot of very good things about this movie but I&apos;ve always thought that the majority of the credit has to go to star Willis. He might not have been a A-list star at the time this was released but it&apos;s easy to see why he became one afterwards. I think what&apos;s so great about him and the character he plays is that we can believe he&apos;s just your typical guy you&apos;d see walking around on the streets with you. That every-day-man quality that Willis has works so well here because of the odds stacked against his character you can&apos;t help but just sit back and enjoy this one person taking out a professional organization. The hilarious one-liners, the smart remarks and the way Willis makes himself know to the terrorists is just classic and we get so many great showdowns that you can&apos;t help enjoy all of them. It certainly doesn&apos;t hurt that you&apos;ve got a strong supporting cast with Rickman being a villain you just love to hate. The coldness RIckman brings to the part is the perfect contrast to Willis&apos; cop and it works perfectly. Reginald VelJohnson, William Atherton, Bonnie Bedelia and Paul Gleason also add great support for Willis to play off of. The action scenes are certainly some of the best you&apos;re going to see and what holds them together so well is the direction by John McTiernan. He perfectly blends the humor, tension and the action but he also gives the film a wonderful pace that keeps it moving at a fast rate.

But once the nurse begins work things change.

This psychological thriller has the definite feel of a TV movie. I can find no definitive evidence that it is but I would not be surprised in the least to discover it is one. It seems to have been promoted as a horror movie. The title is quite in-your-face and the poster art is somewhat misleading. It shows a nubile scantily dressed young woman running away from an ominous house while being terrorised by several brutish hands that reach out to grab her from crumbling walls. It combines imagery of Gothic horror with Roman Polanski&apos;s Repulsion. It&apos;s a great poster! But, it&apos;s hardly accurate in terms of describing the actual content. First and foremost, this is not a horror film. It&apos;s pretty solidly a thriller. It&apos;s about family secrets and greed within a Gothic setting. It has occasional spooky moments such as nightmarish dream sequences and secrets in the basement.

Despite some of the negativity directed at it, I found Die Sister, Die! to be perfectly enjoyable. It&apos;s well acted, including a turn from Kent Smith who starred in the classic Cat People (1942).

The reason I love the movie is this : the characters. I&apos;ve read other users comments regarding the lack of writing or character motivation, and there is validity to that. But hey, the selling point of the film wasn&apos;t an in-depth look at people, the selling point was watching Peter Fonda and Susan George ram their car into several other cars.

But I digress, what I love about the characters (and what I hate about the characters in most action movies today) is that they are totally unlikeable. They even hate each other. Fonda is a complete jerk to everyone. Susan George rhymes with rich and Rorke is weak and ineffectual. Hey, most the time the characters don&apos;t like each other. And it&apos;s my opinion that these characters are unlikeable by design. Think about it: when was the last time you went to the movies and the main characters were people you were suppose to dislike? Rare is it that modern filmmakers will take that chance, Even more impressive, somehow you end up routing for these people.

The Dirty Mind of Young Sally,"The voluptuous, sultry, foxy owner of a pirate radio station manages to always stay one step ahead of the police who constantly try to put her hot roadshow out of business for good.","One of a kind, irresistible soft core (not that soft either) staring Sharon Kelly, from time when young girls had naturally large firm breasts. Sharon is a travelling radio artiste who, despite being chased all over by the cops, manages to broadcast three shows a day. These consist of her talking dirty whilst playing with herself, or her engineer, or even a competition winner. Young teens then gather around to listen in and perform along with her, on the beach, at their club or in the back of their car. Essentially therefore the &apos;plot&apos; allows for multiple activity and minimal dialogue. Just as well because although Sharon is excellent, those around her range from average to unbelievably poor. It matters not, however, because it&apos;s her , her activities and those she inspires that&apos;s the thing. The individual acts are all slightly overlong but they are so well done that it&apos;s a little churlish to complain. Everybody seems to be enjoying themselves, everything looks good, the music is bearable and that evocative mix of furtive fumbling and Woodstock style freedom will always seem good to those of a certain age!",7,['Comedy'],"['hot', 'sex scene', 'sex on the first date', 'sex on a beach', 'voyeur']",1973-09-14,['Bethel Buckalew'],"['Colleen Brennan', 'George &apos;Buck&apos; Flower', 'Norman Fields']",['Bethel Buckalew']
The Dish,"A remote Australian community, populated by quirky characters, plays a key role in the first Apollo moon landing.","This film was extremely hard for me to get into, but once I got interested, I couldn&apos;t turn away. The performances were great the story was pleasantly refreshing. After I had seen the small town Irish comedy WAKING NED DEVINE, I was in the mood for feel-good comedies. THE DISH was the next best thing. But, as it turns out, I liked THE DISH far better.

It is a small town comedy set in a rural Australian town during the days preceeding the Apollo 11 landing on the moon. When Neil Armstrong walked on the moon, it brought everyone on the Earth together. This film gives an idea as to what it must have been like to see that experience.

The film was a greatly pleasant movie and I was totally delighted to have a film as heartwarming and truly great as this. Sam Neill (JURASSIC PARK) and Patrick Warburton (SCREAM 3, BIG TROUBLE) who I feel are both very good actors take the leading roles of this delightful movie experience. Surely a film that you will want to watch over and over again. I recommend OCTOBER SKY and WAKING NED DEVINE.

Django Unchained,"With the help of a German bounty-hunter, a freed slave sets out to rescue his wife from a brutal plantation owner in Mississippi.","I only had one thought on my mind for this Christmas: see Django Unchained. Quentin Tarantino&apos;s latest opus, a Western set two years before the Civil War, concerns a former slave named Django (Jamie Foxx). He is freed by bounty hunter Dr. King Shultz (Christoph Waltz) in order to help him with a bounty. Quite quickly, Shultz takes Django under his wing and trains him as his partner. But he made him a promise: that he would rescue his wife from a plantation owned by the ruthless Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). And rescuing her is not going to be all that easy.

What pains me the most about Django Unchained, as a die-hard Tarantino fan, is just how sloppy it all seems. I enjoyed every minute of it, but I could never shake the feeling of how messy and thrown together it all feels. Portions of the film feel episodic (the search for the Brittle Brothers, mentioned heavily in the trailers, begins and ends practically within minutes), and some scenes just seem to play out just for the fun of it. Another scene from the trailers involving a lynch mob with bags covering their faces seems added for comedic purposes, and has no real point of actually existing. More than any of his films before it, Django feels like Tarantino simply making a movie for sheer pleasure and with no outside motivations or controllers. 

The film threatens to go totally off the rails at any given moment, and lacks any real sense of direction or focus. It may sound ridiculous, but the loss of editor Sally Menke confirms a sneaking suspicion I always had about Tarantino – he needed a steady right hand to help encourage him as to what was needed and what was not. I do not want to criticize Django&apos;s editor Fred Raskin, but it is obvious he is no Menke and that works against the film heavily. It lacks the polish we have come to expect, and is practically stripped of the glossy/cool texture so prevalent in Tarantino&apos;s work up until now.

But then maybe that was his intention all along, and perhaps Tarantino is airing out his frustrations with life and film in general. Django is deliberately shot on film (or at least from the print I saw), and looks very gritty and messy at all times. It is significantly more brutally violent than anything he has worked on before (the borderline cartoonish Kill Bill included), and has a very go for broke attitude about itself. The film seems to revel in how brilliantly it can splatter all the blood and gore (done through the use of squibs and no digital!), and how uncomfortably numbing it can make the violence. I know he does not care what people think of his films, but this movie especially seems like an emphatically raised middle finger to the establishment. And for all of my complaints about how messy it all feels, I was never once bored or felt like the movie was dragging itself out. The staggering 165-minute running time shockingly flies by faster than you might ever imagine.

Acting wise, Tarantino stacks the deck with a number of recognizable character actors young and old for roles that vary in size. Most have very few lines, if any at all, and seem to just stand by, just as content as the audience is to watch the action unfold. It is a little off-putting, especially with how important some of these characters are initially made out to be. Washington as Broomhilda von Shaft (one of the most subtle references he&apos;s ever dropped) does well as the helpless victim and frequent dreamlike object – but she never really gets to show off any of her acting prowess outside of her facial reactions. They are increasingly effective, especially during horrific flashback scenes. But her work here feels ridiculously stunted in comparison to the other leads. Samuel L. Jackson, much like Tarantino himself, seems to just be having fun in his role as Candie&apos;s adviser Stephen. He plays on every ridiculous stereotype he ever has been associated with and then amps it up to a near ludicrous state. He is frequently hilarious, but the role seems to border on parody more than anything else.

Surprisingly, Foxx takes a very long time settling into the leading role. It may just be the character, but it is quite clear from the on- set that he is not very comfortable in Django&apos;s shoes, and leads credence to why Will Smith, amongst so many others, dropped out of the picture so quickly. But once he finds his footing, he does a fantastic job walking the thin line between empathetic and sadistic. It is not an easy character to play, but Foxx makes it his own, bringing a sense of style and grace that are virtually absent from the rest of the film. And of course, he gets all the best lines.

Waltz and DiCaprio are the clear standouts however, nailing every nuance of their sadly underwritten characters. While Waltz plays the straight man, DiCaprio is delightfully unhinged and vicious. Both are playing directly against type, yet are strangely comfortable in the roles. Watching them act circles around the rest of the cast, Foxx included, is the true highlight of the film. I just wish they were both given additional emphasis and more to do. 

For all of its numerous faults, I had a blast watching Django Unchained. It is hilarious, it is a lot of fun, and is wildly enjoyable. I genuinely think it could have been a lot better if there was more focus and direction, but this is very clearly a picture Tarantino wanted to make on his own terms. And for that, I applaud him for the effort. It is not his best work, but certainly not his worst.

Do the Right Thing,"On the hottest day of the year on a street in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, everyone&apos;s hate and bigotry smolders and builds until it explodes into violence.","As a non white or non black person my self I view this film from a different perspective as I can&apos;t relate to either community. I understand Lee&apos;s message and point in the film and even after 30 years after the release, it is more relevant than ever. But for the character of Sal, he is punished for standing his ground. Should he have racially abused black people based on their race, no. But should he have been given the blame for the death of a black man, no. If Raheem killed Sal, which is definitely what he was trying by strangling him, the black community in the film wouldn&apos;t have been guilty for his death and say he deserved it. All he did was brake his radio. Sal saying that he only puts Italian American people on his wall is completely justified as he comes from a Italian heritage. If a white man entered the restaurant of a black man and said put up pictures of white men that wouldn&apos;t be seen as right. And it applies for both races, just because he is a white man doesn&apos;t mean he should be punished. Mookie&apos;s decision to boycott the restaurant and allow for the rest to burn down Sal&apos;s restaurant has no justification. I didn&apos;t understand Lee&apos;s point, was he trying to make black people look worse of better? To me it only represented what Americans think of the black community.",7,"['Comedy', 'Drama']","['pizzeria', 'bedford stuyvesant brooklyn new york city', 'police', 'pizza', 'boycott']",1989-07-21,['Spike Lee'],"['Danny Aiello', 'Ossie Davis', 'Ruby Dee']",['Spike Lee']

Dr. Giggles,"A madman who believes he&apos;s a doctor comes to the town where his crazy father was killed, and soon begins murdering people and becoming infatuated with a teenage girl who has a heart condition.","Dr. Giggles (1992) 

** (out of 4) 

The psychopath Dr. Giggles (Larry Drake) escapes from a mental hospital and heads towards his hometown where years earlier the town people killed his father. Giggles plans on seeking revenge by killing as many as he can but he has a special place for a young girl suffering from a bad heart condition. I remember seeing this thing at the theater when I was 12-years-old and I remember liking it a lot. With that said, seeing it again all these years later had me scratching my head as to what it was I actually liked. There&apos;s a lot wrong with this picture but then again there wasn&apos;t much the genre was offering people in 1992. After the genre died out in the late 80s and until SCREAM would come along, horror fans really didn&apos;t have that much to go to so perhaps that&apos;s why I got a kick out of seeing this back then. Either way, that really doesn&apos;t matter because looking at this film today shows how many warts it actually has. The biggest problem I had is that there&apos;s really nothing special, exciting or entertaining that ever happens. We&apos;ve got the usual maniac breaking out of the nut house and killing various dumb teenagers who put themselves in a bad situation. The screenplay really doesn&apos;t offer us anything new except that our killer giggles all the time. I&apos;m not sure if that should be considered ground breaking but it&apos;s a minor twist that really doesn&apos;t add anything. We also have Giggles taking a few points from Freddy as he also goes for the various one-liners but most of them are pretty stupid but at the same time some of them are the type of jokes you&apos;d expect to hear from an unfunny doctor. There are a few good things with one being Drake who really does do a nice job in the role. He handles the bad lines with a straight face and he really seems to be having fun. The supporting players fit their roles just fine even if none of them are overly good. The MPAA obviously got a hold of this thing as it appears most death scenes have been trimmed but we still have a couple goods ones left including one where a woman gets her stomach pretty much sucked out. DR. GIGGLES is an average slasher that&apos;s certainly not the best but clearly far from the worst.",,"['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Horror']","['condom', 'overhearing sex', 'syringe', 'ferris wheel', 'beer']",1992-10-23,['Manny Coto'],"['Larry Drake', 'Holly Marie Combs', 'Cliff De Young']","['Manny Coto', 'Graeme Whifler']"
Dr. No,A resourceful British government agent seeks answers in a case involving the disappearance of a colleague and the disruption of the American space program.,"I first saw this in the late 80s on a vhs. Revisited it recently. It is the first film in the Bond series where Bond is sent to Jamaica to investigate the disappearance of a fellow British agent. The trail leads him to Dr. No, a former member of a Chinese crime syndicate but currently working for SPECTRE. Here Bond faces dragon-disguised swamp buggy, venomous tarantula spider, &apos;three blind mice&apos; n a villain with metal hands. Fortunately Bond has three amazing ladies to cool off, Eunice Gayson, Zena Marshall n Ursula Andress.

Some interesting facts from the novel which is missing in the movie. The Chinese gangsters tortured Dr No, cut off his hands n shot him through the left side of the chest and left him for dead. Dr No survived due to a condition called dextrocardia in which his heart is on the right side of the body. He later joined SPECTRE n got his metal hands.",8,"['Action', 'Adventure', 'Thriller']","['british secret service', 'official bond film', 'official james bond series', '007', 'jamaica']",1962-10-10,['Terence Young'],"['Sean Connery', 'Ursula Andress', 'Bernard Lee']","['Richard Maibaum', 'Johanna Harwood', 'Berkely Mather']"

And then I finally got to see &apos;Dr.Strangelove&apos;. Wow. What a terrific, pitch black satire. This film is so wild and mean and funny - and Peter Sellers gives THE performance of his career. Unlike in any of Kubrick&apos;s later works, there&apos;s a sense of playfulness here that gives the whole movie a crazy kind of energy; I&apos;m guessing that Seller&apos;s love for improvisation forced Kubrick to ditch his usual perfectionism to a certain degree (and the film is all the better for it). Sharp, outrageously entertaining comedy/satire by one of the most revered directors of the past century. 10 out of 10.

Doghouse,"A group of men, heading to a remote village to help one of their friends get over his divorce, soon discover that all the women have been infected with a virus that makes them man-hating cannibals.","After travelling to a remote village for a weekend of drunken debauchery and male bonding, a group of friends come under attack from the women of the village, who have turned into bloodthirsty cannibals as the result of a top-secret biological warfare experiment carried out by the army.

Those looking for a stylish slice of quirky Brit comedy/horror in the vein of Shaun of the Dead, be warned: Jake West&apos;s Doghouse is aimed squarely at the lad-mag reading, post-footy, post-pub, post-curry crowd, and as such, the level of sophistication is not exactly high. Don&apos;t expect clever word-play, irony, post-modernism, surrealism, or satire; do expect tit jokes, loads of swearing, mindless violence, and puerile gags about shagging zombies, all of which could have been tons of fun, if only the film&apos;s characters hadn&apos;t been such an unlikable bunch of &apos;blokes&apos; (fully deserving of everything they get), and director Jake West hadn&apos;t forgotten to develop his plot beyond a repetitive string of silly chase scenes and gory battles.

Although Doghouse is far from the worst British film in recent years to attempt combining laughs with scares (that honour goes to the abysmal Lesbian Vampire Killers, closely followed by The Cottage), I really was expecting a lot more from the director of zany splatterfest Evil Aliens, which I thoroughly enjoyed. The basic premise—a blood-drenched battle of the sexes—is an interesting variation on the standard zombie plot, the design and execution of the female creatures is impressive (each has its own distinctive look and personality), and the gore is well executed; but with the comedy being so moronic, the narrative rapidly going nowhere, and not one sympathetic person to root for, Doghouse is definitely something of a disappointment.",5,"['Comedy', 'Horror', 'Sci-Fi']","['ambiguous ending', 'finger chopped off', 'toy gun', 'stop sign', 'old lady zombie']",2009-06-12,['Jake West'],"['Danny Dyer', 'Noel Clarke', 'Emil Marwa']",['Dan Schaffer']

Don&apos;t Breathe,"Hoping to walk away with a massive fortune, a trio of thieves break into the house of a blind man who isn&apos;t as helpless as he seems.","Fede Alvarez just gave Green Room a run for its money with Don&apos;t Breathe, an incredibly intense film and glorious exercise in suspense. It&apos;s one of the best studio-produced thrillers I&apos;ve seen in years. The premise is simple: A group of teens plans to break into a blind man&apos;s house to steal his money. Only thing, the old man is more adept than they realize. While the setup is a little too pedestrian, albeit economical, once the story gets rolling, the film doesn&apos;t let up, running at a lean 88 minutes. Other than that, Don&apos;t Breathe is best viewed going in knowing as little as possible.

This is Alvarez&apos;s first film in three years since his violent and solid remake of Evil Dead, and it is with this sophomoric debut that solidifies the genre filmmaker as someone with obvious talent. Inspirations are drawn from the best - Hitchcock, Fincher, and Wait Until Dark are a few - but Alvarez provides his own unique vision that truly makes the film his own. Like the masters before him, Don&apos;t Breathe is purely cinematic, relying less on dialogue and more on visual storytelling and sound to drive the film. The cinematography is amazing as well as the creative sound design, so much so they are characters within the film themselves.

The cast, while small, is great too, including Jane Levy, who can pretty much be titled this generation&apos;s scream queen after this and Evil Dead. Dylan Minnette is good in his role as well, providing enough sympathy for his character. Both young actors are put through hell, and their physical performances sell their tumultuous ordeal convincingly. However, it is Stephen Lang who is the film&apos;s shining beacon. As the antagonist, Lang is instantly memorable and frightening, an intimidating force that permeates throughout the film even in scenes without his presence.

If there&apos;s one gripe about the film, there&apos;s a plot twist that doesn&apos;t quite work, but that itself is a minor complaint compared to the many things the film gets right and does so well. I won&apos;t say more. Don&apos;t Breathe is a technical achievement, the rare studio film that actually pushes what film can do as a medium. However, like with Green Room, try not to get caught up in the hype, even with my glowing review. Set your expectations appropriately, and remember to avoid watching the trailer.",9,"['Crime', 'Horror', 'Thriller']","['blind man', 'robbery gone awry', 'breaking and entering', 'trapped in a house', 'death of daughter']",2016-08-26,['Fede Alvarez'],"['Stephen Lang', 'Jane Levy', 'Dylan Minnette']","['Fede Alvarez', 'Rodo Sayagues']"

Doomsday,A futuristic action thriller where a team of people work to prevent a disaster threatening the future of the human race.,"This movie was a waste of time for me, and it was such a severe waste of time, that I will spend some more time to warn you against it. If you rent this movie, do not expect to see anything new under the sun. Every character and every group in the movie is completely generic, and seems to be ripped from other movies. The plot is stupid, so very very stupid. The only thing that surprises me in the movie is how little they have done to add to the genre. It is completely forgettable. Every little detail in it was painfully clichéd. And some of them were not thought properly through. For example, in one scene, a screaming head is flying at the camera. No body. Just the head, screaming, completely oblivious to the fact that you would need some sort of air supply through you throat, in order to say anything. I have no choice but to give this movie the lowest score I have ever given a movie in a review, 5/10!",5,"['Action', 'Sci-Fi', 'Thriller']","['quarantine', 'britain', 'the future', 'virus', 'wall']",2008-03-14,['Neil Marshall'],"['Rhona Mitra', 'Bob Hoskins', 'Alexander Siddig']",['Neil Marshall']
The Dorm That Dripped Blood,Four college students are stalked by an unknown assailant while staying on campus over the Christmas holidays to help clear out a dormitory which is to be demolished.,"A handful of college students stay during Christmas break to clean up an old abandoned dorm and find themselves stalked and killed by an unseen killer. Could they be avenging some past transgression? Or are they just some random crazy person?

The Dorm That Dripped Blood isn&apos;t exactly fine art, but it knows what it wants to accomplish and it, more or less, gets the job done (even if it&apos;s done in a workman-like fashion). There&apos;s not a lot of style or extra frills, but some of the special makeup effects are convincing and the film has an admirable mean streak (just wait until you see what happens to poor Daphne Zuniga!)

The finale manages to scrounge up some suspense and it ends on what is, perhaps, the most downbeat note ever played in a slasher film. I&apos;d say most mainstream audiences will be up in the air about this one, but slasher completeists should enjoy it.",7,"['Horror', 'Mystery', 'Thriller']","['psychopathic killer', 'serial killer', 'tragedy', 'video nasty', 'christmas horror']",1982-04-02,"['Stephen Carpenter', 'Jeffrey Obrow']","['Laurie Lapinski', 'Stephen Sachs', 'David Snow']","['Stephen Carpenter', 'Jeffrey Obrow', 'Stacey Giachino']"
Double Exposure,A photographer plagued by horrific nightmares in which he kills the young female models he shoots is shocked to discover that there is a serial killer in his city who is targeting attractive women.,"Double Exposure (1983) 

** 1/2 (out of 4)

Adrian Wilde (Michael Callan) is a photographer who is seeing a shrink because he&apos;s having very bad nightmares about murdering the women he takes photos of. He tries to strike up a relationship with Mindy (Joanna Pettet) but before long he begins to fear that his dreams are real.

DOUBLE EXPOSURE isn&apos;t the most successful film that you&apos;re going to watch but there are enough good moments in it to make it worth watching. The best way to describe the film is saying it&apos;s a cross between the type of thriller that Brian DePalma would make but with the sleaze factor of a slasher. The two go well together and we get some nice performance that help make the film a bit better than it probably deserves to be.

As far as the mystery goes, for the most part we&apos;re given some suspects and we&apos;re made to wait until the very end for the killer to be revealed. I thought the mystery aspect worked quite well, although there are some rather silly moments involving a couple cops working the case. The two of them pretty much just show up every so often whenever the film needs to remind the viewer that the murders are being investigated. What really helps the film is the fact that Callan is so good in the lead role of the troubled man who thinks he might be more damaged that he originally thought. Pettet and James Stacy both add nice support.

The film works as a slasher and especially during the scenes where we see the killer talking various women including prostitutes. There&apos;s a nice sequence where we see a hooker lure the killer down an alleyway. Director William Bryan Hillman makes the film look quite good but a little more energy and a bit more suspense certainly would have helped things. As it stands, DOUBLE EXPOSURE certainly isn&apos;t a masterpiece but it&apos;s a mildly entertaining film.",,"['Crime', 'Drama', 'Horror']","['nightmare', 'photographer', 'model', 'car caravan', 'smoking']",1983-11-09,['William Byron Hillman'],"['Michael Callan', 'Joanna Pettet', 'James Stacy']",['William Byron Hillman']
Dracula,The centuries old vampire Count Dracula comes to England to seduce his barrister Jonathan Harker&apos;s fiancée Mina Murray and inflict havoc in the foreign land.,"I have seen multiple versions of Dracula, but none compare to 1992&apos;s version starring Gary Oldman, the definitive Count Dracula in my opinion. This film is lavish, decadent and wonderfully vivid. It captured the gothic spirit of the novel, it&apos;s deep, romantic, and mixed with tender and violent moments. The visuals to this day are exquisite, the costumes, sets and scenes of Victorian England are superb.

Oldman is incredible, but the supporting cast of Reeves, Hopkins and Ryder are terrific, Winona Ryder&apos;s delicate character is superb. The accompanying soundtrack was also fantastic, great songs from Annie Lennox.

Drácula,Centuries-old vampire Dracula preys upon the innocent Eva and her friends.,"It is hard to say which is the better version of the Todd Browning version and this, both have flaws but both has many things to recommend. There are things here that are done better here than in Browning&apos;s, like some of the storytelling and how it was made, but Browning&apos;s had the better Eva/Mina, Van Helsing and especially Dracula(the Renfield interpretations personally rank the same).

Visually this version is an absolute treat, the cinematography is superb and the editing is much improved over Browning&apos;s version as is George Melford&apos;s exciting direction over Browning&apos;s, the sets are wonderfully Gothic too, especially the genuinely creepy Trasylvanian castle. Of individual scenes the standouts were the smoke with Dracula rising out of his coffin, Renfield and the fly and the terrific final shot. The eerie music score compliments the atmosphere beautifully and the dialogue flows reasonably well.

The storytelling is very compelling on the whole, as well as those three standout scenes the relationship between Eva and Seward is incredibly affecting, the atmosphere is very spooky, there is an exciting climax and it does make more sense than Browning&apos;s with things better explained thanks to the stronger editing. It is not perfect this said, the film is overlong and does drag as a result as expanding on these loose ends, the first scene with Dracula is scarier in the Browning film. The acting is a mixed bag, with the strongest performances being Lupita Tovar as a lively Eva, José Soriano Viosca&apos;s sympathetic Seward and particularly the chillingly insane Renfield of Pablo Álvarez Rubio. Eduardo Arozamena plays Van Helsing more than reliably if not as memorable as Edward Van Sloan or Peter Cushing. Barry Norton however is very stiff as Juan and Carlos Villarias tries far too hard as Dracula, his facial expressions verging on cartoonish and he lacks the aristocratic charisma and suave menace that Bela Lugosi and Christopher Lee had.

All in all, a worthy version but a long way from perfect.

Dracula&apos;s Daughter,"When Countess Marya Zaleska appears in London, mysterious events occur leading Dr. Von Helsing to believe the Countess must be a vampire.","Dracula&apos;s Daughter is a Universal monster movie made in 1936, picking up where the original Dracula left off. The opening scene has the police discovering that Dr. Van Helsing has just staked Count Dracula. The plot moves quickly on with two strands, one involving a friend of Van Helsing.....Dr. Jeffrey Garth....in pursuit of defending his colleague and the other strand involving the daughter of Dracula....Marya Zaleska....in London trying to rid herself of her family curse finding it an impossible task. The two strands finally meet and intertwine. The movie has some rather obvious shortcomings. One is Otto Kruger, whom is irritating as one reviewer earlier stated. He is lacklustre and pompous in a very hollow way. The film also lacks a credible story line and is given in to the temptation of assuming a great deal from the viewer. However, Dracula&apos;s Daughter still is a very enjoyable film. It has wonderful atmosphere, grand sets(particularly when in Translyvania), and a good performance from Holden as the lead and Van Sloan in a reprise of his role as the good doctor Van Helsing. Above all it has a wonderfully eerie, disturbing, and macabre performance from Irving Pinchel as the servant of the female vampire. He is her reminder of what she is, and he never lets her forget that curse which forces her to live by night and sleep by day.",,"['Drama', 'Fantasy', 'Horror']","['female vampire', 'london england', 'van helsing character', 'monster movie', 'universal monsters']",1936-05-11,['Lambert Hillyer'],"['Otto Kruger', 'Gloria Holden', 'Marguerite Churchill']","['Garrett Fort', 'John L.

The Draughtsman&apos;s Contract,A young artist is commissioned by the wife of a wealthy landowner to make a series of drawings of the estate while her husband is away.,"Hugely enjoyable, if somewhat a tad too clever for its own good. A very good English director&apos;s attempt to be more continental, by being deliberately obscure, and throwing in large dollops of raunchy eroticism. Imagine if you will an episode of PBS&apos;s Mystery set during the Restoration, with a script by Einstein, and direction by Frederico Fellini.

Two excellent stage actors - Anthony Higgins and Janet Suzman - in combination with the very sultry and seldom seen Australian actress Anne Louise Lambert, act their sexy sox off in this delightful delicate pastry of a movie. In the year 1694 an artist is commissioned to create a series of precise drawings of an enormous country house. The twist is that his agreed form of payment is most unusual.

Michael Nyman&apos;s score is a careful, yet loud, modern arrangement with contemporary wind and string instruments. The photography by Curtis Clark is incredible, and these two creative artists convince you, you are in the 17th Century. The interior scenes are lit only by candlelight - as was also the case in Kubrick&apos;s superb historical masterpiece Barry Lyndon. This movie somehow combines elements of sophisticated themes of woman&apos;s self-empowerment, the inhumanity of the aristocracy, mathematics, and Benny Hill eroticism. Really rather wonderful and unique, but also in-retrospect, less than the sum of its parts. For a superior Peter Greenaway picture, try Drowning By Numbers, A Zed and Two Naughts, and The Cook, the Wife, etc..",8,"['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Mystery']","['sex scene', 'deception', 'england', 'artistic creation', 'period drama']",1982-11-12,['Peter Greenaway'],"['Anthony Higgins', 'Janet Suzman', 'Anne-Louise Lambert']",['Peter Greenaway']
The Dreamers,A young American studying in Paris in 1968 strikes up a friendship with a French brother and sister. Set against the background of the &apos;68 Paris student riots.,"My rating: 6/10

There are two types of dreamers in `The Dreamers&apos;: the three main characters, who create their own interior world and prefer to view the outside world by watching classic 1930s cinema; and the socialist street revolutionaries of riot-torn 1968 Paris, who attempt to overthrow the political and economic power structure. `The Dreamers&apos; focuses more on the former than the latter, and Bernardo Bertolucci is careful to leave his film open to interpretation, but ultimately the dream world of the three main characters is shattered by the realities of life. The film ends before resolving the outcome of the second set of dreamers, but we all know our history. Some may think it a shame that the dreamers fail, but others like myself will view it as something that has to happen, if the dream is unrealistic and unsustainable.

The relationship between the three main characters is unlike anything that I&apos;ve ever seen portrayed on film. The twins, Isabelle and Theo, are almost as close to each other in young adulthood as they were during the nine months they spent together in their mother&apos;s womb. Matthew, a U.S. student studying abroad in Paris, inserts himself into the middle, and when he receives early indications that portend the depth of the relationship between the twins, he does not run away. To me, this required too much suspension of disbelief, but I&apos;m certainly aware that others have different proclivities. If Bertolucci&apos;s intent was to show a high degree of separation between his three dreamers and the rest of society, he certainly succeeded.

The three dreamers have some, but ultimately too little, awareness of their separation from reality and the unsustainable nature of the world they create. While sympathizing with the revolutionaries in the street, they actually are the ultimate materialistic consumers: they produce nothing that they consume (neither food nor art), and when the money their parents provide runs out, and they&apos;ve drained most of the wine cellar, the harsh realities of life set in. Rooting through trash heaps isn&apos;t the answer, and the choices that they leave themselves in the end (self-annihilation or nihilism), I believe, show just how flawed their ideal world is. My interpretation is that this lesson also applies to the other set of dreamers, the street revolutionaries, but those who even today sympathize with the views of those revolutionaries will reject this interpretation.

`The Dreamers&apos; is very voyeuristic, and Bertolucci puts his three leads through some incredibly intimate moments. All three leads are quite good, with Eva Green in particular deserving special notice for a completely uninhibited performance (at least the two male leads had each other&apos;s example to follow). It&apos;s hard to come up with an accurate overall rating for this film, because I think there will be a widespread variance in how different people react to both the storyline and the images. Read the reviews carefully, and if it sounds like something that interests and won&apos;t shock you, then give it a try. My middle-of-the-road rating is mainly due to my not being terribly interested in the type of relationship formed by the three main characters.",6,"['Drama', 'Romance']","['menage a trois', 'brother sister relationship', '1960s', 'female full frontal nudity', 'french']",2004-02-20,['Bernardo Bertolucci'],"['Michael Pitt', 'Louis Garrel', 'Eva Green']",['Gilbert Adair']

Dredd,"In a violent, futuristic city where the police have the authority to act as judge, jury and executioner, a cop teams with a trainee to take down a gang that deals the reality-altering drug, SLO-MO.","Seventeen years ago, a Sylvester Stallone sci-fi action vehicle was released into the world under the title &apos;Judge Dredd&apos;. Based on the character from the popular 2000AD comic book series, the film was a huge disappointment with critics and a source of much heartache for Dredd devotees in the way it seemed to blatantly disregard crucial aspects of the source mythology both in look and tone. Fast forward to present day, a world in which comic book characters mean big money for film studios, surely enough time has passed to give the old Judge another crack of the whip right? I&apos;m happy to say fans of the comic book should be able to relax and enjoy this much darker and tougher representation of their much loved character. Although the film, and it&apos;s (permanently) helmeted protagonist is a straightforward and simple beast, it actually works all the better for it. Dredd isn&apos;t given a back story or imbued with much in the way of humanity, he&apos;s instead portrayed more as the mysterious &apos;man with no name&apos; whose dialogue is limited to one-liners that usually precedes some serious ass kicking. Where the 1995 Judge film was light and comedic, this version is hardcore and extremely violent with some surprising explosions of brutality meted out in a world that&apos;s long since gone to hell. As is pleasingly more and more the case in mainstream action cinema, we have strong female representation in Olvia Thirlby as Dredd&apos;s rookie sidekick and a nasty Lena Headey on form and fresh from bad girl duties in the celebrated TV series Game Of Thrones. Dredd 3D can&apos;t and won&apos;t be considered a classic of the genre, but it&apos;s a huge step-up from the Stallone version and should satisfy any and all sci-fi action fans looking for a fun Friday night thrill. Visually arresting and with a sensible running time, Dredd rocks. 3.5/5",8,"['Action', 'Crime', 'Sci-Fi']","['post apocalypse', 'cyberpunk', 'dystopia', 'based on comic', 'drugs']",2012-09-21,['Pete Travis'],"['Karl Urban', 'Olivia Thirlby', 'Lena Headey']","['John Wagner', 'Carlos Ezquerra', 'Alex Garland']"

Drums Along the Mohawk,Newlyweds Gil and Lana Martin try to establish a farm in the Mohawk Valley but are menaced by Indians and Tories as the Revolutionary War begins.,"Awesome and marvelous Western by the great John Ford and deemed by many to be his early best . 1776 , in American revolutionary , Albany , Gilbert &apos;Gil&apos; Martin (Henry Fonda who was real descendant of the Fondas that settled in the Mohawk Valley in the mid 17th Century) marries the beautiful Magdelana &apos;Lana&apos;, shortly before the revolutionary war , and takes her West to begin a homestead in the Mohawk Valley , in Upstate New York . There took place bloody battles as Battle of German Flats in the Mohawk Valley as part of the loyalist Butler&apos;s Rangers , and the Battle of Oriskany . As they settle their homestead when the war begins and both of whom become involved into a terrible conflict . As both sides battle relentlessly supported by Indians , as the Iroquois Confederation was split in its loyalties during the Revolution , the Oneidas sided with the Americans while the Mohawks and Senecas joined with the Hurons and Nipissing First Nation , Ojibwas and Algonquins on the side of the instigating British . For the next six years Gilbert battles in the war and while they attempt to establish their homestead . But it to be on fire and the young farmers , then , move and meet a grumpy old widow , Mrs. Mc Klennar (Edna May Oliver) , who is happy to put them up in her farm in exchange for help from both of them . Later on , Gil joins the minutemen , and after that , Indians commanded by the nasty Brit Caldwell (John Carradine) burn the farms and attack the rebellious colonists on a fort that is really besieged . But the violence and destruction of war catch up , and even the fort isn&apos;t guaranteed safe . And Gilbert carries out a long marathon foot leg through an Indian gauntlet . 

One of John Ford&apos;s early Western hits , it has come remarkable Colour cinematography by Bert Glennon and Ray Rennahan , dealing with pioneers hardships , and the expected , violent as well as impressive scenes about the Redskin siege . This nice and superb Western contains thoughtful characters , full of wide open space and dramatic moments . Outdoors are pretty good and well photographed , story first-rate and powerful told too . Here John Ford and Henry Fonda reached the peak of their successful and fundamental screen collaboration . Thought-provoking , insightful screenplay portraying in depth characters and brooding events with interesting issues running beneath script surface . Over-the-top Western with trigger-taut drama , perfectly written by Lamar Trotti and uncredited collaboration by Nobel winner William Faulkner , being based on on the Walter Edmonds novel . The film relies heavily on the extremely sentimental relationship between the young marriage : Lana/Claudette Colbert and Gilbert Martin/Henry Fonda . Fine acting from Henry Fonda as a civilized man from the East coast colonies who finds himself a loving bride , and attractive Claudette Colbert who keeps her upper lip pretty stiff but she looses their expected baby . ¨Drums along the Mohawk¨ gets to ensemble a magnificent supporting cast , plenty of familiar faces , and Ford&apos;s regulars , such as : Edna May Oliver , John Carradine , Ward Bond , Francis Ford , Eddie Collins , Arthur Shields , Robert Lowery , Jessie Ralph , Jack Pennick , Russell Simpson and Chief John Big Tree . This classic and moving picture ranks as one of the main of John Ford&apos;s works , including settings , interpretations , cinematography all extraordinary . It contains Ford&apos;s usual themes as familiar feeling , a little bit enjoyable humor , friendship and sense of comradeship but also some cynicism and full of wide open spaces with breathtaking landscapes exceptionally filmed from Cook County , Pennsylvania , Aspen Mirror Lake , Duck Creek Village , Strawberry Point , Dixie National Forest, Wasatch Range , Cedar Utah USA . Furthermore , a sensitive , romantic and thrilling at times , musical score by the classic composer Alfred Newman . 

Marvelously shot Ford film with a lively look at the complex world of the colonialists , pioneers versus Indians , and adventure romance . This solid as well as patriotic motion picture was well directed , this is a grand , cunningly crafted entertainment , action-filled and jingoist saga about revolutionary America . Ford&apos;s prior and subsequent films to get great successes as ¨The stagecoach¨ , ¨The young Mr. Lincoln¨ and the cavalry trilogy as ¨Fort Apache¨, ¨They wore yellow ribbon¨ and ¨Rio Grande¨. And , his posterior ¨Two rode together¨ has a similar plot to ¨The searchers¨ though the Ford&apos;s vision about West is pretty cynical and less idealist .",7,"['Drama', 'Romance', 'War']","['colonial america', 'fort', 'native american attack', 'based on novel', 'musket']",1939-11-10,['John Ford'],"['Claudette Colbert', 'Henry Fonda', 'Edna May Oliver']","['Lamar Trotti', 'Sonya Levien', 'Walter D.

Drums in the Deep South,Two old friends find themselves on opposite sides during the Civil War in a desperate battle atop an impregnable mountain.,"I had a really hard time figuring out whether to give this a 5 or a 6. The film has a few things going for it but on the other hand it has some definite problems. I finally settled on a 6. I gave it a point for quirkiness.

The casting of James Craig was obviously intended to evoke Clark Gable and Rhett Butler. Too obviously. Craig&apos;s vocal performance seemed to indicate that he also wanted to play up the Clark Gable angle. It was a bit distracting during the love scenes but he seemed to, thankfully, drift away from it during the action sequences.

Guy Madison was cast because he was easy to look at. But his performance was anything but easy to look at. His character gyrated wildly from manic damnyankee enemy to soft hearted friend of the family. I couldn&apos;t tell if he was possessed or just in serious need of some mood stabilizing drugs.

I never developed an empathy with the leading male and female characters. Every time they passionately kissed I kept thinking about her poor naive husband off surrounded by Sherman&apos;s Army while she played footsie with his alleged old best West Point friend.

The special effects were very interesting and quite well done. But its hard to imagine that anybody ever grew any cotton in the rocky scrub that looked remarkably like Southern California during wildfire season. If you are going to spend the special effects money to matte in a giant plantation house you can at least matte it into a rich green landscape rather than a rocky gulch.

I won&apos;t even mention (well actually I will) the fact that the main geographical feature of the movie is a hollowed out, honeycombed, Devil&apos;s Tower from Close Encounters. Only this one is smack dab in the middle of Georgia! The makers of this movie would have had better luck just using the real Stone Mountain and pretended it was hollow. I kept expecting the mother ship to hover over the mountain.

The explosive ending seemed to be the result of the writer suddenly realizing that he had to finish his script in the next two sentences. I can&apos;t say I&apos;ve seen a film that only needs 2 seconds to wrap everything up and turn off the lights.

But there are a few good things that made this movie appealing. Your generic Civil War movie has a smashing good Cavalry charge in it and lots of dashing guys on horses waving swords and flags. You know they do. This film went WAY off the beaten path. The heroes of this film are the artillery.....yes....you heard it right.....the heroes are exclusively the Confederate Artillery. That deserves a rating point right there. They even got the Confederate artillery uniform colors right. Its not often you see a Civil War film where the difference between a Dahlgren gun and a Brooke&apos;s Rifle is essential to the plot. The artillery battles were handled quite skillfully.

This is essentially a fifties matinee action picture. But the makers did manage to insert a couple of quite beautiful moments into the film. For a moment, a hard-hearted, oppressive, damnyankee skulker becomes human when he presents a photograph of his two babies and thinks wistfully of his family and his farm. More than one character mentions that he didn&apos;t start the war, that he was just playing the role assigned to him on the great stage. A few quiet moments about the war&apos;s real meaning and effect in this odd little shoot &apos;em up.",6,['Western'],"['1860s', 'damsel in distress', 'deception', 'infidelity', 'song']",1951-10-16,['William Cameron Menzies'],"['James Craig', 'Barbara Payton', 'Guy Madison']","['Philip Yordan', 'Sidney Harmon', 'Hollister Noble']"
Zui quan,"Wong Fei-Hung is a mischievous yet righteous young man, but after a series of incidents his frustrated father has him disciplined by a master of drunken martial arts.","This is one of the quality films from Jackie&apos;s early years made the year after Snake in Eagles Shadow with much of the same cast and crew this built on the comedic style of Kung Fu action that Jackie was to make his own. Of the two films I actually prefer the earlier Snake in.... but its this later film that is more often considered Chan&apos;s earliest masterpiece.

This is a more traditional set kung-fu film than the later stunt fests that made his name. The fighting styles on show are unique, inventive and fascinating to watch. The showdowns are impressive and with no trick photography, CG or massive effects fueled blow outs and shows just how good a martial artist Jackie is. The comedy works well and Jackies on screen master is very funny and they spark well off each other as a team.

This is a really good old style kung fu flick fans of Jackies later work such as Rush Hour etc. may not find what their looking for here this is Jackie in one of his most pure kung fu movies. But for anyone who loves martial arts you must see this!!

Duel in the Sun,"Beautiful, biracial Pearl Chavez becomes the ward of her dead father&apos;s first love and finds herself torn between two brothers, one good and the other bad.","David O. Selznick spent the rest of his life trying to top Gone With the Wind. What other mountains did he have to climb after making the most acclaimed motion picture ever? 

In addition he had another obsession, his second wife Jennifer Jones. He was going to make her the greatest leading lady in the history of film. 

Well he didn&apos;t succeed at either, but it wasn&apos;t for lack of trying. Jones herself was in a peculiar position similar to her husband&apos;s. She got an Oscar for her first feature film after she changed her name from Phyllis Isley to Jennifer Jones. Selznick knew that she couldn&apos;t play saints all her life as she did in The Song of Bernadette. So for this western answer to Gone With the Wind as Pearl Chavez she plays about as opposite a character from Bernadette Soubirous as you can get.

Duel in the Sun got mixed reviews by the critics, but the public ate it up. It&apos;s the story of the McCanless family, parents Lionel Barrymore and Lillian Gish and sons Joseph Cotten and Gregory Peck. Cotten is the good son, Peck the bad one. In fact as Lewt McCanless Peck played his worst character until Josef Mengele in Boys from Brazil.

A kissing cousin of their&apos;s Jennifer Jones comes to live with them. She&apos;s the offspring of an old beau of Lillian&apos;s, Herbert Marshall and the Indian wife he ran off with back in the day. Lillian and Herbert were kissing cousins also.

As Pearl Chavez, Jen gets the McCanless boys testosterone going into overdrive. Take one look at her and you can hardly blame them.

One of the not so hidden subtexts of Duel in the Sun is racism. Jennifer&apos;s good for a quick roll in the hay, but marriage is out of the question, at least for Gregory Peck. Barrymore&apos;s and Peck&apos;s racism is overt, the others not quite so, but it&apos;s still there. 

The negotiations with Louis B. Mayer for Lionel Barrymore must have been interesting. Selznick&apos;s former wife was Irene Mayer, Louis&apos;s daughter.

One thing with Selznick, he spared no expense. He got the best in talent for this film. Dimitri Tiomkin did the score, King Vidor the direction, Ray Rennahan the color photography which is absolutely stunning. 

He even got Bing Crosby to record Gotta Get Me Somebody to Love with Les Paul&apos;s guitar. Peck sang it in the film, Crosby&apos;s record sold a few platters.

He even got Orson Welles to do the off-screen narration if you don&apos;t recognize that voice. 

It misses being a classic mainly because Selznick couldn&apos;t keep his hands off it. Sometimes the acting is about as subtle as a sledgehammer from all the performers. I&apos;m willing to bet it&apos;s Selznick more than Vidor.

Yet it&apos;s good entertainment and Duel in the Sun does have its moments.",6,"['Drama', 'Romance', 'Western']","['brother brother conflict over a woman', 'texas', 'blockbuster', 'brother versus brother', 'astronomical object in title']",1947-11-21,"['King Vidor', 'Otto Brower', 'William Dieterle']","['Jennifer Jones', 'Joseph Cotten', 'Gregory Peck']","['David O.

However, anyone au fait with the genre will identify many of the film&apos;s gory highlights as being stolen from earlier movies by Lenzi&apos;s contemporaries Ruggero Deodato and Sergio Martino. This is a shame, since the story has loads of potential and could have been developed nicely without resorting to pilfering footage.

Sheila, a rich young heiress from Alabama, is searching for her sister Diana, who has gone missing. When she discovers that Diana has been brainwashed by Jonas, a Jim Jones-style cult leader, and is living in a compound in the jungles of New Guinea, she enlists the help of Vietnam veteran Mark and ventures into the New Guinea wilderness on a rescue mission. But freeing Diana is a tougher job than it at first seems: the cultists will not let her go without a fight and the surrounding area is inhabited by cannibals. Only with the help of native woman Mowara can they hope to escape.

In addition to the gore, Lenzi packs his film with plenty of nudity from his female stars and includes some entertaining and gratuitous sex scenes: Mowara (Me Me Lai) is gang-banged amidst her recently deceased husband&apos;s ashes and spends most of her time topless; Janet Agren, who plays Sheila, is defiled by Jonas wielding a blood coated dildo; and Diana (Paola Senatore) gets it doggy-style from a randy cannibal.

Shot on a shoe string budget as a real labor of love it is still one of the most entertaining black comedies ever made. Bartel himself co-stars with the tasty Mary Woronov (Warhol&apos;s &apos;Chelsea Girls&apos;), who he had previously acted with in the wonderful romp &apos;Rock&apos;n&apos;Roll High School&apos; among other things. They show lots of on screen chemistry and make a delightful team, something they obviously realized themselves as they went on to work together several times after this. However they were never better together than in this movie as the uptight but sweet Blands. The Blands have ambitions to open up their own restaurant but have limited means at their disposal. By accident they stumble across a way to get the cash they need using swingers whom they detest. All goes to plan until they encounter the shady locksmith Raoul (Robert Beltran, best known now to Trekkers worldwide). Things then start to get a little more complicated. The three actors seem to love working together and this gives the movie an added zest. The script in witty and unpredictable, and there are some funny bits from the supporting cast, especially Pee-wee Herman sidekick John Paragon as a pushy sex store clerk, and Ed Begley, Jr (&apos;Meet The Applegates&apos;) as a horny hippie.

Eddie Murphy: Raw,Eddie Murphy in a stand-up performance recorded live. For an hour and a half he talks about his favourite subjects: sex and women.,"I&apos;m not kidding, my stomach is sore from all the laughing. After a brief sketch that serves as a lead-in and to some extent, a setup, this is 77 minutes of pure and gradually increasing hilarity(and there is actually insight to a ton of what he says). This and Hot Fuzz(which had the greater effect on me, but you really can&apos;t compare these) are the only two things where I&apos;ve ever felt like I might croak, that my (23-year old and trim as of writing this, mind you) body might be overwhelmed from my enjoying the crap out of what I was seeing and hearing. I love Murphy when he is allowed to do what he does best, and not asked to do it in an irritating manner. The man has a machine-gun for a mouth(in the sense that it can fire off absolutely lethal verbal projectiles at such a speed that counting them soon becomes an exercise in pointless behaviour) and he can behave arrogantly as well as self-deprecating(if the scales aren&apos;t necessarily equal). His impersonations are excellent, and Bill Cosby, Richard Pryor(R.I.P.), Michael Jackson(R.I.P.), Africans, Jamaicans, Italians, etc. must have been embarrassed, if they don&apos;t have(or had in those 2 cases) a sense of humor about themselves. This is a performance by Eddie, and like other stand-uppers, he ties it together and repeats certain punchlines. The whole thing keeps to an astounding pace(with very few exceptions), and flies by. This is filmed and edited with skill, evident especially in the fact that you don&apos;t notice it; it doesn&apos;t draw attention to itself, and off the man. There are stereotypes in this, and it is in general quite controversial. The main focus is on relationships, women and sex, though he does talk about gay people, us whites and our inability to dance, and there is a brief bit of bodily function jokes. There is a constant stream of strong language in this.

Eegah,"Teenagers stumble across a prehistoric caveman, who goes on a rampage.","This. Movie. Hurts. A LOT!

In the early 1960s, bug-eyed space cadet Roxy drives out into the desert and directly into the path of a club-wielding giant with a fake beard glued to his face. It&apos;s EEGAH, a poor caveman who has somehow survived the Neanderthal age and is living just outside of L.A. in a cardboard cave. No one believes Roxy&apos;s tale, except for her incredibly greasy dad and her icky boyfriend. Dad decides to hike out into the desert to see if he can discover the truth behind Eegah, but when he is late coming home, Roxy and icky boyfriend Tom drive out in their wacky dunebuggy to search for him. Soon, Roxy and her dad are held prisoner in Eegah&apos;s garbage bag-draped cave and Tom must find them before Roxy falls victim to a caveman&apos;s lust!

Gag. This is pretty bottom-of-the-barrel godawful stuff. It&apos;s silly, goofy, stupid and cheap, and at it&apos;s worst it makes for some pretty uncomfortable viewing. See Roxy shave daddy and Eegah! See Roxy try to pry herself out of Eegah&apos;s slimy embrace whilst sweaty dad looks on and does nothing! Ugh, it&apos;s pretty gross. Even the MST3K version is hard to sit through, even though Joel and the Bots do their best to make the nauseating sequences more bearable. There&apos;s some decent music in here for fans of 1960s beach-twisty crud, and fans of schlock will be delighted to see a cameo appearance by Ray Dennis Steckler and then- wife Carolyn Brandt as the Couple By The Pool. But other than that, this film has little to offer in the way of entertainment and may only be appreciated by true hardcore fans of bad movies.",2,"['Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Fantasy']","['caveman', 'eating with one&apos;s fingers', 'bearded man', 'neanderthal', 'cave painting']",1965-04-01,['Arch Hall Sr.'],"['Arch Hall Jr.', 'Marilyn Manning', 'Richard Kiel']","['Bob Wehling', 'Arch Hall Sr.']"

Election,,"For some reason, this film has always brought a laugh to the bottom of stomach. Some people may call it boring due to the fact its not some gross-out teen comedy, but this is really the antithesis of a great satire. One can&apos;t see the scaly nature of politics simply because its always drowned in newspeak and bad reporting. But to see it at this level of understanding, it proves to be quite entertaining. It also provides a precursor to our most recent (2000) election. We have the longtime politician, the incompetent who people like, and the iconoclast who wants to shake up government. And of course, there is the cheating regulator who gets the wrong person elected for his own slimy means. Who would have guessed life would imitate art. A great film for all to see.

Elf,"Raised as an oversized elf, Buddy travels from the North Pole to New York City to meet his biological father, Walter Hobbs, who doesn&apos;t know he exists and is in desperate need of some Christmas spirit.","This is the kind of Christmas movie you should be watching every 25th of December apart from your usuals. It&apos;s a wonderful story, with a strong Will Ferrell, playing an innocent, child-like, distracted elf who has no idea how the real world functions, as he is on the quest to search for his real family. He is willing to spread the Christmas spirit on a city which apparently hasn&apos;t got the spark in its eyes, so there is a hard task on his hands.

The rest of the cast is wonderfully completed by Zooey Deschanel, James Caan, Mary Steenburgen, Daniel Tay, with Peter Dinklage and Bob Newhart in small roles. Ferrell definitely steals the movie; and his troubled relationship with his father (Caan) provides some funny and touching moments as well. Jon Favreau did quite a good job from the director&apos;s chair, turning this seemingly childish film into a marvelous choice for your Christmas movies of every year. Some even regard it as a classic, but well, I will let you be the judge of that.",8,"['Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Family']","['elf', 'christmas', 'father son relationship', 'santa claus', 'christmas movie']",2003-11-07,['Jon Favreau'],"['Will Ferrell', 'James Caan', 'Bob Newhart']",['David Berenbaum']

Emmanuelle,"The wife of a French diplomat in Bangkok, Emmanuelle embarks on a voyage of sexual discovery.","Going into this film, the only thing that I was really worried about was that it might be boring. It&apos;s not that I particularly have anything against pornography; but what&apos;s taboo now and what was taboo over three decades ago are different things, and besides that; you can only watch people having sex for so long before it begins to get dull. However, I was wrong; the film isn&apos;t boring, and while the focus is usually on sex; there actually is a story, and it actually is quite interesting! The film is unlikely to appeal to people that are interested in the more perverted side of sex as the film doesn&apos;t feature anything above lesbian sex, but the tender way that the story is presented as well as the French style give it a very erotic feel throughout. The plot, as you might expect, focuses on the character &apos;Emmanuelle&apos;, a young woman that lives with her husband; an older man, in Bangkok. They share a sort of teacher-pupil relationship, and they&apos;re also very liberal where adultery is concerned, as neither one cares too much about the other&apos;s antics with other people.

This film inspired a barrage of slightly less tasteful sequels, as well as a range of Italian films, many of which were directed by sleaze God Joe D&apos;Amato. I don&apos;t think the filmmakers intended Emmanuelle to be associated so closely with sleaze, and actually at times; it doesn&apos;t really feel like a porn film; more of a drama with sex. I&apos;ve got no idea how many taboos this film broke upon it&apos;s release over three decades ago, but the fact that it doesn&apos;t really break many today does it a favour where class is concerned as the film never feels too dirty, and this bodes well with the high class of the lead characters and setting. Sylvia Kristel takes the lead role, and is believable as a sexually naive young woman. She is joined by a number of eye-pleasing actresses, including Christine Boisson and Marika Green, and all get to take their clothes off in several scenes. The settings in which it all takes place are pleasing also, and the film is of a much higher class than a lot of nowadays porn. I&apos;m surprised that Emmanuelle still has a notorious reputation, as it&apos;s only soft-core at best; but it&apos;s definitely worth seeing, if only to see how much things have changed!",7,"['Drama', 'Romance']","['extramarital affair', 'multiple lovers', 'sex on a table', 'voyeurism', 'caressing']",1974-12-03,['Just Jaeckin'],"['Sylvia Kristel', 'Alain Cuny', 'Marika Green']","['Emmanuelle Arsan', 'Jean-Louis Richard']"
Emperor of the North Pole,"In 1933, during the Depression, Shack the brutal conductor of the number 19 train has a personal vendetta against the best train hopping hobo tramp in the Northwest, A No. 1.","There were just so many great B movies made in the 70s and this is one of the best. Stark and cruel but completely watchable and with two excellent male leads, this brutal hobo railroad drama remains fixed in most viewers minds forever. It is also part of two great sub genres...the depression years drama and the railroad thriller. So many films to choose from in either genre and practically all watchable and enjoyable. EMPEROR was released for about 10 days and never surfaced again. I used to add it in as a double feature in my cinema right up until about 1980 and it always commanded major discovery status. The problem is the title: and like DAY OF THE LOCUST or EMPIRE OF THE SUN or other confusing titles the pubic never found it themselves. It failed on first release and was only repeatedly discovered when the public went to a double feature as described above. In Oz it was released only as EMPEROR OF THE NORTH.

End of Days,"At the end of the century, Satan visits New York in search of a bride. It&apos;s up to an ex-cop who now runs an elite security outfit to stop him.","Hyped to the heavens when it first came out as Schwarzenegger&apos;s comeback movie, this 1999 film steers the Governor away from his attempts at comedy and collaborations with Danny Devito and back into the sort of action packed carnage that made his name in the first place. However, where the likes of Commando had him portraying invincible supermen with a neat array of guns and one liners to hand, End of Days is considerably darker.

Set in New York on the eve of Millennium, the film shows a version of the Austrian Oak previously never witnessed. He plays Jericho Cane, an alcoholic ex-Cop in charge of a security squad who finds himself embroiled in a battle to save a young girl (Robin Tunney) from being raped by the devil (a sadly, rather ineffective Gabriel Byrne) and bringing about Armageddon. As you do.

Cane himself is not the best sort of man for saving all creation either. He is mired in deep depression, has abandoned any faith in God he may have once had and when we first see him, is contemplating suicide. However, saving the girl gives him a drive and determination even when faced with some conflicting views from the Catholic Church about how best to go about this. All of this takes place in a very grim and gritty vision of New York where the rain never stops falling, urban decay is rife and pillars of steam rise from manhole covers. It is a fitting location for the end of all creation to begin and cast a dark veil over the flick.

Of course, that isn&apos;t to say the film is all doom and gloom as there are a few glimpses of just how seriously the makers weren&apos;t taking their project (the argument between Arnold and Kevin Pollack in the former&apos;s apartment is hilarious). Plus, while the story and characters are all developed to match the atmosphere of impending dread during the first hour and a half, the last twenty minutes are made up of the kind of explosive action that strangely doesn&apos;t jar against the grimmer nature of the rest of the film, though the CGI devil at the climax is pushing it a little.

All in all, an enjoyable romp for fans of the Governator before his attention was diverted by a political career. It compares well to his classic eighties work by trying to do something different and while it may not gel properly in places, for a good 80% of the running time it does a very entertaining job.",7,"['Action', 'Fantasy', 'Horror']","['new york city', 'devil', 'hobo', 'female nudity', 'lucifer']",1999-11-24,['Peter Hyams'],"['Arnold Schwarzenegger', 'Gabriel Byrne', 'Robin Tunney']",['Andrew W.

Jeder für sich und Gott gegen alle,"A young man named Kaspar Hauser suddenly appears in Nuremberg in 1828, barely able to talk or walk, and bearing a strange note.","Even if this film had failed on the level of character or narrative (which it doesn&apos;t), I would still love this movie for its incredible imagery. The memory/dream sequences are haunting and will never leave my head. The opening shot of a field, long blades grass bowing under the wind to the music of Pachelbel, is extraordinary. And of course there&apos;s the performance of Bruno S, the most intensely hypnotic and genuine performance you will ever see. 

But my favorite scene is of the impresario and the dwarf king and his kingdom. This is a true Herzog moment -- bizarre but somehow still a moment of striking epiphany -- the dwarf a parallel, isolated soul to Kasper&apos;s own isolated, lonely soul. The extremity and weirdness of moments like these seem commonplace and everyday in a Herzog film, and therefore somehow commonplace and everyday even in our own lives.",10,"['Biography', 'Drama', 'History']","['kaspar hauser', '1830s', '1820s', 'mysterious man', 'based on supposedly true story']",1974-11-01,['Werner Herzog'],"['Bruno S.', 'Walter Ladengast', 'Brigitte Mira']","['Werner Herzog', 'Jakob Wassermann']"
Enter the Dragon,A Shaolin martial artist travels to an island fortress to spy on an opium lord - who is also a former monk from his temple - under the guise of attending a fighting tournament.,"Even though it is more than 25 years since Enter the Dragon was first released, to this day it is still hailed as the landmark of martial arts films.

Used primarily as a vehicle for the late, great Bruce Lee this movie has a thin plot, little actual character development and the acting isn&apos;t fantastic.....it was never meant to be another Citizen Kane. Its merit lies purely in the action content. If you were to ask any learned martial artist I&apos;m sure that 9 out of 10 would tell you that the fight sequences are unparalleled, even today. The fluidity of Lee is astounding. Unlike most martial arts films of that time the fighting is very realistic, and has a somewhat visceral quality. There is also the use of traditional Oriental weapons (nunchaku, escrima sticks, etc..), although the British censors in their wisdom have seen fit the cut the nunchaku sequence, and I&apos;m afraid, like any censored movie, it just isn&apos;t the same watching when you know you aren&apos;t getting the full monty, so to speak.

Still, on the whole one of my personal favourites and a must see for any action or seventies film fan.

The Epic of Everest,The official record of Mallory and Irvine&apos;s 1924 expedition.,"This early documentary chronicles a British funded expedition aimed at climbing the highest mountain in the world, Mount Everest, for the very first time. More specifically, this was the famous doomed expedition of 1924 where George Mallory and Andrew Irvine lost their lives somewhere just short of the summit. It remains unknown if they ever made it to the top. Mallory&apos;s body was found over seventy years later in 1999, Irvine&apos;s body has never been found, his ultimate location remaining an enduring mystery.

This is one of those documentaries that you know in advance is going to end in a very bad way. The fate of the climbers is so well documented and was such big news at the time that the vast majority of people approaching this film will be only too aware of the downbeat nature this expedition ended on. The footage was taken by Captain John Noel with a hand cranked camera, which I am sure was a fairly bulky device, making it all the more impressive that this footage was shot at all considering that this heavy equipment would have to have been heaved so far up this most imposing mountain. Much of the climbing material was, by necessity, taken on a long range lens and is consequently quite limited; yet the long distance we see the climbers from gives the imagery a slightly haunting perspective. Nevertheless, there is a considerable amount of stunning photography of mountain vistas and, in general, it captures a feel of what the men saw there. In addition to this, there is some very valuable material captured of the isolated Tibetan people who live in the shadow of Everest. This was the first time they had been captured on film and so this is very nice time-capsule stuff. In fact, most of the smaller more personal details captured in the film are moments from the lives of these people, with actually very little of the climbers themselves. This is a shame, especially considering that this would be the final testament to Mallory and Irvine.

As was probably unavoidable for a silent documentary it relies fairly heavily on title cards to convey information. But this is kind of what you would expect, nevertheless, it doesn&apos;t detract too much and the content generally is fascinating. Visually it has been beautifully restored by the BFI so that the imagery with its expressionistic colour tints can be appreciated in all their glory. Also pleasingly, a modern score has been composed too. For me, this is always a welcome addition to a silent film and in this case it is no different. It&apos;s a subtle minimalistic soundtrack with some live sounds added too for extra atmosphere and ambiance. On the whole, this is a very good bit of restoration work on a very fine old documentary. This is the kind of historical adventure that deserves to have some kind of visual documentation and even though we know it has a sad conclusion; it&apos;s beautiful in many ways.",7,"['Documentary', 'Adventure', 'History']","['mount everest', 'expedition', 'alpinism', 'briton in asia', 'mountain climbing']",,['J.B.L.

Ethel & Ernest,The life and times of the parents of the hailed British graphic novelist Raymond Briggs.,"Having grown up, and loving to bits (still do), the stories and animations of &apos;Father Christmas&apos;, &apos;The Bear&apos; and particularly &apos;The Snowman&apos; and similarly being blown away by &apos;When the Wind Blows&apos; (another seemingly personal work and I couldn&apos;t help being reminded by that when viewing &apos;Ethel & Ernest&apos;), &apos;Ethel & Ernest&apos; is yet another Raymond Briggs masterwork.

This 2016 animated adaptation couldn&apos;t have been more perfectly adapted and is simply sublime also on its own. Its story structure may be somewhat episodic, but actually in no way does that matter at all in this instance. This is due to how brilliantly made &apos;Ethel & Ernest&apos; was and my vast emotional connection with it. Easily a highlight of my festive-period film/television watching.

Like with &apos;Father Christmas&apos;, &apos;The Bear&apos;, &apos;The Snowman&apos; and &apos;When the Wind Blows&apos;, the animation from start to finish is stunning, from the level of detail to the meticulousness of the drawing. Not to mention the quaint and atmospheric colours and the gut-wrenching scenes depicting World War II and how people lived during it. The music is never intrusive yet always has a presence when needed. The use of music and songs from each stage of both characters&apos; lives giving a sense of authenticity and effectively taking one back.

Furthermore, the script has a perfect balance of gentle yet hilarious humour (the funniest lines often coming from Ethel), genuine pathos such as the genuinely heart-rending ending beautifully done and fascinating history that is either educational, takes one back or both (it is somewhat fun to spot the historical figures and events). It also has darker moments (such as the carnage and terror WWII brought) that are quite harrowing and never trivialised and a beautifully pitched, never heavy-handed but admittedly at some time painful honestly. As can be seen, the range of emotions is very wide.

The story is easily the most personal of all Briggs stories and essentially a very affectionate yet compellingly real auto-biographical tribute to his real-life parents. It is a story and tribute that is throughout immensely charming, deeply touching, funny and very honest. It is gripping from start to finish, and with a lot going on but with a gentle pace that allows the events to breathe the hour and a half length feels justified and doesn&apos;t feel too long or the content over-stretched. Structurally it may seem episodic and slight, but the content is very much eventful.

Ethel and especially Ernest themselves are very likable protagonists in all their life stages, while their chemistry and love for one another is very affectionate but sometimes imperfect, a realistic depiction of marriage. Raymond is also charmingly portrayed. While all the vocal cast do a sterling job, Brenda Blethyn and Jim Broadbent are truly outstanding and give Ethel and Ernest remarkably vivid life, making them compellingly real characters and relatable rather than stock or caricatures.

All in all, nothing to fault here, another masterful Raymond Briggs adaptation. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10,"['Animation', 'Drama', 'History']","['based on comic book', 'based on graphic novel', 'crying', 'victory in europe day', 'wartime blackout']",2018-02-20,['Roger Mainwood'],"['Jim Broadbent', 'Brenda Blethyn', 'Luke Treadaway']","['Raymond Briggs', 'Roger Mainwood']"
Europa Report,An international crew of astronauts undertakes a privately funded mission to search for life on Jupiter&apos;s fourth largest moon.,"I liked this movie. It was a good sci-fi flick, but based in a believable near-future world. The voyage is captured by stationary cameras throughout the ship and a story is patched together from them. The acting was very good. There admittedly wasn&apos;t much in the way of character development, but I didn&apos;t notice it. The whole film I was hoping the story would move forward faster and faster to the end, to find out what, if anything, was discovered, and the fate of the crew.

Mostly what I liked about it was that it wasn&apos;t over-the-top storytelling, nor was it over-the-top with special effects. It used them only to tell the story that needed to be told and weren&apos;t overused. One reviewer chastised the special effects as being poor, but I disagree. They were believable. Bad is the crap they make for the Science Fiction Channel.

This movie may not appeal to everyone precisely because it&apos;s not over-the-top. It was simple, with building tension throughout the film and a good ending. There weren&apos;t monsters and aliens everywhere, there was a distinct Hitchcocian feel to it.

Event Horizon,A rescue crew investigates a spaceship that disappeared into a black hole and has now returned...with someone or something new on-board.,"I&apos;ve never written a review before on IMDb but I had to write one for this movie, I thought it was a very standout movie for its time. I&apos;m not a fan of horror movies not because they scare me but because of reused clichés and cliché characters.

It might not seem like a very important movie based on ratings or it&apos;s own trailer but I felt there was a great mix of atmosphere ,survival, horror, suspense with Sci/Fi bridging a gap to a touch of super natural(depends on how you view the outcome as it could just be Sci/Fi only) I felt the movie didn&apos;t go crazy with jump scares , it creeped me out but provided an entertaining premise as well. I&apos;d highly recommend this movie if you haven&apos;t seen it unless you&apos;re not a fan of Sci/Fi or survival",,"['Horror', 'Sci-Fi', 'Thriller']","['spaceship', 'astronaut', 'black hole', 'hell', 'female astronaut']",1997-08-15,['Paul W.S.

This is right up there will Evil Things for me. For all the haters out there have you seen Episode 50 or the Bucks County Massacre? Now those were God awful found footage films. This film hit all the right notes....decent acting, some gore, creepy tension and some great looking villains. Most people who liked this film liked the last 20 minutes the most but I felt different. I enjoyed the first hour much more and thought the less we knew about what the hell was stalking these kids in the middle of the night the better. I felt the last act of the film explained too much but it still worked for me. Evidence reminded me a bit of Chernobyl Diaries meets Zombie Diaries with a twist.

The Evil Dead,"Five friends travel to a cabin in the woods, where they unknowingly release flesh-possessing demons.","The Evil Dead is a film that scared me. In fact, everyone I spoke to has been scared of this film.

This film is one of the great horrors like The Omen, Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Nightmare on Elm Street. There are some truly creepy scenes in the film.

I was not disappointed, once the book is found, it&apos;s non stop. The makeup and sound department went above and beyond to bring fans a hell of a bloody ride.

I can understand that it won&apos;t be for everyone, but if you are a fan of old school body horror you will have a great time.

Evil Things,"On January 9, 2009, five college students left New York City for a weekend in the country. 48 hours later, all five students have simply vanished without a trace. There were no leads and no evidence - until now.","I have nothing against found footage flicks let that be clear but this one here just doesn&apos;t deliver any frights or scary moments. What the makers were trying to do is to make a found footage that has a bit of a Blair Witch Project (1999) look. But this time it just didn&apos;t work out.

I had to wait around 50 minutes before the first weird thing really happens and even that part was rather stupid. You know the feeling, doors being slammed...Before that you have 5 friends meeting each other and going for a anniversary weekend at a house of one&apos;s aunt. But while driving out of New York some van is annoying them. They start filming the van but before they know it the van follows every move they make. But it isn&apos;t scary. Once at the house the van pops in again and they go to the woods, getting lost of course full of weird noises but again, nothing really happens. Once the night vision is switched on on the camera I thought, well now we are going to get it but just when it should happen, the movie is over...I thought. End credits and still over 10 minutes before the end. Oh yes, we do see that the van filmed them too, a thing we already knew from the VHS throughout the flick. And even that part I had something like, were is the evil thing? Well, the last minute we do hear some evil thing, already once heard in this flick. Fim over and I agree, an evil thing to watch. avoid it and that&apos;s a thing I don&apos;t say normally.

The Evil Within,"A lonely, mentally handicapped boy befriends his reflection in an antique mirror. This demonic creature orders him to go on a murderous rampage to kill the people he loves most.","On its own, it was fairly good; not very much to say since I couldn&apos;t help but think about the context. The ending was a little confusing, but if you saw the movie you&apos;d probably be surprised if it wasn&apos;t confusing.

Now for the context. No one&apos;s first film is great or even good, but this was a very good first effort from the writer-director and I think it showed a great natural artistic capability that a longer career would have honed. I was amazed at how good this was for a first film and it&apos;s tragic to think there will never be another movie from this clearly gifted artist.

That being said, if I didn&apos;t know the backstory behind the film, I probably wouldn&apos;t have sought it out, let alone even heard of it, and it&apos;s better to judge a film on its own rather than the context around its making. I acknowledge that I had a bias going into this movie as I went in knowing the tragic story of the writer-director, but the bias should not be judged too harshly as I&apos;ve gone into many movies wanting them to be good and that&apos;s never stopped me from judging them to be bad if they were indeed bad. While The Evil Within is not great, it&apos;s certainly memorable. 6/10 might not sound like a good rating, but I prefer a 4-star scale, with 2 stars being average, not bad but not exactly memorable, and 3 stars being good, and this movie&apos;s in between, so my rating is 2.5/4 stars. A not exactly good but certainly memorable movie, and an incredible first and only film from an untapped talent.",6,['Horror'],"['female full frontal nudity', 'person with a mental disability', 'murder', 'supernatural serial killer']",2017-08-30,['Andrew Getty'],"['Sean Patrick Flanery', 'Dina Meyer', 'Frederick Koehler']",['Andrew Getty']

Gene Raymond plays the love interest, and he&apos;s quite good, a character who is serious and has gravitas.

The cast includes Frank McHugh as a stuffed shirt seemingly oblivious to the attentions of his gorgeous wife, played by Claire Dodd. Monroe Owsley and Kay Strozzi also give good turns as glamorous society types who come between Davis and Raymond. Ex-Lady is not so much sexually suggestive as sexually obvious. Even by pre-code standards, not much is left to the imagination.

Exists,A group of friends who venture into the remote Texas woods for a party weekend find themselves stalked by Bigfoot.,"I&apos;ve seen several big foot movies. The best of them all was The Lost Coast Tapes. Exists is a good big foot movie, and unlike The Lost Coast Tapes, this actually shows the monster. That could be a good or a bad thing, depending on the costumes and special effects used. The Lost Coast Tapes did a great job while not showing the creature, and Exists does a good job showing it. There&apos;s not really much imagination needed when you think of what big foot looks like; tall, hairy, ape or man-like.

I gave this movie a 5-star rating. The acting was pretty good, as were the big foot costumes. When the camper is thrown down the hill, it looks like the people were really inside. 

Some things annoyed me, such as in the cabin, there was a perfectly good cellar that the people didn&apos;t use until they had absolutely no choice. With a monster that is huge and powerful and looking to kill, I think they all would&apos;ve moved down there immediately after finding the cellar. 

Also, when going through the woods, trying to be undetected, Todd kept talking, and Dora wouldn&apos;t stop calling for Matt. Morons. One last complaint. I am so sick of the camcorder POV for these movies. Virtually the entire movie was through the camcorder. They could&apos;ve done this movie just fine without doing that.

I think not. It had in my opinion a very good plot. I thought it was very cool how they went into detail about the past of Father Merrin while still focusing on what Regan is going through, and I&apos;m glad they didn&apos;t do the same monster. I really liked how they set Father Lemont up to have to choose between the angelic Regan and the sinful Regan,and speaking of Regan Linda Blair was awesome. Going back to the end, I love how even though they looked the same and were dressed the same she managed to make the costume work, and make it look like an innocent sort of dress for one, yet at the same time the evil Regan looked sexy in the same dress!All in all I thought it was a darn good sequel and give it a 7/10!",7,['Horror'],"['demon', 'priest', 'teenage girl', 'exorcism', 'african man']",1977-06-17,"['John Boorman', 'Rospo Pallenberg']","['Richard Burton', 'Linda Blair', 'Louise Fletcher']","['William Goodhart', 'William Peter Blatty', 'Rospo Pallenberg']"
The Exorcist III,"A police lieutenant uncovers more than he bargained for as his investigation of a series of murders, which have all the hallmarks of the deceased Gemini serial killer, leads him to question the patients of a psychiatric ward.","William Peter Blatty can really write. Prose and dialogue. No argument. But can he direct a movie? On the strength of &apos;Exorcist III,&apos; yes he can. This isn&apos;t to say that the film doesn&apos;t have its problems. On the contrary, its biggest problem, the out-of-character &apos;crowd-pleasing&apos; SFX climax stops it from being one of the greats. So why do I have a soft spot for this film? If, like me, you appreciate horror films that are both scary and made for grown-ups, &apos;Exorcist III&apos; is refreshing and memorable for its intelligent, non-ironic journey into darkness and for its refusal (bar that ending) to dumb down for the kids. If &apos;Scream&apos; is your idea of a great horror movie, this isn&apos;t one for you! The cast is not nearly young and attractive enough, there are nowhere near enough gags (though Blatty&apos;s dry, sardonic wit is happily in evidence) and the film has no pretensions at being an autopsy of the genre, therefore somehow lifting it above the films it purports to comment on. &apos;Exorcist III&apos; is literary beyond &apos;Scream&apos;s&apos; self-referential trivia-chasing (I would love to hear Detective Kinderman critiquing that movie!) Read &apos;Legion&apos; and you&apos;ll have an idea of how good the film should have been. Flaws acknowledged and accepted, don&apos;t miss out on Brad Dourif&apos;s best performance since &apos;Cuckoo&apos;s Nest,&apos; scene-stealing turns by Ed Flanders and Nancy Fish, or the superlative production design, photography and sound. More than anything else, it&apos;s the atmosphere of the film that stays with me. I can recall very few films that have a better sense of the power of stillness and silence.

Nothing could be further from the truth. This is a sad, painful, mysterious movie that explores human relationships in a very unusual way. Yes, lots of it takes place at a strip club,but it&apos;s not very sexy or explicit. 

You have to pay careful attention to this movie. It bounces around in time, and all the threads of the plot don&apos;t come totally together until the very last moment of the movie. But it has a devastating and gripping payoff. ONLY FOR INTELLIGENT MOVIE GOERS. It&apos;s a tough movie, kinda slow, but it is unusual, inventive and in my opinion, very satisfying.

John (Bob Ginty) is just a working man who clicks and starts to wreck havoc on all the wrongdoers of New York. Christopher George plays detective Dalton who&apos;s about to stop this nutcase that calls himself The Exterminator.

The film.

Despite its strong points The Exterminator is very bland in places. Everything: the dialog, writing, shooting, acting and editing varies from very good to very bad. It stands a step higher than the films of likes of say William Lustig who made films for Glickenhaus&apos; production company. But it&apos;s obvious that the crew didn&apos;t get enough shots to cut the film together to make it look more presentable. At times the movie takes itself way too seriously.

Starts out as a slow low budget movie, turns out to be a fast and mostly effective actioneer. Death Wish it is not, but certainly is worth your time.

The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,A meek Hobbit from the Shire and eight companions set out on a journey to destroy the powerful One Ring and save Middle-earth from the Dark Lord Sauron.,"Simply incredible. Never before have I seen a 3 hour movie that didn&apos;t seem like 3 hours. I read the Lord of the Rings very recently and I was surprised at how similar Peter Jackson&apos;s vision was to my own.

Now about the omissions and alterations. I&apos;m not a crazed fanatic who gets worked up over every little detail. I didn&apos;t mind Arwen&apos;s inflation and I&apos;m actually glad Tom Bombadil was scrubbed (I felt Tom Bombadil was an unnecessary addition to the book). Despite these minor changes, the screenplay stays extremely close to the book and flows very very well (and the prologue was a nice touch).

The acting was flawless. As I&apos;ve read many many times in other reviews, McKellen doesn&apos;t play Gandalf, he IS Gandalf. Wood, Mortensen, Holm, Astin, everyone was fantastic. My hat&apos;s off to Sean Bean who delivers an excellent performance as Boromir, a character who&apos;s intentions are good but wrestles with the corrupting power of the Ring. Bean portrays it VERY well. Oh, and Andy Serkis does a PERFECT Gollum voice. It&apos;s EXACTLY as I imagined it myself.

The special effects were incredible, the cave troll, the balrog, Gollum, and Sauron&apos;s Eye all looked amazing. I was also very impressed by the seamless shrinking of the vertically challenged characters.

What&apos;s wrong with this movie? I have no idea... I thought everything was perfect.

Fame,A chronicle of the lives of several teenagers who attend a New York high school for students gifted in the performing arts.,"Alan Parker&apos;s &apos;Fame&apos; beautifully showcases college-life of eight aspiring artistes. Many seem to have a problem with the open ending and ponder on questions like what happened to Coco after the porn shoot or what happened to Ralph and Doris etc. However, I think this works well as it points to the uncertainty of their future as that&apos;s how life is. The point was to show their struggles during the college years and Parker captures that very well making it easy for the viewers to relate to and bringing a nostalgic feel.

&apos;Fame&apos; starts with some audition scenes which are hilarious. Then it shows which candidates are selected and that&apos;s when the story starts. Though it is labelled a musical drama, it doesn&apos;t follow the traditional musical genre. The songs do not appear out of nowhere. They are well situated within the context of the film and quite nice to listen to. &apos;Fame&apos; also has that wild 70&apos;s feel. If this movie is the last of the 70s then it &apos;rounds&apos; up the decade well.

The actors, most of them in their 20s, do a fine job. There are those who are shy, naive and afraid, those who are wacky, wild and a little reckless and those who put a front but all these characters are striving for their dream which is to become an artiste. The actors brilliantly demonstrate this. I particularly liked Barry Miller, Paul McCrane and Maureen Teefy who play the three close friends and Irene Cara who as the vulnerable singer Coco.

The audio commentary and special features on The Family Jewels provide some interesting information and background about Donna.

Fantastic Mr. Fox,An urbane fox cannot resist returning to his farm raiding ways and then must help his community survive the farmers&apos; retaliation.,"I&apos;ll admit it: I love stop motion animation. From the crude Christmas classics that are always on TV this time of year to the elegant masterpieces of Tim Burton, I never miss the chance to see classic animation at work. Needless to say, when I heard about Fantastic Mr. Fox, I was excited. A wonderful Rhold Dahl book, beautifully crafted animation, and an illustrious cast all in one package – this was exciting. I&apos;m happy to say that my excitement was justified as Fantastic Mr. Fox is perhaps one of the best new movies I have seen this year. 

The story of Fantastic Mr. Fox follows the lives of the Fox family – Mr (George Clooney), Mrs(Meryl Streep), and their son(Jason Schwartzman) – and their animal neighbors and friends. Mr. Fox, once a professional chicken stealer, decides to settle down with his wife after she becomes pregnant and instead take up a career in writing. After moving to a new home in the trunk of a tree, Mr. Fox takes notice in three massive fowl and fruit farms. Risking everything. Mr. Fox decides to embark on one last big job – stealing from all three farms. What happens after that can only be described as pure confusion and debauchery.

As with most Rhold Dahl stories, the book Fantastic Mr. Fox works to both excite kids and humor adults. As a result, the original short story is considered a classic for many families. Though some adaptations of Rhold Dahl classics (see BOTH adaptations of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) have strayed from Dahl&apos;s dry, quirky humor, the film version of one of his best loved stories have honored this side of Dahl&apos;s story, projecting a humor perhaps more suited to adults than children, but creating an overall story that will appeal to all. 

This movie would likely have been impossible without the work of numerous wonderful voice actors. George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray, Willem Dafoe, Michael Gambon, and Owen Wilson all provide voices in the movie, among other lesser known but still wonderfully talented actors. As a result, the voices blend beautifully into the animation. Instead of feeling like characters with a voice shoved in, the voices and the characters are one. 

The animation is perhaps the most appealing aspect of the movie. The script and humor works with the animation in ways traditional or digital animation could not. In many instances, the animation itself provides part of the story. By using a more traditional method, Fantastic Mr. Fox is also able to provide very specific quirks and personalities to each character, something often lost in newer animation. Adding to the animation is a muted, fall palette of colors, giving the entire film a homey, comforting feel. 

Animation has become so perverted in recent years. Throwing away emotional appeal for visual appeal, the plethora of slick, computer animated, shiny films are almost unnerving. In such an atmosphere, choosing to make a use traditional animation can often spell anathema for the film. As a result, Fantastic Mr. Fox shines, choosing to pick traditional animation techniques to allow the viewer to relate to and communicate with the film in a way few films are able to do anymore. Though perhaps not for everyone, I would recommend Fantastic Mr. Fox for anyone interested in quirky humor, stop-motion animation, or simply a beautifully crafted and well written story.",10,"['Animation', 'Adventure', 'Comedy']","['fox', 'stop motion animation', 'farmer', 'puppet animation', 'theft']",2009-11-25,['Wes Anderson'],"['George Clooney', 'Meryl Streep', 'Bill Murray']","['Roald Dahl', 'Wes Anderson', 'Noah Baumbach']"

Father&apos;s Day,"A murderer, a priest, and a delinquent try to bring down a father-killing madman.","You can&apos;t really expect much from this film but for a film that had such a low budget, it was done very well. OK, it&apos;s not a film I would recommend to everybody or anybody really. It is extremely gory, perverse and very weird. But I won&apos;t say I wasn&apos;t entertained.

The hero of the story plays two different characters: a bad-ass you can cheer on and a fool you can laugh at. The supporting characters are all quite similar to the latter but they do have their heroic moments. The villain is pretty much the most vile and disgusting human being I have ever seen on film which does make an example of a true villain when it comes to exploitation films.

The film is presented in a very grindhouse style fashion which is good because we know it actually a b-movie rather than a movie with a big budget to get well known actors and getting a b-movie style. The soundtrack is also very good and fits into the film very well, especially the rock songs.

Overall it&apos;s hard to say much else about this film.

Fatso,"An overweight bachelor is fat, 40 and fed up--to the gills--but when his obese cousin Sal dies at 39, he must finally come to terms with his own weight problem.","Fatso is running on Fox Movie Channel now as I write this. I feel compelled to add my appreciation for this sweet little movie that, as I recall, got creamed by many critics when it came out. 

The pacing IS slow and the story (unlike the theme) slender. Nevertheless, this is a greatly under-appreciated movie. There are many, many funny scenes and lines that are equal to any from more celebrated comedies. The performances are all right on target, especially DeLouise and Bancroft.

I&apos;m here to say you DON&apos;T have to be Italian or from NY to appreciate the movie. However, if you&apos;ve ever struggled with a diet, the movie will resonate with you more than if you&apos;re a lifelong skinny Minnie. You will not soon forget Dom DeLouise&apos;s heartbreak as he listens to a list of restricted foods recited by a severe-looking nurse in his diet doctor&apos;s office. Afterwards, when he has to pick up a birthday cake for his nephew, the camera lingers lovingly on the rows of luscious- looking pastries. His torment is palpable and very, very funny.

However, it&apos;s all a scam -- it was intentionally made in Puerto Rico by these self-same American entrepreneurs to resemble a European flick -- and quite successfully so.

The film is well enough constructed and filmed to be watchable, with plenty of nudity, though it&apos;s overly melodramatic and dully predictable for long stretches. As well, there are a couple of psychedelic sequences for Swinging Sixties buffs. The star Angelique is quite a dish and is not averse to shedding her threads at the least provocation.

Fences,"A working-class African-American father tries to raise his family in the 1950s, while coming to terms with the events of his life.","If I hadn&apos;t known what Fences was going in, I would have been able to tell before any color hit the screen. In a second before the vibrant world of Fences fades into view, the astute theater-goer will recognize the fast-paced almost narrative cadence of two characters talking as lines written for a stage play. Fences is an adaptation of August Wilson&apos;s 1987 play, a part of his Pittsburgh Cycle. It won the Pulitzer Price for Drama in as well as the Tony Award for Best Play, repeating this with the Tony Award for Best Revival of a Play in 2010.

We&apos;re not venturing into mere trivia either, as that revival starred Denzel Washington and Viola Davis (both taking Tonys for their acting). Not only do both reprise their roles in this film, but Denzel Washington directs. This probably explains why Washington puts in such a theater-like performance. For him, it must have felt like stepping into old shoes with very little desire for change. As I alluded, those accustomed with the stage will recognize and probably even like the kind of performance that at all times demands audience attention, as on stage, you have to do exactly that. In movie form, some might confuse it for scene-chewing, but either way, it gives his character a larger than life affability. As is said in the movie, his ability to fill a house could apply as much to his small house in universe as it could to a theater house. It goes a long way to explaining why in the end, these characters have such a strange respect for a man who is such a heinous character.

If it seems like I&apos;m only praising Washington&apos;s performance as relatively good, that might be because he shares the screen with Viola Davis. Davis&apos;s performance is not only more suited for film, a medium she has taken by storm lately, but it&apos;s also transcendentally fantastic in its own right. In one pivotal scene, Davis&apos;s character pours her heart as the actress pours tears and snot down her face. It&apos;s not many movies that I can leave and think, boy, we really should have more snot in our films. When it comes to movies, I like to think of myself as an everyman. I approach the Oscars with a sort of double-speak. There&apos;s the film that should win (Moana), and there&apos;s the film that should win and has a chance (Hell or High Water). In a rare moment of finding these opinions in concert, I could only describe the possibility of Viola Davis not taking home the Best Actress Award with one word: ridiculous.

Denzel Washington certainly doesn&apos;t need to feel upstaged. While August Wilson wrote the screenplay himself before passing away in 2005 (a little uncredited work was done on it by Tony Kushner, who settled for a co-producer credit), it&apos;s still no small feat to take something designed for the small stage putting it on a film screen. A while the film is still more than a bit obvious, I think Washington really did as much as he could to make it as a good a movie as it could be. There are few real scenes and constant talk, but there&apos;s just as much constant motion. Characters walk down a crowded street, transition through the house, come in and off screen organically. It gives a similar effect as if a long scene was done in take. But none of this would matter if it weren&apos;t for the impeccable set design. Taking place in the actual Hill District of Pittsburgh that was so important to Wilson&apos;s stories, the recreation of the 1950s feels almost too alive. The back alley where the eponymous fence is being built is very reminiscent of the set of Rear Window, perhaps smaller in scale, but feeling no less lived in.

Fences is a film built upon quite a pedigree, but what is it about? I believe that Fences is a story about masculinity. In the film, masculinity provides. It helps you ensure that get what you are owed. But masculinity also takes. Troy Maxson (Washington) is an old man obsessed with what he believes the world owes him. The world owed him glory in sports. The world owed him a better profession. A better standard of living. He even believes that the Grim Reaper owes him life. Even though there are legitimate arguments as to why he never obtains these things, we can still say that they are fair wishes. But as the movie progresses, we see that when he tries to take the things he&apos;s owed, he doesn&apos;t necessarily think about who he&apos;s taking from or what they are owed.

Due to its strict adaptation, Fences is extremely dense in its amount of talking compared to other films. The depth this gives to its characters and sheer literature value certainly goes a long way to cement Fences as one of the smartest films of the season. But I have to be a little self-aware and recognize that as a source of entertainment, Fences probably appealed to me mostly as a man who enjoys the stage. Others might not be as indulgent with it as I am.",7,['Drama'],"['adopted child', 'disabled character', 'pulitzer prize source', 'stubborn old man', 'baseball']",2016-12-25,['Denzel Washington'],"['Denzel Washington', 'Viola Davis', 'Stephen McKinley Henderson']",['August Wilson']

Many times the script seemed cliche at best and cheesy at worst. The romantic element of the movie seemed rather overplayed, and as far as a war movie goes, the plot should have relied more heavily on the war and the politics and less on the romance. Frankly, a movie about a bloody battle in the bloodiest war in American history was no place for a romeo and juliet story. The reenactors did an excellent job, the uniforms, weapons, and battlefield effects were very accurate, and the battle itself did a good job of showcasing American military tactics at the time (specifically, the way the tactics resulted in a high death count, something the US learned from very quickly after the war.)

** 1/2 (out of 4) 

I think WWI buffs are going to enjoy this short a lot more than just your casual film fan. The documentary runs just under 25-minutes and pretty much shows us different aspects of the war and how one goes about fighting it. According to the DVD notes, this was shot between February and June of 1916 and released in America shortly after. We get to see images of Scottish and Algerian troops doing a variety of things ranging from digging trenches to doing a battle at night and bombing a village. Director Thompson never tries to tell any type of story or to have the footage shown in any type of storytelling style so what we&apos;ve basically got is just footage thrown together. In terms of entertainment there&apos;s not too much here but I&apos;m sure history buffs are going to be the ones interested in seeing this footage.

The original implications of this lost footage are unclear as it captured the true disgust of the harsh, cramped living conditions, the unsanitary environment, and the famished people within it, while ambiguously presenting staged scenes of Jewish people enjoying a &apos;comfortable&apos; life in the ghetto—dining in restaurants, wearing clean clothes and fine jewelry, enjoying the privacy of their spacious living facilities, sanitary circumcisions, and proper funerals. It almost seemed as if the Nazi filmmaker&apos;s original intent was to present a sort of social or cultural dichotomy within the ghetto. Perhaps a piece of propaganda meant to make people believe the ghettos were acceptable forms of alternative housing—a kind of paradise, but the Jews were the ones who made them unsatisfactory. I found the images within this film to be absolutely haunting. The piercing eyes of these victims as they break the fourth wall, and stare straight back at you will leave you with an unsettling feeling that will linger within you for hours, even after the film&apos;s end. Looking into the sorrowful eyes of these victims is a guaranteed way to make you feel extremely privileged. A Film Unfinished is a heartbreaking look at Nazi inhumanity and manipulation. It is a piece of evidence that will forever represent one of the most tragic events in history.",7,"['Documentary', 'Drama', 'History']","['dead body', 'malnutrition', 'jew', 'warsaw ghetto', 'unfinished film']",,['Yael Hersonski'],"['Alexander Beyer', 'Rüdiger Vogler', 'Hanna Avrutzki']",['Yael Hersonski']

The Final Countdown,"A modern aircraft carrier is thrown back in time to 1941 near Hawaii, just hours before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.","This was a highly entertaining sleeper about a naval ship that happens to go through a time warp and end up at Pearl Harbor just hours before the attack in 1941. Realistic acting, special effects and air scenes really make this movie stand out from other similar movies. I&apos;m really surprised that this film is not more popular, because this was a very unique and fascinating concept for a movie, especially back in 1980. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good science-fiction film. I&apos;m also surprised that it has such a low rating, I was expecting it to be rated at least a 7.

Final Destination 5,Death returns to claim the lucky survivors of a deadly bridge collapse in this fifth frightening installment in the series.,"Most likely, you&apos;re not reading this unless you&apos;re a fan and already plan to see the film. And if you are, then know that my review is based on my fandom and in relation to the series itself. Therefore, it will be in the context of horror films, slasher films, and more importantly, the series itself. With that out of the way, who would have though the fifth film would be the one. Ever since the original, the series has sort of meandered around, trying to recapture the initial wonder of death playing the part of a slasher and killing off a group of people. 

Yes, Final Destination 5 is truly the best sequel since the first. There hasn&apos;t been this much tension and creativity since the original, and practically every scene is filled with an uncomfortable level of anxiety. This is what the film has truly been missing, whether spoiled by the trailers before it or just a lack of creativity. For the most part, Final Destination 3 and 4 (TFD) lacked the necessary level of creativity and menace that was present in the first film, and even in the second. However, we have plenty of that here and a few nice twists as well. While the kills are also pretty ridiculous, most are plausible and, unlike TFD, should please fans with their level of gore and brutality.

The filmmaking qualities here reach above the standard the film has set. It looks great, with plenty of swift and enticing editing that will make your skin crawl with anticipation. The acting, while still not of any award winning caliber, or even really all that great, is decent enough here. The portrayals are more realistic this time around. While the film had though to settle into the I-found-the-answers-on-the-internet routine, here we have a smooth flow in which characters sort of lose their mind trying to figure things out. And while some might have called the main couple&apos;s relationship cringe worthy, I actually found it to be quite well played out as the couple has real issues they work through on top of everything that&apos;s going on. Suffice to say, it&apos;s nice to see the FD series making better attempts at developing it&apos;s characters. Still not great, but better.

With that said, this is Final Destination, and problems persist. Despite better attempts at character development, the majority still play fodder for death&apos;s machinations. Sure, we learn a little about them, but it&apos;s not any more than the bare minimum: this guys a jerk, that girls wild, etc etc. There is also one kill, in particular, that, while brutal, defies logic. Sure, it&apos;s FD, but there is a certain point of ridiculousness where the line is drawn. The characters trying to figure out what&apos;s going on is also getting old. There&apos;s certainly a reason here, which I won&apos;t spoil, why our characters don&apos;t know about what is happening in the same way characters from previous films know. But this leads to the problem of it being explained too quickly. This might contradict what I said above, but what I mean is that Tony Todd&apos;s character if far too quick to reveal information and the new twist. In comparison to FD1, where things had a slow, natural pacing, here we get a couple death scenes, and explanation, and then more death scenes. The progression is better, but still not as good as the first two films. 

Fans will truly enjoy this solid sequel. There are a couple twists, and the final scene will blow everyone away. It&apos;s beyond what you would expect, and very nearly worth seeing the film alone. But with a handful of creative and brutal twists and a decently put together film, this should certainly warrant a decent box office and, maybe unfortunately, another sequel or two.",,"['Horror', 'Thriller']","['suspension bridge', 'gymnast', 'death of protagonist', 'eyeball run over by car', 'fall out window']",2011-08-12,['Steven Quale'],"['Nicholas D&apos;Agosto', 'Emma Bell', 'Arlen Escarpeta']","['Eric Heisserer', 'Jeffrey Reddick']"
Final Exam,A psycho killer shows up on college campus to slash up pretty co-eds and dumb jocks.,"I expected Final Exam to be much better than it was...sadly it turned out to be very boring and not at all gory. People say it&apos;s a Halloween rip-off, well some parts of it are but not many. If you want a Halloween rip-off then watch Offerings, a much better slasher film than Final Exam. The only decent part in this film is when the killer stabs the woman and her blood splatters over her artwork. This is also the closest to gory that this film gets. There is no mystery surrounding the killer whatsoever...in fact towards the end they just start showing his face without even trying to create a sense of mystery. It seems Final Exam was made by the type of people who think that having your killer walk around aimlessly will create suspense. 

I would not recommend this to slasher fans because it&apos;s just too dull.

Finding Vivian Maier,"A documentary on the late Vivian Maier, a nanny whose previously unknown cache of 100,000 photographs earned her a posthumous reputation as one of the most accomplished street photographers.","This documentary is one of a kind. The story of an eccentric, possible mentally ill mystery woman and her prolific photographic work. If the move was just about her art, it would be extraordinary, as her work was. The story of her bizarre and secret life just enhance the film. For a first time effort from John Maloof, this one is very well done. The film starts with those who knew her, openly expressing their amazement to her unknown and mysterious life as a street photographer, filled with the images she kept a secret from everyone. You wonder how someone with her talent could keep it a secret for so long. Maloof plays a significant role in front of the camera as it is necessary for him to tell the story. When it is over, you are still left with a sense of disappointment. You know more about this mystery woman, yet you still crave for more..............And, the images still haunt you. This is one movie I will see numerous times.

The showing I attended had Jeff Garlin participate in a Q & A. It was entertaining as he detailed the process and effort Maloof put in to make this gem of a documentary. 

The added bonus was my friends brother was in the film. Very exciting.

A young woman (Leah Pipes) returns from rehab to her family home, only to encounter the ghost of a little girl who slowly leads her to the lost children and the reason for their disappearance. That part of the movie is OK, and follows modern ghost movie traditions. But some bright bulb apparently decided to also make this a slasher film, with big boobs on display and lots of blood-letting for the JASON and FREDDY crowd. Th slasher segments all tie into the missing children plot, but they were absolutely unnecessary and damn near ruined the movie. We know who the masked killer is way too early, too. Ignore the cheesy slasher scenes, some of which look like they were filmed and inserted as an afterthought, and focus on the ghost plot. You will be rewarded.

Man on Fire,"In Mexico City, a former CIA operative swears vengeance on those who committed an unspeakable act against the family he was hired to protect.","Tony Scott can make good films and bad, personally I think he can be a bit flashy and trashy and his work obviously suffers in comparison with that of his rather famous brother, but this is quite possibly his best film.

What makes this film so great is that Scott gives Denzel (on scorching form, better than Training Day) and the revelation who is Dakota Fanning time to develop a relationship of real warmth and tenderness. The set up is absolutely NOT boring, although it takes time - it is involving, and takes us on a little journey into the characters - including a superb role for Radha Mitchell as the mother. This all serves to make the action so much more effective, as we are so invested in the characters, for all their all too obvious weaknesses. This film has you on the edge for its entirety, and doesn&apos;t cop out at the end either.

The film would of course be nothing without Washington. I often wonder why he seems to get so many duff roles, when he quite clearly is as good as almost any leading man out there (I can only really think of one, Daniel Day Lewis, who has more on-screen power these days). This film should have been huge, given his status and the strength of his performance, and the quality of the film. It just goes to show you that if a studio doesn&apos;t back a film to the hilt, it ends up going straight to video. I wish I&apos;d got the chance to see this on the big screen.",9,"['Action', 'Crime', 'Drama']","['kidnapping', 'bodyguard', 'kidnapped girl', 'corrupt cop', 'cia agent']",2004-04-23,['Tony Scott'],"['Denzel Washington', 'Christopher Walken', 'Dakota Fanning']","['A.J.

Fire in the Sky,An Arizona logger mysteriously disappears for five days in an alleged encounter with a flying saucer in 1975. His co-workers endure ridicule and contempt as they are wrongly accused of murder.,"How many times have you seen the words, &apos;Based on a true story,&apos; at the beginning of a Hollywood film? Normally, when that&apos;s written, what you see on screen is about as far away to what actually happened as you can possibly get. However, &apos;Fire in the Sky&apos; is almost quite close to what really happened (obviously, if you believe what the story is all about).

Travis Walton was a logging worker in 1975 who, while up in the mountains, was abducted by a flying saucer right before his co-workers&apos; eyes. This is the account of what happened. One criticism is that it heavily favours the account of Walton and his co-workers, over those sceptical of their fantastical claim. However, when you think about it, Fire in the Sky would have been a pretty dull film if all that happened was Travis decided to hide in the woods for a few days while his mates made up crazy stories about what they&apos;ve seen.

This is a great film - kind of like a &apos;real life&apos; episode of the X-files. And, you can enjoy it on two levels: if you&apos;re a &apos;Mulder&apos; and believe in aliens, UFOs etc, you can look at it as a documented account of what actually happened. However, if you&apos;re a &apos;Scully&apos; (i.e. a sceptic) then you should be able to enjoy it by simply seeing it as a good piece of dramatic science-fiction.

Either way, if you&apos;re into sci-fi or drama, you should quite enjoy it. It&apos;s also worth looking into further - the real Travis Walton wrote quite a comprehensive book on the subject matter and there&apos;s plenty of &apos;evidence&apos; to back up his claims if you do some research on the internet.",8,"['Biography', 'Drama', 'Fantasy']","['cult film', 'alien', 'alien abduction', 'alien spacecraft', 'american midwest']",1993-03-12,['Robert Lieberman'],"['D.B.

First Men in the Moon,"When a spaceship lands on the moon, it is hailed as a new accomplishment, before it becomes clear that a Victorian party completed the journey in 1899, leading investigators to that mission&apos;s last survivor.","Five years before the Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin touch down on the moon, this film adaption of the H.G. Wells story First Men in the Moon came to the screen. A moon expedition has finally landed and to the amazement of all a perfectly preserved union jack is found and presumably claiming this large piece of real estate for the United Kingdom.

And a diary with three names in it gives the names of those people who were on this first lunar expedition. One of them is still alive and in a nursing home in Great Britain. It&apos;s Edward Judd, now in his eighties or nineties as you&apos;d have it and he has an amazing adventure to tell.

I use the phrase deliberately because such an amazing adventure is the kind of stuff Stephen Spielberg would find ideal. And if he reads this, maybe he&apos;ll think on it as a future project. But if he does it, it will have to be without the special special effects of Ray Harryhausen who created an enchanting, but very dangerous world on the moon.

Judd&apos;s story is how he and his fiancé Martha Hyer got involved with an eccentric scientist Lionel Jeffries. Jeffries may look eccentric as he usually does in his roles, but he&apos;s developed nothing less than a totally unique form of propulsion and he knows what he wants to do with it. Nothing less than a trip to the moon.

Like Jeanette Macdonald in Maytime or Gloria Stuart in Titanic, Judd from the man&apos;s point of view tells the story of his lost love Hyer and that unique trip to the moon. As to what happens there and what happens to Jeffries, Judd, and Hyer you have to see the film for that.

Since it&apos;s a Ray Harryhausen film you kind of know what to expect and Harryhausen delivers in grand style. 

It almost makes you believe that it was Judd, Jeffries, and Hyer who took that one small step for man first.",7,"['Adventure', 'Sci-Fi']","['giant insect', 'psychotronic film', 'low budget sci fi movie', 'astronomical object in title', 'man on moon']",1964-11-20,['Nathan Juran'],"['Edward Judd', 'Martha Hyer', 'Lionel Jeffries']","['Nigel Kneale', 'Jan Read', 'H.G.

Five Minutes to Live,,"This film is best remembered for the fact that it stars country legend Johnny Cash is his first film role. This actually lowered my expectations for the film, as I&apos;m not a massive fan of Cash and films that go down in history for the casting of a non-actor are often not very good...but this film has far more going for it than it&apos;s lead actor, and overall I&apos;ve got to say that it&apos;s criminal that this hasn&apos;t won itself a more esteemed place in cinema history. It&apos;s clear that the film was shot on a very low budget as it features a very grainy black and white picture, a small central cast and some suspect acting from all corners; but all this stuff doesn&apos;t matter, as the screenplay is well written and there&apos;s a lot of fun to be had with this film. The plot follows a couple of guys who think they&apos;ve discovered the perfect get rich quick scheme. One of them pretends to be a salesman in order to get into the house of the president of the women&apos;s association, while the other one pretends to be a customer at her husband&apos;s bank. After explaining the situation to her husband, they offer him a trade; his money or his wife.

Overall, it has to be said that this little thriller isn&apos;t very original as there have been a lot of films in this same vein; but Bill Karn&apos;s film approaches it&apos;s subject with a fresh view, and the way that the director continually ensures the tone is always bleak provides a major highlight. It&apos;s easy to believe that the central character is in danger through Cash&apos;s loose cannon performance, and the way that the action focuses on two central locations; the family home and the bank, ensures that the plot always takes centre stage, and it is made interesting through its memorable cast of characters. Even though Cash wasn&apos;t predominantly an actor, his performance is really good and the way that the director lets him play his guitar makes best use of him. And on a personal note, I think it&apos;s good of Cash to put himself at risk to play a sadistic maniacal character. The rest of the support cast play second fiddle to the musical genius, but each one gives a good turn and this ensures that the film is elevated above its low budget thriller status. It all boils down to an exciting and satisfying climax that both deals fitting comeuppance, and rounds it all off nicely. Overall, this film is well worth tracking down and comes highly recommended!",7,"['Crime', 'Drama', 'Music']","['bank', 'house', 'bank robbery', 'suburb', 'home invasion']",,['Bill Karn'],"['Johnny Cash', 'Donald Woods', 'Cay Forester']","['Cay Forester', 'Palmer Thompson', 'Robert L.

Flash Gordon,A football player and his friends travel to the planet Mongo and find themselves fighting the tyranny of Ming the Merciless to save Earth.,"Yes, the plot is silly, yes the dialogue is cheesy and yes, some of the special effects are badly done, but nonetheless it is great fun. Like Rocky Horror Picture Show, Congo and Jingle All the Way, Flash Gordon is a sort of guilty pleasure of mine. The costumes are quite extravagant and the sets are exotic. Then you have an irresistibly killer soundtrack from Queen, who also brought us the classics We Will Rock You and Bohemian Rhapsody. The direction is pretty good and the acting is surprisingly great. Sam J Jones is bad with his cheesiness but he was fun besides, thank goodness he wasn&apos;t bland like Justin Whalin from Dungeons and Dungeons, and Melody Anderson is charming and alluring as Dale. Brian Blessed is very hammy as Vultran but he is great fun regardless and Topol, who was so superb in Fiddler on the Roof, is memorable as Dr Hans Zarkov. And while Ornella Muti is a wonderfully witty and sexy Princess Aura, it is Max Von Sydow who walks away with the picture, pantomime of course but sinister as well and I appreciated that.

The Fog,An unearthly fog rolls into a small coastal town exactly 100 years after a ship mysteriously sank in its waters.,"THE FOG 

Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)

Sound format: Mono

While celebrating its centenary birthday, a small Californian coastal town is visited by a ghostly fog containing an army of murderous spirits who take revenge for a terrible injustice.

Released on a wave of expectation following the worldwide success of John Carpenter&apos;s HALLOWEEN (1978), THE FOG surprised everyone by generating only moderate returns at the US box-office, though it&apos;s arguably the better of the two films. Beautifully photographed by Carpenter stalwart Dean Cundey (BACK TO THE FUTURE, JURASSIC PARK, etc.), this unassuming &apos;ghost story&apos; opens on a lonely clifftop at midnight, where crusty old sea dog John Houseman tells an audience of wide-eyed children how their home town was built on the foundations of tragedy. As with HALLOWEEN, the pace is slow but steady, punctuated by a series of well-judged scares, and there&apos;s a relentless accumulation of details which belies the script&apos;s modest ambitions.

Jamie Lee Curtis headlines the movie opposite her real life mother Janet Leigh, though Hal Holbrook takes the acting honors as a frightened priest who realizes the town was founded on deception and murder. As the fog rolls in, the narrative reaches an apocalyptic crescendo, as the film&apos;s principal cast are besieged by zombie-like phantoms inside an antiquated church, in scenes reminiscent of NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (1968). Scary stuff, to be sure, though Carpenter was forced to add new material during post-production in an effort to &apos;beef up&apos; the movie&apos;s horror quotient, including a memorable late-night encounter between a fishing boat and the occupants of a ghostly schooner which looms out of the swirling fog (similar scenes would be added to HALLOWEEN II in 1981 for the same reasons, though under less agreeable circumstances). Production values are solid, and Carpenter cranks up the tension throughout, resulting in a small masterpiece of American Gothic. Highly recommended.",6,"['Horror', 'Thriller']","['fog', 'ghost ship', 'lighthouse', 'navigator', 'sea']",1980-02-08,['John Carpenter'],"['Adrienne Barbeau', 'Jamie Lee Curtis', 'Janet Leigh']","['John Carpenter', 'Debra Hill']"

The Football Factory,"An insight on the gritty life of a bored male, Chelsea football hooligan who lives for violence, sex, drugs & alcohol.","Football Factory does not shamelessly glorify violence like many have said. Violence is obviously a focal part of the movie, but i feel the violence of this movie is shown in a negative light. Through out the movie football hooligans of Chelsea FC are followed in a number of different situations. The turf of other football firms, and the local pubs are where many of the scenes are shot, but despite following the violence of football hooligans, this film is a lot deeper than that. It is about trying to feel a part of something. It is about confused individuals that are looking for something to believe in, and throughout the movie there are internal struggles where the characters battle within their own minds as to what&apos;s more important; growing up, or football hooliganism. The violence in this movie isn&apos;t gratuitous. It is necessary and factual, and is needed to show the internal struggles of the movies&apos; many confused individuals. Not a bad film, although it is a little rough around the edges.",6,"['Crime', 'Drama', 'Sport']","['reference to chelsea f.c.', 'football hooligan', 'hooliganism', 'hooligan', 'drug abuse']",2004-05-14,['Nick Love'],"['Danny Dyer', 'Frank Harper', 'Tamer Hassan']","['John King', 'Nick Love']"
Per qualche dollaro in più,Two bounty hunters with the same intentions team up to track down an escaped Mexican outlaw.,"Exceptional performances by three heavyweight actors, Gian Maria Volonte and Lee Van Cleef - both of whom, it&apos;s a shame, did not have all that many more opportunities to shine in quality films after this one - and Clint Eastwood, along with taut direction, editing, cinematography and gripping and unique music (by the great Ennio Morricone), make this movie a real standout. (The music&apos;s almost a major character in this film, in fact.) Stylistically iconic, this Sergio Leone opus has an endlessly fascinating and spellbinding story that surprises to the end. Plus, we really come to like the co-heroes, Van Cleef and Eastwood - we want to befriend them and emulate them. Volonte was priceless as a demonic villain - his facial expressions rich with narcissism and a strange kind of violence-fueled euphoria no one else has ever matched in film history, for my money. Though he clashed with director Leone and purportedly did not like the Western genre, Volonte&apos;s performance rises above the film&apos;s genre and could be favorably compared to the best portrayed villains of other more mainstream movies. Volonte brought a realism to his character and an intensity you don&apos;t see in many films. But so did Van Cleef, whose work in this film is incredible. You&apos;d have thought other movie makers would have rushed to cast Van Cleef in important roles after this film, but no. Very strange. Though some might question the wanton violence in this film, the truth is that the real wild west was even more violent and the violence often much more capricious and random. Like all great artistic works, this film never grows old for me. I am always drawn to watch it again and again for it is of such a depth and complexity that it only reveals more of itself with each viewing.",9,['Western'],"['mexico', 'spaghetti western', 'wild west', 'bounty hunter', 'violence']",1967-05-10,['Sergio Leone'],"['Clint Eastwood', 'Lee Van Cleef', 'Gian Maria Volontè']","['Sergio Leone', 'Fulvio Morsella', 'Luciano Vincenzoni']"
For Sama,FOR SAMA is both an intimate and epic journey into the female experience of war.,For Sama received a standing ovation at its world premiere at Austin&apos;s SXSW Film Festival. It also received the Grand Jury Prize for Documentary Feature. It is a remarkable film. Each of us tries to go through his/her daily life and pretend there is no place in the world where human beings are being routinely slaughtered as occurred in Aleppo. Waad Al-Khateab is a hero. She and her husband - a doctor - stayed in Aleppo through the worst of the siege. He saved lives and she documented the horrors for the world to see. For Sama presents some of the most unflinching war coverage that I have seen. The beauty of the film is that she presents it as almost a love letter to her infant daughter Sama who was born in Aleppo in the months leading up to the siege. She is trying to tell her story and the story of her city (one of the oldest continuously populated cities on the planet). The contrast between the horror of parents try to care and protect an infant while simultaneously trying to save lives and document the horror is breathtaking and heart-wrenching. It is as if you set a love story amidst the flames of hell. This is a story that needs to be widely viewed and it will be since it has been picked up by PBS and will air on Frontline in the coming months. Everyone who loves children and hates war (and I really hope that is everyone) should see this film.,10,"['Documentary', 'Biography', 'War']","['syria', 'aleppo syria', 'mother daughter relationship', 'year 2016', 'husband wife relationship']",2019-07-26,"['Waad Al-Kateab', 'Edward Watts']","['Waad Al-Kateab', 'Sama Al-Khateab', 'Hamza Al-Khateab']",[]

Footlight Parade,,"The Stock Market Crash of 1929 and the Depression following almost ruined the American Musical Theater, in fact it was the final death blow to vaudeville. Those behind the curtains were hit as bad as those in front.

In an effort to stimulate the show business economy and his own personal economy, out of work theater director James Cagney comes up with a brilliant idea. Stage live relevant prologues to the movies that are being shown at the various movie theaters that are springing up overnight from the old theaters. Some other competitors get wind of it and the competition is on.

Footlight Parade is my favorite Busby Berkeley film. It gives James Cagney a chance to display some of his versatility as a dancer as well as a tough guy. In his retirement Cagney said that while he screened his few and far between musicals a lot, he could barely be bothered with some of his straight dramatic films. He wished he&apos;d done a few more musicals in his career and I wish he had.

Of course the staging of these Busby Berkeley extravaganzas on the stage of a movie palace defies all logic and reason. But it&apos;s so creative and fun to watch. 

Dick Powell gets to sing three songs in Footlight Parade, Ah the Moon is Here, Honeymoon Hotel, and By a Waterfall, the last two with Ruby Keeler further cementing that screen team. Ruby sings and dances with Powell in the last two and she partners with James Cagney in my favorite number from Footlight Parade, Shanghai Lil. 

Joan Blondell is Cagney&apos;s no nonsense girl Friday at the theater. Like in Blonde Crazy, she&apos;s the one with the real brains in that duo and it&apos;s her quick thinking that bails him out of some domestic problems he has on top of his theatrical ones. One of Blondell&apos;s best screen roles.

Look for Dorothy Lamour and Ann Sothern in the chorus as per the IMDb pages for both of them. John Garfield is seen briefly in the Shanghai Lil number. And in a scene at the beginning of the film, producer Guy Kibbee takes Cagney to a movie theater where they are showing a B western starring John Wayne. The Duke&apos;s voice is unmistakable. But what&apos;s even more unusual is that the brief clip shows him in a scene with Frank McHugh who plays another Cagney assistant in Footlight Parade. I think the brothers Warner were playing a little joke there. I&apos;ve got to believe that clip was deliberate.

Footlight Parade is Busby Berkeley at his surreal best.",10,"['Comedy', 'Musical', 'Romance']","['secretary', 'tap dancing', 'dancing on a bar', 'censor', 'rehearsal']",1933-10-21,['Lloyd Bacon'],"['James Cagney', 'Joan Blondell', 'Ruby Keeler']","['Manuel Seff', 'James Seymour', 'Robert Lord']"

Le foto proibite di una signora per bene,"The wife of a struggling businessman is blackmailed by a mysterious man into having a sadistic affair with him, or he will leak evidence implicating her husband of murder.","This is a slightly unusual giallo. In fact, it is debatable whether it is actually a giallo at all, as there is no knife-wielding black-gloved assassin and there are no murders to speak of. Strictly speaking, this is a mystery movie with a giallo feel. The gialloesque elements come in the form of an eye-catching title, stylish camera-work, great interior decor, a Morricone score, a convoluted mystery, sleazy undertones and the usual quota of beautiful looking women and hideous looking men. In other words, its great fun. The cast is very small, including giallo regular Pier Paolo Capponi, but the undoubted stars of the show are the leading ladies. Both Dagmar Lassandar and Susan Scott look very alike, and this is no bad thing as they are both stunning. Susan Scott is particularly effective here, she has a great screen presence and truly shines in this film - it really is hard to take your eyes off her. The Morricone score is pretty varied, from dreamy lounge to cheesy Euro-pop. It isn&apos;t necessarily one of his better soundtracks but it certainly has kitsch value. There is also some incredibly un-PC dialogue and the plot itself is not exactly coming at us from a feminist angle! However, this is to be expected from a 70s giallo movie and its one of the reasons why we love them. They are time-capsules of a different era. I would recommend this film for giallo completists and lovers of obscure Italian movies. Its unusual and camp fun. But if you are expecting an Argentoesque violent thriller you may be best served looking elsewhere.",8,"['Mystery', 'Thriller']","['adultery', 'voyeurism', 'sexual perversion', 'sexual desire', 'sexual attraction']",1971-04-15,['Luciano Ercoli'],"['Dagmar Lassander', 'Pier Paolo Capponi', 'Simón Andreu']","['Ernesto Gastaldi', 'Mahnahén Velasco']"
Forty Guns,"Showdown in Arizona between the Bonnell brothers, U.S.Marshals, and Jessica Drummond, the iron-fist rancher who controls the territory.","Forty Guns is written and directed by Sam Fuller. It stars Barbara Stanwyck, Barry Sullivan, Dean Jagger, John Ericson, Gene Barry, Robert Dix, Eve Brent and Ziva Rodann. Music is by Harry Sukman and cinematography by Joseph F. Biroc.

It&apos;s all going to kick off in Arizona between the Bonnell brothers, U.S.Marshals, and Jessica Drummond - the tough no nonsense lady rancher who controls the territory.

So what do we have here then? Just another recycled Western plot that is basically the Earp&apos;s/Clanton&apos;s feud that culminated in the Gunfight At The O.K. Corral? Well no, not really, for this is Sam Fuller on devilishly twisty form.

Fuller gives this particular Western a film noir make over, both in look and dialogue innuendo. Pic is filled with outstanding sequences, be it shocking deaths, bravado pumped show downs or chiaroscuro framing of key characters, no frame is wasted in this piece - visually or aurally.

From a psychological stand point it&apos;s a right hornets nest, a meaty broth of cynical observations on love, power and that bastion of American cinema - the Western. The action construction on offer is electrifying, if Fuller isn&apos;t dallying with various camera techniques to keep the story on the hop, he&apos;s being kinetic with his action filming. All of which is in the Scope format, with the ace Biroc weaving some monochrome magic.

Probably now it has risen above being just a cult Western classic, Fuller&apos;s standing in the decades that would follow this release have ensured that to be the case. Yet it is noted that this holds no surprises in how story eventually pans out, which is disappointing given the noir pulse beats driving it forward. In fact a charge of schmaltz at pics end is justified and stops this being the masterpiece many of us yearn it to be.

Still, tis a superb genre piece of some considerable substance. A film that begs to be revisited on more than one occasion.

The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse,"In Argentina, one daughter of patriarch Madariaga is married to a Frenchman while the other is married to a German thus leading to a crisis when Nazi Germany occupies France and some Madariaga family members fight on opposite sides.","Vincente Minnelli&apos;s updating of Vicente Blasco Ibanez&apos;s novel is an absorbing melodrama which, as another viewer has noted, must have been watched by Visconti before he made his film The Damned a few years later.

The film begins with the Desnoyers family gathering for dinner following the return of Heinrich (Karl Boehm) from a spell in Germany where, to the disgust of grandfather Julio, he has been indoctrinated into the ideology of the Nazi party. The grandfather is played by Lee J. Cobb and it&apos;s a blessing that the old boy pegs it during dinner because Cobb not only chews the scenery but the sets and props as well. Despite this, the lines are clearly drawn between the two sides of the family: Heinrich and his father Karl (Paul Lukas) on one side, Julio No&apos; 2 (Glenn Ford) and little sister Chi Chi (Yvette Mimieux) on the other.

Julio is a playboy with no interest in the war; he prowls swish parties for available women, sidling between arguments of the impending war as he closes in on his prey. Sadly, Ford, usually a likable enough leading man, doesn&apos;t possess the necessary predatory swagger to pull of the role. In fact, he is so badly miscast that he seems to be adrift throughout the film, as if trying to figure out how he was ever chosen for the role (Minnelli wanted Alain Delon, apparently, and we can only imagine what an altogether different interpretation he would have given to the part).

The predicament in which the Desnoyer family find themselves is wholly absorbing as the war slowly tears its members apart. Most imaginable sea-changes in personal opinions are explored during the course of the story, from the discovery of a hidden integrity on Julio&apos;s part, to disillusion on the part of Karl, the WW1 veteran who allows himself to be swept up in the triumphalism of the Nazi&apos;s rise only to find his son becoming irrevocably morally corrupted by the same experiences.

The movie never won any awards, which is probably how it should be, but it provides an intelligent and literary exploration of a fascinating subject that makes it easy to watch despite its bloated running time.",,"['Drama', 'War']","['adolf hitler character', 'gestapo', 'argentina', 'french resistance', 'self sacrifice']",1962-07-12,['Vincente Minnelli'],"['Glenn Ford', 'Ingrid Thulin', 'Charles Boyer']","['Robert Ardrey', 'John Gay', 'Vicente Blasco Ibáñez']"
Foxy Brown,A voluptuous black vigilante takes a job as a high-class prostitute to get revenge on the mobsters who murdered her boyfriend.,"This was one of the most violent, nonhorror films that I can recall from the 1970s. Beyond the blaxploitation label, Foxy Brown is a solid adventure film, that remains timely to this day. Kudos to Jack Hill, who worked up another treasure with the lovely Ms. Grier. Peter Brown and Kathryn Loder truly deliver unforgettable performances as depraved, sadistic villains, who love each other, but care little for anyone else. The love their characters share is a contrast to the evil that Mr. Elias and Ms. Wall do. As a note, I try to keep things in perspective, and stick to reviewing each film that I write about. But to whoever chooses to read this particular comment, please keep something in mind about the blaxploitation films:

 1. They are action films, for the most part, beyond race. 2. These movies were made to play up the social issues of the time, and even today; so yes, most of the villains were white--deal with it!! 3. Because the blaxploitation films were produced in Hollywood, you should take note that the strong, physical prowess exhibited by the heroes and heroines of the films eventually find their way into the mainstream, as the Die Hard, Lethal Weapon, Commando, and Cobra movies of the 1980s and 1990s utilize the same, over-the-top action in urban settings. These films, with white leads, are more inline with the blaxploitation formula, than Dirty Harry and Death Wish pics; the Eastwood and Bronson characters mainly used their guns, and rarely duked it out with any villains.

So maybe I am rambling, but my point is this: enjoy each film for what it&apos;s worth. And keep in mind, the target audience for blaxploitation movies was ignored by studios during the decades before the 1970s. If you are white, and like blaxploitation, or of any race and think of these movies as cliched slices of the 1970s, please open your minds and keep a proper perspective of the times.",8,"['Action', 'Crime', 'Thriller']","['revenge', 'blaxploitation', 'black hero', 'cult film', 'b movie']",1974-04-05,['Jack Hill'],"['Pam Grier', 'Antonio Fargas', 'Peter Brown']","['Jack Hill', 'David Sheldon']"

Freaks,"A circus&apos; beautiful trapeze artist agrees to marry the leader of side-show performers, but his deformed friends discover she is only marrying him for his inheritance.","The subject of human disability is still a taboo subject in Cinema, even over 70 years since this film&apos;s release.

It&apos;s difficult to imagine what impact this film would have had in the 1930&apos;s, but as it still has the ability to shock ( through the images of bodily deformity ) I can understand why many shunned and disowned this work, and why it totally ruined Todd Browning&apos;s film career.

The basic premise - that beauty is more than skin deep - can appear to be wielded with a sledgehammer, but perhaps the contemporary audience needed to be hit harder in order to make them understand the point.

The film is short ( due to enforced cuts ), and at times can move rather slowly and can appear rather &apos;stagey&apos; which is a trait of many films from the 20&apos;s / 30&apos;s.

But don&apos;t let that put you off. The plot is simple, but it&apos;s the telling of the story rather than the story itself that is important. And you really do need to remind yourself that these are real people - not actors - and this was the live they led.

French Quarter,Chronicles the life of a young New Orleans prostitute and her co-workers.,"This is one of those hard-to-find drive in movies of the 70s which is worth seeking out. The basic story concerns a young woman (Fontaine) who comes to the French Quarter, badly in need of work and ends up dreaming that she is back in another century, or is she in fact an 19th century woman dreaming that she is in the future? The other characters around Fontaine are played by the same actors from the contemporary story. The sets, costumes and ambiance are incredibly detailed (it was shot on location). It features a lot of sex and nudity but at the same time, there is far more plot than usual. In fact, it may take more than one viewing to fully notice, understand and appreciate the nuances. It must have surprised drive-in audiences of the 70s who were probably expecting something far more basic. The actors are reasonably good and the dual storyline is well handled. Some of the scenes may have bordered on an X-rating back when it first came out. Star Bruce Davison did quite well for himself and is still active in Hollywood but most of the rest of the cast did little else after this film. It occasionally shows on late night cable and is worth the wait. An added plus is the jazz score as well as the very offbeat narration.",,"['Drama', 'Fantasy', 'Musical']","['riding a bus', 'whipping scar on back', 'wading in a fountain', 'want ads', 'job hunting']",1979-03-01,['Dennis Kane'],"['Virginia Mayo', 'Bruce Davison', 'Alisha Fontaine']","['Barney Cohen', 'Dennis Kane']"
Frenzy,"A serial murderer is strangling women with a necktie. The London police have a suspect, but he is the wrong man.","After the poorly received Torn Curtain and Topaz, Hitchcock returned home to both the murder genre and to Covent Gardens in London to film Frenzy, a lurid tale of a serial killer and the man caught up as the prime suspect. The only feeling of new from the film comes from the use of nudity and a particular focus on the real killer, and yet it&apos;s still a solidly built thriller, the sort of thing that Hitchcock could seemingly do in his sleep.

There&apos;s a killer on the loose in London, and he has a trademark in that he rapes his female victims and then strangles them with a necktie. In the city is Dick, a former RAF pilot who&apos;s had a hard time of it since he left the service, going from job to job and recently divorced. He starts the movie by taking a drink from the pub where he works and immediately getting fired despite his protestations, and the support of his girlfriend Babs, that he was going to pay for it. Without a job, Dick goes to his ex-wife for some kind of support, which he gets through dinner and twenty pounds that she slips into his pocket without his knowledge.

Later, Dick&apos;s friend Rusk shows up to Dick&apos;s wife&apos;s office, a matchmaking service, and demonstrates for the audience, in rather shocking detail, how he is the necktie killer. Now, the reveal of the identity of the serial killer is an interesting twist on the genre. We see Dick and Rusk interacting at several points, events that tell the audience of the danger Dick is putting himself into while he doesn&apos;t realize it himself. It&apos;s a new version of the tried and true method of creating tension. The other interesting thing about the early reveal is that about half of the movie is from Rusk&apos;s own perspective, including the movie&apos;s best single sequence.

Rusk has murdered another girl and shoved her body into a potato sack onto a truck. As he returns to his apartment, he realizes that he&apos;s lost his pin and that the girl had grabbed onto it. He needs to get back to the body and retrieve the pin, but as he&apos;s hiding in the back of the truck, the driver comes and drives off. Rusk has to negotiate the logistics of hiding in the back of a potato truck while digging out a corpse, breaking the fingers on the right hand because of rigor mortis, retrieving the pin, and then getting out again. I can imagine Hitchcock laughing himself silly as he conceived of the scene (not shooting, it seemed like a nightmare to shoot). It&apos;s such a twist on the sort of sequence where the bad guy, who&apos;s already done the bad dead, is trying to get out of trouble, and the filmmaking is so effective that the audience is along with him, not really cheering him on, but instinctively sharing the same concerns as him.

Another wonderfully amusing aspect of the film, which feels a little disassociated from the rest and gives some pause in terms of praise, is the chief inspector on the case and his wife. The film uses two dinners as springboards for the inspector to explain the police&apos;s position at two different points in the film, and instead of just straight exposition the scenes are played out as the wife brings out the most bizarre dishes that look completely inedible. However, since the police inspector is such a polite British man of good manners, he finds ways to get around eating the food he obviously has great distaste for, one of which made my wife cringe audibly as he did it. They&apos;re two of the most purely entertaining scenes of exposition in Hitchcock&apos;s filmography.

So, yeah, I like it. I do feel like it&apos;s a return to form after Topaz, though I seem to like Torn Curtain more than most so it&apos;s not like some sort of great gap of quality. One of the drawbacks of the film&apos;s approach to treating the two characters, the criminal and the falsely accused, with equal measure is that they end up a bit thinner than they otherwise could be. Dick, in particular, feels like a generic Hitchcock protagonist rather than a strongly written character, especially after the first act when the focus on the actual crimes gets taken up.

It&apos;s a gripping little murder thriller set in Alfred Hitchcock&apos;s old stomping grounds with some wonderful sequences. It seems to have been a bit overpraised contemporaneously, but that doesn&apos;t detract from the fact that it&apos;s still a solidly good film.",7,['Thriller'],"['serial killer', 'rape', 'strangulation', 'murder of a nude woman', 'on the run']",1972-06-21,['Alfred Hitchcock'],"['Jon Finch', 'Barry Foster', 'Barbara Leigh-Hunt']","['Arthur La Bern', 'Anthony Shaffer']"

Friday the 13th: A New Beginning,"Still haunted by his past, Tommy Jarvis, who, as a child, killed Jason Voorhees, is sent to a secluded halfway house in the countryside, where the killing of a young man triggers a brutal series of murders in the area.","&apos;Friday the 13th&apos; may have been panned by critics when first released but since then it is one of the most famous and influential horror films, the franchise containing one of horror&apos;s most iconic villains. The film is popular enough to become a franchise and spawn several sequels of varying quality and generally inferior to the one that started it all of. 

The fifth film in the series &apos;A New Beginning&apos; is the most maligned &apos;Friday the 13th&apos; film by critics and fans, although it has garnered a cult following and its fair share of defence over time. To me, &apos;A New Beginning&apos; is better than its reputation and that it tries to do something different is laudable. Also do not think it&apos;s the worst &apos;Friday the 13th&apos; film. Having said that, the disappointment is understandable. There are good merits here, but it also did fall short to me. 

Starting with &apos;A New Beginning&apos;s&apos; strengths, the best things about it are the as ever haunting music score and the terrific performance, both disturbing and moving, of John Shepherd. There are a few darkly funny moments, a few creepy ones and some of the death scenes are creative. 

The nightmare sequences are stylish and as nightmarish as one would hope. It&apos;s a pretty decent looking film, not cinematic art (but in all honesty that can never be expected from a &apos;Friday the 13th&apos; film) but not amateurish.

However, there are things that work against &apos;A New Beginning&apos;. From my understanding, It is not that the film is different in the lack of Jason (this didn&apos;t bother me at all and is an insignificant issue), the more tongue-in-cheek tone and the idea it tried to introduce that irked fans, but the generally misguided way it was executed. 

More problematic are the problems as a standalone. The acting is not good (Shepherd is the sole exception), Melanie Kinnaman being awful, and the clumsy and far too simple dialogue, that slips more into vulgar camp than darkly tongue-and-cheek, and the mostly annoying and dull stereotypes passing for characters fare worse (the only one to be interesting and get proper development is Tommy). 

&apos;A New Beginning&apos; has the highest body count, and while there are some creative and unsettling deaths (others less so, hurt by gratuity and predictability) it was almost as if there were too many death scenes that gives one not that much time to compose themselves after each one. There is not enough suspense, the creepiness is too far and between and the story is thin and very hackneyed, with one of the series&apos; silliest endings. The mystery elements don&apos;t work, being far too obvious, and neither does the identity of the killer, the killings committed by somebody that is not in it much in their real guise and doesn&apos;t have much presence.

In summation, not that bad and not deserving of its black sheep reputation but a long way from being great. 5/10 Bethany Cox",5,"['Horror', 'Mystery', 'Thriller']","['jason voorhees character', 'sadistic killer', 'child in jeopardy', 'grindhouse film', 'murdered with a machete']",1985-03-22,['Danny Steinmann'],"['Melanie Kinnaman', 'John Shepherd', 'Anthony Barrile']","['Martin Kitrosser', 'David Cohen', 'Danny Steinmann']"

Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan,"Jason Voorhees is accidentally awakened from his watery grave, and he ends up stalking a ship full of graduating high school students headed to Manhattan, NY.","What&apos;s up with all these high schools in the movies having these insane senior trips? The kids in Final Destination flew to Europe, and these kids go on a freaking cruise? I went to Magic Mountain for my senior trip! Oh, well, I guess the payback is that in the movies they all get killed. Magic Mountain sounds a lot better in that sense. By this point in the lengthy Friday the 13th saga, it&apos;s clear that even the writers of these movies (generally the last people to catch on when they come up with idiotic ideas) have noticed that a lot of teenagers going up to Camp Crystal Lake to be rebellious and get slashed all up is getting a little bit old, so in this installment they decided it would be a good idea to have the movie take place on a whole ship full of high school students. 

Moving someone like Jason Voorhees from his home on Camp Crystal Lake to an unfamiliar setting is actually a really good idea for generating more interest in the series, because although it&apos;s a given in a series like this, I think audiences always like to see familiar characters come back from other stories. So while you already know Jason is going to be in the movie because it&apos;s a Friday the 13th, you at least see him in an unfamiliar atmosphere, which removes a lot of the automatic cynicism that is now being generated toward the teenagers who are still stupid enough to go out to the lake. Now we see Jason killing all kinds of kids unsuspectingly on their school trip and then more people on the streets of New York. Amazing the things we find entertaining these days, isn&apos;t it?

There are a lot of fairly innovative deaths aboard the ship in the first half of the film, such as a guy relaxing in the sauna getting one of the hot rocks shoved through his stomach, a guy getting impaled on the communication antenna on the boat, and throat slit by a machete, an amazingly botched scene. You would think that since it was so obvious the knife didn&apos;t even touch that poor guy, they would at least not have done it in such a close-up.

Ironically enough, the part that I was anticipating to be the most interesting was the least creatively done. After realizing what is going on on the boat (meaning, after just about all of them had been killed), the surviving students on board get the life raft and escape, rowing out into the dark ocean in hopes of hitting land. Eventually, they see the New York City skyline and jump for joy. I was anticipating a creative and fun romp through the streets of New York, maybe with Jason confused at his surroundings and therefore going even more nuts, which would create havoc among the population. I mean, LOOK at the guy. He spent the time between the last movie and this one rotting on the bottom of the lake, and he certainly looks like it through this entire movie.

Unfortunately, the filmmakers not only revealed the modesty of their budget through the lack of anything really interesting happening, they also displayed a massive lack of understanding of the geography of the city of New York. I&apos;ve never even been there myself, but it seems like pretty much basic logic that they would not design the city so that the dirtiest slums had the finest waterfront property. Meaning, I doubt you could row up to New York from the ocean, right alongside the Statue of Liberty, and climb up onto land, finding yourself surrounded by endless alleyways full of things like gun-toting rapists and standing barrels of toxic waste. New York is a big city, and all cities throughout the world pretty much have to have things like this somewhere, but generally not right on the water and right next to major monuments. I happen to know, for example, that if you go to San Francisco, you won&apos;t find the crime-ridden slums right under the Golden Gate Bridge, and I doubt that you would find open barrels of toxic waste ANYWHERE.

But anyway, they certainly find some room for effective comic relief (although notably less than other films in the series), my favorite example of which is the scene where Jason looks curiously at a picture of a hockey player on a billboard wearing exactly the same mask that he has on, a sort of self-realization that has since been overshadowed by the T-1000 pausing to look at a metallic mannequin in Terminator 2. I love that stuff, it gives even the most two-dimensional bad guys a sort of self-consciousness, so that they&apos;re not just mindless killing machines but have some semblance of actual thought in their heads, seeing and analyzing their surroundings and pausing when they see something that they don&apos;t understand. Makes the inhuman killers more human, you know?

Speaking of which, there was also a scene that was really funny for much the same reason, and feel free to make fun of me for seeing it this way. There&apos;s a scene pretty near the end of the film where Jason is pursuing the few remaining kids through the streets of Manhattan, and he passes by some street punks hanging out and smoking on the sidewalk and listening to some ridiculous 80s music (&apos;Livin&apos; inna city ain&apos;t no big deal, livin&apos; inna city ain&apos;t no big deal. If the drugs don&apos;t getcha then the hooka&apos;s will.&apos; And so forth), and as Jason walks by, he kicks their boom-box across the sidewalk. Being tough gutterpunks, of course, they stand up and pull out their switchblades, informing Jason that he just dug his own grave. Jason&apos;s response is to turn and face them and lift up his mask so they can see his face. I liked that scene, because like the one above, it shows a self-consciousness. Jason KNOWS that he looks terrifying. He always has, and rotting on the bottom of the lake made it even worse. It also shows that he can deal with people in a way other than cutting them all up and still have it be pretty satisfying to the audience. 

The climax of the film is bogged down pretty badly by some heavily botched logic and another massive lack of understanding of the underbelly operations of a major city. First of all, none of the passersby up on the streets take a second look at this gigantic, wet, rotting man walking down the street with a hockey mask. I know New Yorkers can be cold and indifferent, but even THEY would not take something like THAT as normal. But even worse, as the kids escape into the underground sewage system (which does not run through wide walkways beneath the sidewalks in ANY city that doesn&apos;t want to smell like it&apos;s own waste), they run into a sewage worker who informs them that the sewers (in which they are currently standing) fill with toxic waste every night at midnight (&apos;Exactly ten minutes from now!&apos;), and is then killed by Jason before being able to show them how to get out.

I won&apos;t get into the fact that there is no imaginable reason for any underground pipe system to fill with toxic waste every night at a certain time other than to create false suspense for a movie like this, although that is most of the reason that this climax falls so completely flat. We do get something for the kids to run away from and a time-limit for them to get out of the sewer, and we do get a glimpse of Jason&apos;s hideous face as he melts into the waste, but it is a completely contrived setting that has no basis in reality, which is the one thing that always makes horror films (or films of almost any genre, for that matter) more effective. Friday the 13th VIII, obviously, is not very concerned with that, which makes it one of the less interesting installments in the saga, although at least it takes place in a different setting so we have a reason to slap our foreheads other than because there is yet ANOTHER group of morons going up to Camp Crystal Lake to taunt the legend of Jason Voorhees.",3,"['Adventure', 'Horror', 'Thriller']","['friday the thirteenth', 'boat', 'hockey mask', 'anchor', 'manhattan new york city']",1989-07-28,['Rob Hedden'],"['Jensen Daggett', 'Kane Hodder', 'Todd Caldecott']","['Rob Hedden', 'Victor Miller']"
From Beyond,"A group of scientists have developed the Resonator, a machine which allows whoever is within range to see beyond normal perceptible reality. But when the experiment succeeds, they are immediately attacked by terrible life forms.","From the team that brought us the horror classic; Re-Animator comes From Beyond; a tale of a mad scientist and his search for the ultimate pleasure.

Like Re-Animator, From Beyond is based on a story by the fantastic horror writer H.P. Lovecraft. The acting here comes courtesy of two of Re-Animator&apos;s best actors; Jeffrey Combs, a man that is well known in the world of B-Movie, and Barbara Crampton; the scream queen that we all remember from the infamous &apos;head&apos; sequence in Re-Animator. There is also a role in this movie for Ken Foree, whom horror fans will instantly recognize from the classic film, Dawn of the Dead. I didn&apos;t know he was in this movie, so it was a nice surprise for me. From Beyond is also brought to the screen by the same team that brought Re-Animator to the screen; Stuart Gordon in the director&apos;s chair and Brian Yuzna producing. With a group of people as accomplished in the horror genre as this fine bunch, what could possibly go wrong?

The plot of this movie is good because it very much plunges into the unknown, and as well all know; it is that which makes horror frightening. This movie is also made good by the fact that once the horror starts, it doesn&apos;t stop and that&apos;s always a good thing for a horror movie as nobody likes waiting for the next horror sequence to turn up. The team of Gordon and Yuzna obviously knows that relentlessness makes a good horror movie as it is evident in all horror movies that they have worked on, together or separately. The idea behind it is also an original one, as ever with H.P. Lovecraft and it leaves a lot open for creativity, which is capitalized upon very well by Stuart Gordon with his interesting and effective creatures that are brought into the film as a result of the scientist&apos;s foray into &apos;the beyond&apos;. The story, it could be said, is unrealistic, which is true of most horror films. However, the way it is brought to life seems realistic and as there is some explanation to the point of the machine and that which it does, so the audience can somewhat believe it; much to the film&apos;s credit.

In the 80&apos;s, horror reached a new point; gone was the creativity of the 60&apos;s and 70&apos;s, and a new area of over the top and extremely gory horror was opened up. From Beyond very much capitalizes on this &apos;new wave&apos;, but unlike a lot of the 80&apos;s films that did, From Beyond manages to pull it off so it is both interesting and creative and therefore it is a cut above the majority of other 80&apos;s films of the same ilk. From Beyond is not a masterpiece, but it is very good and fans of the horror genre will certainly find something to like about it.

From Hell,"In Victorian-era London, a troubled clairvoyant police detective investigates the murders of Jack the Ripper.","There are many things in media that have nearly insurmountable preconceptions that lead to generic truisms. One of these is &apos;comic books are pure fluff,&apos; and another is &apos;no good movie is ever based on a comic book&apos;. 

From Hell is a project that takes both of those truisms and tosses them completely out the window. Based on an ambitious graphic novel written by Alan Moore and illustrated by Eddie Campbell, From Hell (named for the signature on the Jack the Ripper letters written to the police), is one man&apos;s carefully researched theory into the eternal mystery surrounding the Whitechapel murders of 1888. 

This is not a factual display of guilt or innocence, as many of the answers behind these crimes will never be known, but as theory mixed with fact, it creates with chilling detail the mood of lower-class London in the late nineteenth century, where life was cheap, bloody and oftentimes short.

The Hughes brothers, noted for their stylish direction, do a very good job of creating the mood here, involving all the grunginess and hopelessness of the streets, and combining the more mystical elements of Moore&apos;s story into the crime tale. Johnny Depp is Inspector Abberline - an opium-smoking criminal investigator that often follows up on hunches he receives during moments of hallucinatory revelation.

The style of the film - dripping with violent murder of prostitutes in alleyways - leaves more to the imagination than it reveals, although the gore level is by no means light. The vicious throat-slashes and bloody crime scenes are definitely grotesque, but most of the time we are shown the crime after the fact, letting the viewer decide how horrible the murder itself was. 

All the performances are strong, fitting together into an ensemble piece, with Depp being as much a chameleon as ever as Abberline, and Robbie Coltrane equally strong as his colleague Godfrey. Ian Holm, Heather Graham, and Ian Richardson also provide good supporting roles. 

 For an historical perspective of the Jack the Ripper crimes, best to watch an A&E documentary. But for a theoretical description of the crimes, and an artful depiction of a carefully constructed tale, definitely check out the very chilling, very calculated, and very good From Hell.",9,"['Horror', 'Mystery', 'Thriller']","['jack the ripper', 'conspiracy theorist', 'surprise ending', '19th century', '1880s']",2001-10-19,"['Albert Hughes', 'Allen Hughes']","['Johnny Depp', 'Heather Graham', 'Ian Holm']","['Alan Moore', 'Eddie Campbell', 'Terry Hayes']"
From Russia with Love,James Bond willingly falls into an assassination plot involving a naive Russian beauty in order to retrieve a Soviet encryption device that was stolen by S.P.E.C.T.R.E.,"&apos;From Russia With Love&apos; is the second and last of the Bond films to be made without a rigid formula.

So, like &apos;Dr. No&apos;, there&apos;s only a single sex interest (let&apos;s not use the term &apos;love&apos; too lightly), rather than the good-girl-survives, bad/tragic-girl-dies dichotomy that would later structure all the films (bar OHMSS and, interestingly, the Dalton films), and unlike &apos;Dr. No&apos;, the villainous plot is rather small beer and resolutely real-world - to steal a code machine and humiliate the British Intelligence community in the process. There&apos;s also no bombastic theme song, although Matt Monro provides an easy-listening version of the theme tune at the end (it&apos;s not half bad, actually, although Shirley Bassey&apos;s brassy &apos;Goldfinger&apos; makes it seem antediluvian in comparison).

Effectively, this means that it&apos;s the last Bond film in which the makers were trying to make a film, not a Bond film. It didn&apos;t matter if the motifs were all there or not, it only mattered if it was a good film. Unsurprisingly, it has a good claim to being the best film of the series, and it&apos;s certainly the least self-conscious (compare with &apos;Thunderball&apos;, an artificial attempt to replicate &apos;Goldfinger&apos; but making everything bigger).

So, Daniela Bianchi isn&apos;t really just the latest &apos;Bond Girl&apos;, but the character at the heart of this thriller - she pretty much is the story. Ursula Andress might have had an iconic entrance in &apos;Dr. No&apos;, but she was so much window-dressing, irrelevant to the plot, arriving late and with almost no agency in the events that unfold around her. By contrast, the crucial pivot of &apos;From Russia With Love&apos; is whether Bianchi&apos;s Tanya will side with Bond or SMERSH - the age old &apos;love or duty&apos; dilemma.

The film also takes time with detours that have little to do with the main plot - as in the sequence at the gypsy camp. There is a real feeling of a functioning world around Bond&apos;s escapades, rather than just colourful &apos;exotic&apos; backdrops.

There also isn&apos;t an undue emphasis on big action set pieces - Bond&apos;s encounter with a helicopter (very &apos;North by Northwest&apos; - in fact Hitchcock&apos;s influence is detectable throughout this film, from the Cathedral sequence, to the cool Blondeness of Bianchi, to the train setting of the second half) and the climactic speedboat chase are well-executed, but miniature next to those of later films. Tellingly, the best remembered action sequence is the fight between Connery and Robert Shaw on the train, and the series would never better this intimate, brutal struggle.

Shaw is by far the best of the series&apos; bull-necked heavies - he&apos;s intelligent and charismatic as well as forceful, almost a Bond-equivalent. Lotte Lenya and Pedro Armendariz are both excellent in their supporting turns, reminders of a time when the series actually featured fully developed supporting characters, and Bianchi is good - she may lack the overt sex appeal of Andress, but she&apos;s a better actress, playing innocent without being either stupid or dull. Connery really grows into the role here, a long way from the pork-pie hatted clod he was in the first film but still untamed and prickly enough to be an exciting screen presence. It was a long slow decline from here to the tubby jobsworth of &apos;Diamonds Are Forever&apos;.

The early Bond films often escape the critical gaze, and when they are subjected to it, it is usually through rose-tinted spectacles. &apos;Dr. No&apos; is dull and poorly acted, &apos;Goldfinger&apos; fun but rather shapeless, and &apos;Thunderball&apos; just tries too hard altogether. &apos;From Russia With Love&apos; is a polished little gem, a cold-war thriller done with great style, and a minor masterpiece, irrespective of the series around it.",8,"['Action', 'Adventure', 'Thriller']","['british secret service', 'blofeld&apos;s cat', 'bond girl', 'official bond film', 'james bond character']",1964-05-27,['Terence Young'],"['Sean Connery', 'Robert Shaw', 'Lotte Lenya']","['Richard Maibaum', 'Johanna Harwood', 'Ian Fleming']"

Frosty the Snowman,An animated musical number of the beloved classic song based off everyone&apos;s favorite snowman Frosty.,"I recently discovered on Mark Evanier&apos;s site as linked from Cartoon Brew a couple of UPA animated holiday shorts that are on YouTube. One was Peter Cottontail which for some reason is not listed on IMDb. That one played the whole song and depicted visually the entire premise down to the hunter that shot the rabbit&apos;s tail. This one, Frosty the Snowman, features the title character&apos;s fun with some kids before he leaves so he won&apos;t melt away. Both had a chorus that featured no musical accompaniment, just them singing in the standard jazzy style of the period. These were longtime annual staples on Chicago kid shows for years.

The Frozen Ground,An Alaska State Trooper partners with a young woman who escaped the clutches of serial killer Robert Hansen to bring the murderer to justice. Based on actual events.,"The Frozen Ground tells the chilling story of a aerial killer in Alaska, who targeted young women, but let one slip.

It&apos;s an incredibly dark, sombre film, with an intensely bleak tone from start to finish. It&apos;s pretty good, it lacks some of the subtleties that you may have hoped would be here, however it&apos;s there to tell a story, and it gets the job done.

Not often can I stick with a film starring Nicholas Cage, I&apos;m not really a fan of his, or the roles that be tends to take, but credit where it&apos;s due, he&apos;s pretty good here, it&apos;s a subtle performance, he&apos;s better than most of the other cast.

Very gritty, it needed a few lighter moments to have made it work better.

The Funhouse,"Four teenagers visit a local carnival for a night of innocent amusement, but soon discover that nothing there is innocent or amusing.","Four hormone-driven teens sneak into a funhouse at a traveling carnival, and plan to stay the night. Little do they know, it harbours a deformed sex-crazed maniac. Now, they&apos;ve seen too much, and must find a way out, before the monster and his father find them...to dole out their own brand of carny justice. 

The way the whole sub-plot with the little brother plays out is really weak. It&apos;s only included to offer a possible out that never comes to fruition...and it plays out as awkwardly as does that last molestey scene with the little kid in it.

Petty criticisms aside, however, it&apos;s an entertaining film. The funhouse robots are pretty rad, and the monster is badass. The kills could have been a little more gory...but the one where they accidentally axe their friend is great! There&apos;s a nice amount of tension in that final scene too.

While not a masterpiece of horror or anything, this Tobe Hooper film is certainly worth a watch. But it&apos;s not particularly scary.

Fuzz,Police in Boston search for a mad bomber trying to extort money from the city.,"Based on the same characters as the early 60s TV series 87th PRECINCT that starred Robert Lansing, Norman Fell, Gena Rowlands and others. The TV series was based in New York City but here the 87th Precinct is in Boston (though no one has a Boston accent).

Burt Reynolds stars in this ensemble comedy/drama about a mad bomber trying to extort money from a wealthy man. It&apos;s an uneasy mix of comedy and drama especially when people start getting blown up. The cops also come off as a bunch of really stupid oafs without any common sense at all.

Reynolds plays the same character Lansing played on TV. Raquel Welch shows up as a cop and is totally miscast and unbelievable, though to be fair, it&apos;s a badly written role. Other cops include Jack Weston, Tom Skerritt, James McEachin, Steve Ihnat, Dan Frazer, and others. Gino Conforti and Gerald Hiken plays i for laughs as a copy of wisecracking painters assigned to re-do the squad room. And Neile Adams shows up for one scene as Reynolds&apos; deaf wife (the Rowlands part on TV).

The bad guys are headed by Yul Brynner as a hearing-impaired maniac and Don Gordon and Peter Bonerz as his main stooges. There&apos;s also a couple of kids played by Charles Martin Smith and Gary Morgan who run around torching drunks (a real barrel of laughs).

Galaxy Quest,"The alumni cast of a space opera television series have to play their roles as the real thing when an alien race needs their help. However, they also have to defend both Earth and the alien race from a reptilian warlord.","A long time ago, I read a very entertaining & humorous short story in a book collection of Star Trek stories by fan authors, a whimsical piece about how several of the real Trek actors, such as Shatner & Nimoy, get zapped into the Trek universe, as if it was real, and are forced to enact their TV roles in a real setting. This movie captures that whimsy and is very entertaining, as a result. It begins rather mundanely - on purpose - during a standard science fiction convention, in which several actors, whose careers nosedived after starring in a canceled sci-fi TV show, are relegated to these cheesy appearances, signing autographs and hiding their disgust at what they&apos;ve been reduced to. Well, except Tim Allen, who starts off very cheery until he has some ice water thrown in his face, a surprisingly effective moment. All the actors playing the actors fill out their roles very well. Tim Allen used to be the Capt.Kirk-type commander on the TV show; Weaver played his communications officer, like Uhura, and always repeated computer statements; Rickman was the alien doctor; Shalhoub was the Scotty-like tech man below decks; Mitchell was the pilot, like Sulu. Rockwell ends up along for the ride, even though he only appeared in one episode, as an expendable crewman.

When everything shifts, about 20 minutes in, it&apos;s not very subtle. All of a sudden, these has-been actors are thrust into a very real galactic adventure. It&apos;s kind of a jaw-dropping scene, meant to inspire awe, and, at the same time, the humor is quite clever and thought out. The actors&apos; reactions when they&apos;re first transported over several light years are priceless. And, even in already good moments like these, the filmmakers throw in an extra little slice of comedy, as one of the actors does not react as expected. Rickman stands out a bit as the huffy British actor, showing exasperation in almost every scene he&apos;s in, but it&apos;s never tiresome. Weaver & Allen exceed expectations, however; we&apos;re not used to seeing them in roles such as this. Allen is known for comedy, but here he&apos;s expected to draw out a character with a long history as a pretentious, sometimes failed actor, and he succeeds nicely. Rockwell nails the role of the nervous 3rd-stringer, a throwaway part usually, which he somehow manages to use to steal a scene or two. And Shalhoub, who we&apos;re used to being interesting by now, is very much so as the somewhat oddly serene member of the group. But the biggest surprises are Mitchell & Colantoni, whom I was unfamiliar with; Mitchell is terrifically funny attempting to navigate the real starship, while Colantoni offers the most unique interpretation of how a real alien would act & speak.

There was obvious tinkering just before release of this movie to avoid a harsher rating or reduce the length, but these changes could not remove the charm of this sci-fi parody. And, simply labeling it parody may not do it justice. I think only those Trekkers who regard Star Trek as their personal religion may be offended by it; otherwise, any Trek fan should applaud this as mostly a tribute to such entertaining TV shows, recognizing all the little reminders of what made them such great shows. The theme of tolerance, for example, is represented by the strangely different but similar-to-us aliens who the audience cannot help but grow very fond of by the end of the story. On top of that, the so-called sci-fi geek fans, usually the object of scorn, are made the heroes by the end of the film. Everyone has their value in such a universe.",8,"['Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Sci-Fi']","['parody', 'sexy woman', 'alien', 'actor', 'fanboy']",1999-12-25,['Dean Parisot'],"['Tim Allen', 'Sigourney Weaver', 'Alan Rickman']","['David Howard', 'Robert Gordon']"

Gargoyles the Movie: The Heroes Awaken,Medieval stone creatures are roused from their long slumber to find their castle transported to New York.,"Pretty good.

I haven&apos;t seen any of the television series, but I still enjoyed this. The animation isn&apos;t top tier but it&apos;s a style that I do like, probably because it&apos;s the type I grew up with. The premise is connected together nicely, which is noteworthy as the film is made up of scenes from some of the TV episodes.

Keith David and Salli Richardson are, at least to me, the standouts from the cast, as they voice the roles of Goliath and Elisa. Jonathan Frakes, while, leads the others well as Xanatos. It&apos;s a very solid cast.

Général Idi Amin Dada: Autoportrait,A documentary on the military dictator of Africa&apos;s Uganda.,"After watching this documentary on Ugandan dictator Idi Amin, you&apos;d come to think that Forest Whitaker&apos;s award winning portrayal in The Last King of Scotland had given the military general more intellect, more cunning and definitely a more clear cut look at the nature of the man&apos;s evils. But in fact, from what you can glean from this documentary, he seemed to be more fuddy duddy, with surprising charisma whether or not due to his public demeanour, and his semi-illiterateness in the English Language (again, Whitaker made him sound grammatical).

Movies about political leaders are not new, and lately there&apos;s one that&apos;s also sanctioned by a leader himself, a made by a Singaporean documentary called A Hero&apos;s Journey, which presents a snapshot of the life of President Xanana Gusmao of Timor Leste. In this Idi Amin documentary, he has final word on what gets presented, and what not, and it&apos;s quite surprising that he&apos;s OK with making himself look like a buffoon, whether deliberate or not, leaves much to interpretation of his intent. You might say he wanted to show off what he can do, and what power he wields over his cronies, but on the other, there certainly are plenty of material which could easily have dented his popularity and aura.

Watching him go through his motions just brought about a thought, that evil men need not wear their evilness or ruthlessness on their sleeves. Here, Idi Amin might be the real life personification of The Joker, smiling on the outside, but inside his heart harbours thoughts similar to the mentioned villain. He&apos;s like a charismatic comedian, and makes it difficult not to laugh at his atrocities because he really does have a lot of funny ideas. His mastery of the English language is woeful, but that doesn&apos;t stop him from speaking it, and the filmmakers subtitling every grammatical error he&apos;s made too, instead of correcting it for an audience.

He&apos;s a self-professed soothsayer and an interpreter of dreams, and sends strange telegrams to various heads of state which reads like a script for a sitcom. He&apos;s often delusional as well, and some of the highlights of this documentary, which has to be seen to be believed, include his imaginary war games to take the Golan Heights from the Israelis given his very puny army, laughable air force and armour, and best of all, training his paratroopers on a children&apos;s slide. What cannot be missed as well, are his briefings to the country&apos;s doctors and to witness him holding court as one of his cabinet meetings, which was so full of contradictions and hare-brained ideas, you can&apos;t help but laugh at the farce of it all.

You can just imagine how any country could be run with jokers like these in power. He can&apos;t speak, can&apos;t communicate, and basically doesn&apos;t even know an iota about running a military (besides the rudimentary appreciation of semi-automatic weapons), let alone a country. He&apos;s full of personal prejudice and practices discrimination, but one thing&apos;s for sure, he&apos;s quite a musician, having contributed to the soundtrack of the film.

If you think you want to go beyond The Last King of Scotland to look at this dictator up close and personal, then this documentary should be your first step in trying to understand the contradiction which is His Excellency President for Life Field Marshal Al Hadji Dr. Idi Amin, VC, DSO, MC, King of Scotland Lord of All the Beasts of the Earth and Fishes of the Sea and Conqueror of the British Empire in Africa in General and Uganda in Particular (yes, that&apos;s his official title!)",8,['Documentary'],"['central africa', 'brutality', 'timeframe 1970s', 'dictator', 'uganda']",1976-08-30,['Barbet Schroeder'],"['Idi Amin', 'Fidel Castro', 'Golda Meir']",['Barbet Schroeder']

George Stevens: A Filmmaker&apos;s Journey,Biography of the Academy Award winning director including dramatic color footage of WWII.,"No one can fault George Stevens Jr. for not wanting to make the movie that really ought to be made about his father-- the decline of a once-nimble and always intelligent filmmaker into the bloated self-consciousness of his 1950s films and the suffocating self- importance of his virtually unwatchable final work. But this is a frustratingly superficial work that misses what&apos;s interesting about early Stevens so that it can lavish praise on the noble intentions that were so disastrous to the later work. For instance, Stevens&apos; apprenticeship at Hal Roach (where he directed Laurel and Hardy) is reduced to a soundbite about Stevens wanting a subtler approach to character-driven comedy than Roach-- as if Roach were Mack Sennett rather than the man who pioneered a subtler and more character-driven form of slapstick. If Stevens wanted to out-Roach Roach, that&apos;s surely a more interesting line of inquiry than making Roach out to be a hack. Likewise, Stevens is credited by Hermes Pan with inventing the idea of dance numbers that advanced the plot in Swing Time-- when seduction-by-dance had been a feature of the Astaire-Rogers films since The Gay Divorcee, and in any case it&apos;s doubtful how much Stevens would have had to do with the dance numbers&apos; form. It would have been far more interesting (not to mention accurate) to have a real film critic explore the development of Stevens&apos; style in these early house assignments, which in the end look like Stevens&apos; most consistently fine work. Conversely, when we get to the postwar period, we hear only about Stevens&apos; ideals and intentions, his encouragement of the actors and his technical innovations (Warren Beatty has a good anecdote to tell), but even well-chosen clips can&apos;t cover up the fact that Shane clothes a stock story in a handsomely muddly realism, that Giant is merely a ponderous soap opera, that Diary of Anne Frank, visually promising, is nearly unbearably wrong with those cute California kids telling each other Hallmark sentiments (in sadly ironic contrast to Stevens&apos; own home movies of the camps)-- and that The Ghastliest Story Ever Told, the aircraft carrier of Jesus movies, is not even a movie but a series of visually exquisite, dramatically deadly religious postcards. By this period, almost any other series of similar films would be more interesting to examine-- who wouldn&apos;t rather hear Nicholas Ray talk about They Live By Night, Johnny Guitar and King of Kings, say? Or Anthony Mann talk about Winchester 73 and El Cid? Or Pasolini talk about how he was inspired to make The Gospel According to St. Matthew by how wrongheaded Stevens&apos; Jesus was?",,"['Documentary', 'Biography']","['director', 'd day', 'filmmaking', 'dachau concentration camp', 'father son relationship']",1985-05-03,['George Stevens Jr.'],"['Fred Astaire', 'Warren Beatty', 'Pandro S.

Well, in this sense, I wasn&apos;t disappointed as once again Coburn played the sort of crotchety but lovable guy he so often played in films. However, sadly the film seemed like it was very strongly inspired by MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON (so it loses points for originality) and it unfortunately ended way too abruptly--like they knew it was supposed to be a B-picture so they ended it because this format wouldn&apos;t allow for a longer film! The film begins with the Colonel (Coburn) retiring to his childhood home in Georgia. Instead of just sitting back in a rocking chair, however, he wants to do a newspaper column to keep himself busy. At first, the column is very well received. However, when Coburn begins attacking the local corrupt administration, things start to get kind of crazy and soon it&apos;s this character and his new friends versus the establishment. This is all sort of a history lesson on politics and grassroots politics and when the mayor and his cronies dig in their heels for a fight the film gets interesting. Oddly, however, after setting up this great confrontation, it just seems to end! In the matter of just a couple minutes, everyone agrees to Coburn&apos;s demands and they all live happily ever after!! What a letdown at the end.

Overall, a pleasant and entertaining film that is worth watching but could have been even better.

Georgy Girl,A traditional girl (Lynn Redgrave) resists the advances of a swinger (James Mason) who wants her as his mistress in 1960s London.,"Georgy Girl is an amazing film that&apos;s was in the front of a new wave of more realistic, unblinking films by the Brits. The film doesn&apos;t flinch when depicting or talking about accidental pregnancy, abortion, mothers not interested in their babies. They&apos;re just a part of life, nothing to moralize about or to spotlight as big drama. Imagine any film from the U.S. in the mid 1960s taking on these issues at all, much less in the matter-of-fact way that Georgy Girl does. Georgy Girl and Darling strike me as two mid-60&apos;s British films that herald a new age--greater reality; women&apos;s freedom to choose partners and to define their romantic and sexual connections in their own way. Another very modern aspect of the film is the absence of any person taking the moral high ground; every character is on their own, and depicted irreverently, with warts, but also warmly.",8,"['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Romance']","['1960s', 'character name as title', 'nickname as title', 'forename in title', 'unable to bond with one&apos;s child']",1966-10-17,['Silvio Narizzano'],"['James Mason', 'Alan Bates', 'Lynn Redgrave']","['Margaret Forster', 'Peter Nichols']"
Tod für fünf Stimmen,"Works, legend and murders of Carlo Gesualdo, a notorious Italian composer and murderer from the 16th century.","(EDIT): As of 2005, this was my introduction to Herzog, and a fitting one. As a documentary I watched by him about a 16th century composer, it was captivating, strange, and of a certain macabre style that is probably in much of Herzog&apos;s work. I&apos;d heard of his films Aguirre, the Wrath of God, and Fitzcerraldo, both with stories that boggle the mind with their approach on life and dark subject matter (he&apos;s also worked with Klaus Kinski, a rather eccentric actor, if one can point out as such). 

This film, Gesualdo, puts focus on the 16th century composer in a fashion like Godard did with the Rolling Stones in Sympathy for the Devil. Half of the film is just music playing, giving an idea of what the musicians had to do. The other half skims the line between fiction and documentary, as the director sets up staged scenes to add to the deliberate atmosphere. It&apos;s still a documentary, but only in that you see it in the documentary style- some of this is scripted (likely).

The story of Gesualdo in and of itself could have made for a terrifying, awesome bio-pic from Herzog, but hearing the history anyway is fascinating enough. The composer of concertos was a Don in Italy, who in between composing his strange harmonies killed his first wife and child, and lived in exile for many years, including the last few of his life. There is the usual scholarly type who gives information about his life, but then there are also local historians, locals of the area, chefs, caretakers, and the buildings where he once lived and held his grand, renaissance-era parties and gatherings. The climax of the film- a celebration out in the streets, is something to see. It&apos;s not a long film at one hour, but it&apos;s worth the view.",8,"['Documentary', 'Biography', 'Crime']","['composer', 'carnival']",,['Werner Herzog'],"['Pasquale D&apos;Onofrio', 'Salvatore Catorano', 'Angelo Carrabs']",['Werner Herzog']
Get a Horse!,"Mickey, Minnie, Horace Horsecollar, and Clarabelle Cow go on a musical wagon ride until Peg-Leg Pete tries to run them off the road.","As a huge fan of classic Disney and as someone who likes a lot of their modern stuff(though there have been a fair share of misfires), Get a Horse was really delightful and while Frozen is a great film and one of their best since the Renaissance this short that preceded it was even better. The animation mixes black and white classic animation and colour CGI, with the crisp and fluid black and white and the colourful and vibrant CGI that moves more naturally than that on Mickey Mouse Clubhouse it not only looks great but it is very cleverly used as well. The soundtrack is lively and with beautiful orchestration and themes that you&apos;ll recognise immediately. The sound effects are well-incorporated, some from the very early stuff that are preserved quite well, and are not misplaced or bizarre-sounding. Get a Horse has humorous dialogue and a story that is from start-to-finish boundless fun and energy and it&apos;s as clever as the animation too. Just as good are the gags, they&apos;re reminiscent of classic Disney but there is also a very modern Disney vibe, so it will appeal to anybody, child and adult, regardless of where abouts they were born. All the characters engage, with a delicious villain in Pete and Mickey who has the kindly quality he has now and also the heroic character in the old classic Disney. Minnie is sweet as well, and it was great to see Horace and Clarabelle, two characters often neglected(or they were for a long time before House of Mouse came on the scene). The voices are fine too, though it was initially a tad odd hearing (modern) Pete voiced by someone other than Jim Cummings, like the sound the original voices are well-preserved. All in all, delightful and recommended without any hint of hesitation. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10,"['Animation', 'Short', 'Comedy']","['cow', 'disney', 'anthropomorphic animal', 'anthropomorphism', 'mouse']",2013-11-27,['Lauren MacMullan'],"['Walt Disney', 'Marcellite Garner', 'Russi Taylor']","['Lauren MacMullan', 'Paul Briggs', 'Nancy Kruse']"
The Ghost Writer,"A ghost writer, hired to complete the memoirs of a former British Prime Minister, uncovers secrets that put his own life in jeopardy.","From Knife in the Water and Rosemary&apos;s Baby to Chinatown, Roman Polanski has shown a skill at the slowly distributed thriller, and especially with a dash of hard-core politics as in Chinatown&apos;s Los Angeles water intrigues. Now in The Ghost Writer, the acclaimed director recaptures that Hitchcock sense of inevitable evil slowly stalking the rich and famous while the little guy protagonist witnesses the underbelly of power.

Ex-Prime Minister Andrew Lang (Pierce Brosnan) hires a ghost writer (Ewan McGregor) to finish an autobiography by the previous ghost writer, who mysteriously drowned. As unnamed ghost begins his work in a Martha&apos;s Vineyard hideaway of Lang, mayhem breaks out, for Lang is accused of sanctioning water boarding in the Iraq theater.

While it is apparent Lang&apos;s personal life is deteriorating as well, the ghost pursues with the tenacity of Jake Gittes the mystery of how his predecessor died, gaining a few bruised bones but not a broken nose for being nosy.

While the film has some clichéd situations, almost as if Polanski is trying to evoke &apos;70&apos;s thrillers in all their cheesiness, he has recruited an excellent cast. In addition to McGregor and Brosnan at their best, Tom Wilkinson as a suspicious Ivy League academic and a cameo by Eli Wallach as an old Vineyard denizen are so good that I wanted more of them. Polanski has always directed his actors well, but of course he is smart enough to hire them in the first place.

The stark; outdoor settings; the almost antiseptic interiors; the slowly suspenseful music; the car chases; the shower; and the suspicious ladies,especially the blond), are a few of the Hitchcock touches gracing the Ghost Writer. That Lang is unable to reside in only few countries of the world where he can&apos;t be extradited for crimes against humanity is a light reference to Polanski&apos;s own exile. For that allusion, I applaud him and wonder how he can keep a sense of humor amidst his possible imprisonment on charges of statutory rape.

However, he is after all a certifiable auteur whose legacy will outlive any prison time.",,"['Crime', 'Drama', 'Mystery']","['memoir', 'writer', 'ferry', 'political thriller', 'beach house']",2010-03-19,['Roman Polanski'],"['Ewan McGregor', 'Pierce Brosnan', 'Olivia Williams']","['Robert Harris', 'Roman Polanski']"

Ghosts of the Abyss,"James Cameron and Bill Paxton, director and actor of the 1997 film Titanic, travel to the final undersea resting place of the ill-fated ship of dreams.","As a big Titanic buff I was more than excited about the prospect of seeing more Titanic footage. I really had this movie built up in my mind and was so disappointed by it. Much of the film was wasted, in my estimation, of the process of getting to the Titanic rather than actually seeing it. Also, when you did have the image of the Titanic on the screen it was obstructed by two squares of other images......Cameron and Paxton viewing what you are TRYING to see. This was very frustrating to me. The 3D images were really good and that part was the positive side of this film.

In short, I feel James Cameron is more in love with himself than sharing the Titanic with the audience.

Cushing is quite dull in his role but he comes back at the end. John Hurt is completely miscast as the grumpy and perverted gardener. He actually plays the role very well and it&apos;s fun to see him do something interesting. He also invented a great new slap. He raises his hand and brings it down to chop the persons face with his fingers. I tried it and it&apos;s very painful! It shall be referred to as &apos;The ghoul slap&apos;. As for the movie, the rest of the cast is on good form and Ian McCulloch stars in a pre &apos;Zombi 2&apos; role. Still, he tries to take on the ghoul at the end and fails miserably. The atmosphere is superb with marshes and fog although the movie does run at a slow pace. Killings are the usual with stabbing&apos;s and shootings although some scenes have great special fx for gore. Particularly Ian McCulloch&apos;s demise. It is well worth a watch although it is very dodgy and quite slow. 5.5 out of 10.",,"['Horror', 'Thriller']","['hindu', 'psychotronic film', 'reference to kali the hindu deity', 'timeframe 1920s', 'motor race']",1975-06-01,['Freddie Francis'],"['Peter Cushing', 'John Hurt', 'Alexandra Bastedo']",['Anthony Hinds']

La casa della paura,"A sadistic killer cult kidnaps and sacrifices beautiful women. A young girl, just paroled from prison, moves into a strange house and appears to be the cult&apos;s next victim.","The Girl in Room 2a doesn&apos;t really fit in with a lot of the Giallo films released around their heyday back in the early seventies. The plot, as is the case with many of these films, focuses on murder; but there&apos;s very little mystery to it, the cinematography is entirely mundane and the plot just seems to settle as soon as the credits have rolled, which a direct contrast to the sprawling and over complicated story lines that most Giallo&apos;s feature. After the opening credits, you&apos;d be forgiven for thinking that you&apos;ve hit the Giallo jackpot, as we get to watch a screaming young woman skewered with a huge metal spike. From there we watch as her corpse is thrown off a cliff in order to make people believe that she in fact committed suicide. Soon thereafter, a young ex-inmate named Margaret moves into room 2a in a boarding house owned by Mrs Grant, who lives with her weird son Frank. Margaret soon meets a man named Jack, the brother of the girl killed at the start of the film and the two begin investigating the suicide, which he believes has something to do with Mrs Grant&apos;s boarding house.

Despite being slow, the film is at least interesting for the most part, and American director William L. Rose seems to have some sense of direction where the story is concerned, as it eventually comes to a point that mostly makes sense. The lack of mystery is a major negative point, however, and while I&apos;m not entirely sure whether you are meant to have guessed the identity of the murderers, it&apos;s so blindingly obvious that I find it hard to believe you weren&apos;t already supposed to know. The cast features just one name, and that belongs to sexy seductress Rosalba Neri...who is unfortunately wasted with a role that is far too small for illustrious persona. The locations didn&apos;t impress me much, as the film doesn&apos;t feature a lot of variety in this department, and the cinematography isn&apos;t exactly awe-inspiring. There are a couple of grisly murders - one of which is the one that happens before the opening credits. The lack of murders wouldn&apos;t have been a big problem for me, however, if the film was more exciting. Overall, Girl in Room 2a isn&apos;t the worst Giallo you&apos;re ever likely to see; but it certainly isn&apos;t the best, and I don&apos;t recommend going out of your way to find a copy.",6,"['Horror', 'Mystery', 'Thriller']","['female frontal nudity', 'whipping', 'gore', 'supernatural power', 'psychotronic film']",,"['William Rose', 'Dick Randall']","['Daniela Giordano', 'Angelo Infanti', 'John Scanlon']","['Gianfranco Baldanello', 'William Rose']"

It&apos;s a horror movie shot in black and white with great visuals and restrained performances, but it doesn&apos;t feel artsy or tedious. It finds time to let loose and have some wild sequences as well as the contemplative ones. I liked the characters, especially the central female.

Gladiator,A former Roman General sets out to exact vengeance against the corrupt emperor who murdered his family and sent him into slavery.,"Once again, Director Ridley Scott proves to be as professional as one can be. The recreation of ancient Rome is splendid, with all its magnificent buildings and atmosphere and he is able to show with all brightness the greatness of the Roman Empire, with its political problems and military discipline, and love and treason, of hate and jealousy, that still have a place in our world today. But the story has a glow of its own, to which all the beautiful scenery (believe me, it&apos;s awesome!!!) and great cinematography are just balancing factors. The plot is a rich one, that is as dynamic as it is present. He once again, after Blade Runner, 1492, and others helps us visit the depths of the human soul, which remains the same over all our historical and social experience. Even the fights, are displayed in such a way that all the blood is quite discrete, but still, making us feel like screaming and jumping out of our seats. I would also like to point out the performances of the cast, that is surprisingly good. We have some actors and actresses, who are not Hollywood icons, but are are greatly able to move the audience among screams and tears. All in all, we have guys like Russel Crowe, who are coming out to be part of a new and extremely promising harvest of people who are making each time more fans around the world.

Glen or Glenda,A psychiatrist tells the stories of a transvestite (Glen or Glenda) and a pseudohermaphrodite (Alan or Anne).,"Glen or Glenda (1953) 

** (out of 4) 

Edward D. Wood, Jr.&apos;s plea for tolerance against men who like to dress in women&apos;s clothing reminds us countless times that they aren&apos;t homosexuals but just transvestites. 

This is an extremely nutty little film that often times gets called one of the worst ever made but that&apos;s so far from the truth because movies that are among the worst ever made and never this entertaining. What makes this film so surreal is the fact that it comes off campy yet every single scene in the movie is trying to be so heartfelt and serious that the viewer just has to sit there and not believe what&apos;s going on in front of his eyes. 

You can tell that Wood was so serious in trying to get people to understand him and this is made even clearer by the director playing the role and Glen and Glenda. Wood&apos;s screenplay contains his usual off the wall dialogue, which while silly, is certainly entertaining. Wood always tries to be poetic with his dialogue and he manages to do so but at the same time this stuff is so out there that you can never take it too serious. 

Then, of course, you have Bela Lugosi playing some sort of scientist yet it&apos;s pretty clear he&apos;s suppose to be a God-like being. What can you really say about Lugosi? Sure, it&apos;s rather sad in a funny way to see someone like him in a movie like this but that just adds to the film&apos;s surreal charm. I must say that even though his dialogue is downright silly, Lugosi, always the professional, does a good job in his role. I&apos;m not sure if Lugosi actually knew what the film was going to be about but that fire and passion is still there for us to watch. 

Wood, the actor, isn&apos;t the best thing around but he&apos;s certainly no worse than what we usually see in a movie like this. Dolores Fuller, future songwriter for Elvis, plays Glen&apos;s girlfriend and does a pretty bad job but she does give us plenty of laughs. Lyle Talbot and Timothy Farrell are also on hand so more laughs here. 

When it&apos;s all said and done, there&apos;s no doubt this is a bad movie yet it&apos;s very original and I&apos;d even go a step further and say that it has a surreal nature about it that makes it strangely entertaining throughout.",,['Drama'],"['transgender interest', 'transgender', 'angora sweater', 'cross dressing', 'dream']",,['Edward D.

Godzilla 1985,"Thirty years after the original monster&apos;s rampage, a new Godzilla emerges and attacks Japan.","I firmly believe that Godzilla is criminally misunderstood in America. Much of this comes from the horrendous dubbings that we are often exposed to. The Americanized version even features Raymond Burr and a giant Dr. Pepper product placement. This makes it tough to take the film seriously on any level. I encourage you to search out the original version. You might be lucky enough to find it on ebay as a region 0 DVD. You won&apos;t find it in Blockbuster or most video stores.

Admittedly, it takes a special kind of person to search out the original, then look past the `special&apos; effects and see the metaphysical implications of a giant monster destroying mankind. This may or not be worth your time, but if you decide to watch this film, watch it, not as `Godzilla 1985,&apos; but as `Gojira 1984.&apos; Otherwise you might as well stick with the Devlin/Emmerich remake that&apos;s just as funny as the dubbed versions, but for all the wrong reasons.

Gojira X Mekagojira,A new Godzilla causes the JSDF to construct a cyborg countermeasure from the original monster&apos;s remains.

Shortly after that, Godzilla appears in Tateyama city. What&apos;s the connection ? The object that was moved out of Tateyama city was the remains of the original Godzilla that attacked Tokyo in 1954. Japanese special defense force JXSDF (Japan Counter-Xenomorph Self Defense Force) attacks Godzilla but it&apos;s weapons are ineffective against the Godzilla. Prime minister Takushoku (Kumi Mizuno) assembles a team of scientists to build a robot based on the original Godzilla&apos;s skeleton named Kiryu (Mechanical Dragon) to counter Godzilla&apos;s attack.

This movie had good special effects, the Mecha Godzilla (which only Dr. Uhara and his daughter refers to in this fasion in the movie) &apos;s design was by far the best of all Mechagodzillas. They really took the effort to get the details right on this movie with cool looking cargo planes Shirasagi (White Heron) to transport Kiryu from its base to battle ground. Yumiko Shaku&apos;s performance as Akane Yashiro was engaging, and acting was believable. The plot was good and the score which was performed by Moscow International Symphonic Orchestra was in my opinion best of all Godzilla series.

Gojira no gyakushû,Fishing scout-pilots are startled to discover a new monster named Anguirus alongside a second Godzilla. The monsters make their way towards Osaka as Japan can only brace for tragedy and relive the horror of Godzilla once more.,"Not the overpowering mandate against technological advances that Gozilla was, but nonetheless a good sequel that treats the Godzilla story reverently with realistic horrors of destruction, subtle humour, and interesting characters. The movie has some pockets of slow moving action, but the finale is a beautifully filmed scene of the creature being thwarted on an island of mountains and ice. The film has a Godzilla with a different look as well as another creature with a spiked back that destroy Osaka together. Characterization, as with the first Godzilla, lends the film some seriousness and realism. The destruction scenes in particular are nicely filmed, as they show a city in fear...and then destroyed. The film lacks Inshiro Hondo&apos;s directorial flair, but is well-shot and has a nice musical score to enhance it.",,"['Action', 'Horror', 'Sci-Fi']","['godzilla', 'tokusatsu', 'kaiju', 'gojira', 'creature feature']",1959-05-21,"['Motoyoshi Oda', 'Ishirô Honda']","['Hiroshi Koizumi', 'Setsuko Wakayama', 'Minoru Chiaki']","['Takeo Murata', 'Shigeaki Hidaka', 'Shigeru Kayama']"

Gold Diggers of 1933,"A wealthy composer rescues unemployed Broadway performers with a new play, but insists on remaining anonymous.","New York City - the height of the Great Depression. Four showgirls, starving, scheming for that next role in a Broadway musical comedy. Looking for the Big Break. Auditioning for every part. Often down, but never downhearted. Using men, loving men, cheating men. These are the GOLD DIGGERS OF 1933.

This is a wonderful comedy - funny, tuneful & easy on the intellect. Plus, the magic of Busby Berkeley&apos;s musical numbers. It&apos;s the kind of entertainment that kept audiences happy for a few hours during the dark days of economic despair in the early 1930&apos;s.

The cast is first-rate: brassy Joan Blondell; cynical Aline MacMahon; innocent Ruby Keeler & on-the-make Ginger Rogers. Keeler lands handsome & mysterious Dick Powell, (who gets to croon some attractive Harry Warren tunes); and acerbic but loyal producer Ned Sparks.

Warren William & Guy Kibbee turn up late in the proceedings, playing priggish bluenoses who are nonetheless highly susceptible to alcohol & feminine wiles. Movie mavens will recognize Charles Lane as a society reporter; Ferdinand Gottschalk as a disgruntled club member; and Sterling Holloway as a messenger boy.

Some years back, in an introduction to a book about THE WIZARD OF OZ&apos;s Munchkins, dwarf Billy Barty stated that he was `too young&apos; to appear in that 1939 movie. This, of course, is nonsense, and he can easily be spotted in the `Pettin&apos; In The Park&apos; number here. As he would in FOOTLIGHT PARADE, he rather disturbingly portrays a lecherous tot, a sure indication, if nothing else, that this is a pre-Production Code film.

Mr. Berkeley does get to have some fun. The film starts with `We&apos;re In The Money&apos; featuring Ginger Rogers & girls clad in coins large & small; Rogers even gets to sing one chorus in pig Latin. `Pettin&apos; In The Dark&apos; extols the joys of bucolic lovemaking, segues to simulated, silhouetted female nudity and rather bizarrely ends with the chorus all metal-corseted (Powell is given a can opener to use on Keeler). `The Shadow Waltz&apos; is Berkeley at his most romantic, with its helix-skirted ladies pretending to play fluorescent, fake violins, all moving in a multitude of weaving patterns staged for the famous overhead camera shots. The film&apos;s emotional punch comes at the end, with Blondell&apos;s tempestuous rendition of `Remember My Forgotten Man&apos; - with its endless marching men, a blues wail for the doughboys of the Great War, ruined by the Depression. The movie ends on this somber note. (Powell also gets to warble `I&apos;ve Got To Sing A Torch Song&apos;).

And just who are those hilarious, Yiddish Kentucky Hillbillies, anyway?",10,"['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Musical']","['dancing', 'chorus girl', 'neighbor', 'dance', 'broadway manhattan new york city']",1933-05-27,['Mervyn LeRoy'],"['Warren William', 'Joan Blondell', 'Aline MacMahon']","['Erwin Gelsey', 'James Seymour', 'David Boehm']"

Harryhausen really captures the atmosphere of the Arabian Nights. There is adventure, mystery, terror, love, comedy, and some pretty good sword fights. I&apos;ll put the six-armed Kali up against the skeleton from the Seventh Voyage of Sinbad any day. And Tom Baker&apos;s wizard is far more evil.

GoldenEye,,"World security is in danger , ¨Janus¨ , a terrorist organization has robbed the ¨Goldeneye¨ , an ultra secret weapon system -a spy satellite- and menaced to use it for destroying a city if doesn&apos;t pay and to cause a sabotage on the global financial markets .

Goldfinger,"While investigating a gold magnate&apos;s smuggling, James Bond uncovers a plot to contaminate the Fort Knox gold reserve.","I wouldn&apos;t put too much money on it, but in a small friendly wager, I&apos;d be willing to bet that those who are Bond fans like Goldfinger best of all Bond films. Especially those who think Sean Connery is the best and only man whoever should have played 007.

Certainly the most dangerous opponent Bond ever faced was Odd Job, who was Auric Goldfinger&apos;s bodyguard and all around assassin. I believe he was the most dangerous opponent James Bond ever fought with in all of his films. Watch that fight scene that Harold Sakata had with Sean Connery, he&apos;s got Connery almost down for the count. Fighting skills can only carry you so far when your opponent outweighs you and is built like a brick outhouse. In fact it&apos;s only sheer trickery in which Connery overcomes Sakata in a shocking conclusion.

As for Gert Frobe who was Goldfinger he&apos;s the ultimate Bond villain with the ultimate plan. He&apos;s even got his men fooled who think they&apos;re going to rob Fort Knox so he can corner the world&apos;s gold supply. Actually Goldfinger plans to blow up Fort Knox with an atomic bomb and then he&apos;ll really corner the market. Of course it&apos;s up to 007 to stop him.

The Bond girls are more luscious than ever with two of them, Shirley Eaton and Tania Millet meeting their demise. Eaton was the famous golden girl who Goldfinger suffocated by painting her entire body with gold paint. And of course there&apos;s Honor Blackman who switched sides do to the charms of James Bond. Who can ever forget a character name like Pussy Galore.

I well remember when Goldfinger was released in 1964 just in time for the presidential campaign. The Republican candidate was Barry Goldwater that year for you young people, not alive at the time. Poor Barry was busy defending himself from charges that he would scrap Social Security, sell the Tennessee Valley Authority and lob one into the men&apos;s room at the Kremlin. So all he needed was a film to come out with a master villain with a name so similar. The Democrats had a field day spoofing the title song that Shirley Bassey made such a hit from.

Without the Goldwater reference, Goldfinger is still a great action film, one of the best of Bond.",8,"['Action', 'Adventure', 'Thriller']","['official james bond series', 'gold', 'aston martin', 'race against time', 'british secret service']",1965-01-09,['Guy Hamilton'],"['Sean Connery', 'Gert Fröbe', 'Honor Blackman']","['Richard Maibaum', 'Paul Dehn', 'Ian Fleming']"

There are a few good scenes in this film, but they could have turned this into an amazing 15 minute short instead of making me suffer. It&apos;s crazy to think that from an original 5 hour rough cut they couldn&apos;t find better material to pack into this film.

"Goodbye, Mr. Chips",An aged teacher and former headmaster of a boarding school recalls his career and his personal life over the decades.,"Goodbye Mr Chips must be one of the best films ever made.

The acting of boys, masters and other characters is superb, as is the capturing of the late Victorian/Edwardian period in England, the joy of 1914 on the declaration of war, followed by the sombre roll-calls of the dead in chapel during the war years.

The character of Chips is an instruction in how someone&apos;s life can be transformed for the better by fortuitous events, in this case the meeting on the mountain between Chips and Katherine, which changed him from being a shy but well-meaning schoolmaster who found it difficult to establish a rapport with his pupils and colleagues into someone whose hidden depths and charisma were brought into view by a woman he loved.

This gentle, decent and moving film illustrates, through both Chips and Katherine, the importance of giving of oneself to others who in their turn will benefit as human beings; concepts which might seem outdated in our modern world but remain valuable and timeless.",10,"['Drama', 'Romance']","['boarding school', 'boys&apos; school', 'latin language', 'school', 'headmaster']",1939-07-28,"['Sam Wood', 'Sidney Franklin']","['Robert Donat', 'Greer Garson', 'Terry Kilburn']","['R.C.

The Gore Gore Girls,A young reporter enlists the help of a top notch private eye to solve the murder of a female stripper at a Chicago nightclub.,"SPOILER: The last gore film of Herschell Gordon Lewis is perhaps one of his goriest and remarkably one of his funniest..intentional and unintentional. Lewis has eyeballs squeezed, nipples cut off of breasts with scissors(one breast has white liquid flowing while another has chocolate), a woman&apos;s rump bludgeoned and then salted, a host of throats slit, a woman being run over by a truck, and a woman having her face shoved in a boiling bowl of french fries(you might have noticed in this scene that the pot was tall and not very wide in the first shot prior to the actress having her face embedded in the pot then in the close-up the pot is short and wide to accomodate her face). No question about it, the film definitely has a misogynistic edge to it. Women are beaten and killed senselessly(isn&apos;t that every Lewis film?). The story about an amateur detective being paid by a newspaper to solve the crime was not THAT bad...certainly better than most plot constructs used in other Lewis vehicles. Frank Kress as Abraham Gentry certainly also is one of the best actors ever used in a lead in a Lewis film. His acting style was fresh and he could convey irony and wit. The rest of the cast was so-so, with lots of naked girls jiggling(none of them particularly attractive and looking in that sleazy, has-been 70&apos;s kind of fashion). Henny Youngman, the only big name to grace any of Lewis&apos;s horror films, stars as a night club owner and talks so fast you will have trouble hearing what he says! Lewis wants to sicken you in this film, but he also goes for the laughs and some of them work. The photographers in each murder scene are hilarious as is the general mood of the film when some poor girl isn&apos;t losing appendages, skin, or having her eyes gouged out. The score is like some sleazy jazz theme and Lewis even has the temerity to use pieces of classical music and opera such as the Anvil Chorus. Despite all the twisted killing, the film kind of grew on me. Now, maybe I am the sick one. Watch out for the ending...it is Lewis having some more fun...and the revelation of the killer is one of the most ludicrous explanations put on film.

Gothika,"A depressed psychiatrist wakes up as a patient in the asylum where she worked, with no memory of why she is there or what she has done.","I have read many reviews that seemed to think Gothika was a waste of time. Let me just say, it is not a waste of time. in fact, the film was very enjoyable. it was shot well and the special effects were sophisticated and well handled. The cast was full of surprises such as Bernard Hill(great actor but a strange role). The story was interesting and there was genuine tension throughout.

Berry&apos;s character is a doctor in a mental institute. she wakes up to find herself an inmate in the very place she works. Her colleague and friend played by robert downy jnr tells her that she has committed a horrific crime and nobody knows why. so the plot begins to wind its way towards a shadowy truth. However, without giving anything away, the key scenes where important truths are revealed to the audience are simply too clumsy. information is just handed over visually on a plate and leaves little to the imagination. some of the tension built up in

the first half of the film is lost. and the truth isn&apos;t quite as gripping and terrifying as we would have hoped(although thats not to

say it is pleasant).

Robert Zemeckis was one of the producers and i think it shows..there is some great camera work and some really interesting ideas but gothika doesn&apos;t have some of the subtle touches that What Lies Beneath had, but its easy to see some of the parallels between the two films.

Even though halle berry wears the same look of shocked disbelief throughout the film, she plays it with conviction. and a supporting role from penelope cruz certainly doesn&apos;t take anything away from berry.

all in all, gothika provides a good story, an average screen play and enough innovative ideas to keep its audience. but i would have been disappointed if i had paid to watch it at the cinema.",,"['Horror', 'Mystery', 'Thriller']","['psychiatrist', 'female protagonist', 'rape', 'psychiatric hospital', 'female full frontal nudity']",2003-11-21,['Mathieu Kassovitz'],"['Halle Berry', 'Penélope Cruz', 'Robert Downey Jr.']",['Sebastian Gutierrez']

This was the tale of Gustave H, the legendary and infamous Concierge of The Grand Budapest Hotel, a rather glamorous edifice perched atop a mountain and his protégé and most trusted friend Zero, The Lobby Boy. This is a tale of friendship, murder, revenge and deep dark plotting.

Les raisins de la mort,A young woman discovers that the pesticide being sprayed on vineyards is turning people into killer zombies.,"This neglected cult classic is finally available for the first time in the States, on DVD with a gorgeous looking (and sounding) transfer by Synapse Films. It looks great - probably better than it did in the theatres. Not exactly a zombie flick, but that is the closest genre you could categorize it. It follows the trials of Elizabeth, a young woman traveling by rail across the French countryside, en route to meet with her fiancé, who runs a winery. Before she reaches her destination however, she encounters a homicidal man who has just murdered her traveling companion, and whose face disintegrates before her horrified eyes as he chases her off the train. Lost in the rural expanse, the woman encounters various peasants who seem to have become trapped between life and death, driven mad by the pain of decaying alive, and more than eager to throttle her and visit various abuses upon her body (implied by the fact that any uninfected individual she comes across in her adventure inevitably takes the proverbial bullet for her - by pitchfork, hatchet, or whatever lethal tool the living `dead&apos; have at hand at the moment). Finally, it is revealed that her fiancé has been pumping out wine tainted by pesticides, which has been consumed en masse earlier at a festival by the unfortunate villagers (talk about becoming dead drunk.). This is easily one of Rollin&apos;s most accessible films, but may not be to the tastes of anyone weaned on Empty-Vee styled horror flicks.

For most of America the Depression started with the stock market crash of 1929. But for the farmers it really began at the end of World War I. Those were good years for agriculture, the war in Europe was a boom for agriculture. But when farm prices dropped after the Armistice, a whole lot of family farms went belly up. Lots of people left the farms for the big city and industry jobs. The Depression years unhappily coincided with some of the worst drought ever seen in America.

This is what many families like the Joads were facing in 1939 when the book was written. The banks had foreclosed on land that had withered to dust in any event. Folks like the Joads picked up and moved elsewhere, like California on a rumor of prosperity and jobs. 

America was still changing from an agricultural to an industrial society back then. That causes a lot of trouble for people unskilled in any industrial job training. As a country we&apos;re going through something similar today in many areas. We&apos;re moving from an industrial to an information based economy. Industry jobs are being lost to other nations and older and poorer workers are suffering for it. It&apos;s progress I guess, but it takes its toll.

Some factory worker who has lost his job for any number of reasons can identify to some degree with the Joads, especially if they&apos;ve lost a home they owned. For the Joads it was worse because they made their living off the land for many generations, identifying with it in a way that industrial workers could not.

Henry Fonda got his first Oscar nomination for Tom Joad. To get the part which he knew he was so right for, he signed a studio contract with 20th Century Fox. That caused him many problems later on, but those are stories for another film review. 

Tom Joad is a midwest country kid, a whole lot like Fonda himself. Part of the story of The Grapes of Wrath is Tom himself trying to figure out why these economic forces are crushing him and his family and the way of life he&apos;s known. In the end when he leaves the Joad family and hits the open road, he&apos;s not got all the answers, but he&apos;s asking the questions. Tom hasn&apos;t figured it out, but a lot of people with many letters after their names haven&apos;t either. He only knows that he&apos;s got to get in the fight for economic justice.

Jane Darwell was in films from the earliest silent films to Mary Poppins in 1965. This became her career part and the mother role of all time. She&apos;s what holds the Joad family together in good times and bad. That&apos;s what moms do and get little recognition for it. Except in this case by the Motion Picture Academy.

John Carradine has his career part in this also. Another John Ford favorite, Carradine plays Casy the defrocked preacher who as he tells it disgraced himself with a female parishioner. After that preaching the gospel didn&apos;t seem quite right. When Fonda meets Carradine after Fonda&apos;s been released from prison, Carradine is asking a lot of questions about what is man&apos;s place in the metaphysical scheme of things. He&apos;s developing what we would now call situational ethics. Carradine&apos;s questions are on a higher plane, but he certainly inspires Fonda to ask for some answers himself.

The Grapes of Wrath illustrates that at least government can give first aid in a crisis. After being in privately run agricultural camps where they&apos;re treated like less than dirt, the Joads happen upon a camp run by the Department of Agriculture where at least they&apos;re treated like humans. As it turns out, the Secretary of Agriculture was one Henry A. Wallace who was running for Vice President that year with Franklin D. Roosevelt. I&apos;ll bet any number of people saw The Grapes of Wrath and saw a message of support for FDR and the New Deal.

Given some of the problems of the American economy today, The Grapes of Wrath though it appears dated isn&apos;t really all that much a relic of our past. It&apos;s both a timeless book and a timeless classic film.",10,['Drama'],"['great depression', 'based on novel', 'capitalism', 'national film registry', 'bakersfield california']",1940-03-15,['John Ford'],"['Henry Fonda', 'Jane Darwell', 'John Carradine']","['Nunnally Johnson', 'John Steinbeck']"
The Gravedancers,"After a night of drunken exploits, Allison, Harris, and Kira are chased and terrorized by the ghosts of a child pyromaniac, an ax murderer, and a rapist.","I didn&apos;t know what to expect from the so called horror fest this weekend but I liked the trailer for The Grave Dancers so I picked this one to go see at the theater. I liked the way the movies characters both live and ghostly inter acted together and how the story moved and flowed through different characters&apos; personal issue. The film had really good make up and the camera work and shooting was a real eye opener. It was well done. The story at times was predictable at times but the last few scenes really kicks it into high geared as the ghosts let it be known that they are not happy and become completely visible. At times it was a actually funny but I like to be positive and not just trash films because you have to have a level of respect for anyone who creates a film and gets it into a theater of any kind. I did like the fact that the writers didn&apos;t feel they needed to be a complete gore slasher type film, so often now blood and guts is king and I don&apos;t always need to see all that if it isn&apos;t needed to pull off the story. I recommend this film to anyone looking for a good horror type film that doesn&apos;t have to have blood coming from all angles to make you feel a little spooked.",6,['Horror'],"['psychotronic film', 'ghost', 'rapist', 'curse', 'cemetery']",2008-08-27,['Mike Mendez'],"['Dominic Purcell', 'Clare Kramer', 'Josie Maran']","['Brad Keene', 'Chris Skinner']"

I was not expecting that much watching this movie. I thought about a bad C movie with a cheap producing. Already in the first minutes I realized that my thoughts were wrong.

I really enjoyed the movie very much. It&apos;s an elegant mix of comedy and horror, where the classification in the one or the other scope is not always obvious. Both genre are successfully assisted by the whole techniques and instruments of film making.

The story is pretty flat but that is not the point of the movie and you won&apos;t miss it. The focus is much more on the presentation of the different scenes, underlined by some suitable/ non suitable music, and good camera views. Last but not least the screenplay is pretty smart, so that you won&apos;t always know if you what you are watching is supposed fright or make you laugh.

The First Great Train Robbery,"England, 1850s. A master criminal aims to rob a train of a large sum of gold. Security is incredibly tight and the task seems an impossible one. However, he has a plan and just the right people to carry it out.","The Great Train Robbery follows the standard heist movie blueprint. The team gets assembled to pull off an impossible job, they do all of the complicated prep work, then there is a last minute complication that makes it much more difficult than they expected. What stands out here is the setting, Victorian England, and the much smaller crew of thieves than usual. Most heist movies have a huge crew of 10+ characters that each need to have their characters explored. Here there is just the mastermind (Sean Connery), the pickpocket (Donald Sutherland), the girl (Lesley-Anne Downs), and the greaseman (Wayne Sleep). There are a few others, but their characters are so minor that they do not even get names. Rather than get sidetracked covering side characters, there is a strong focus on moving the plot forward that makes the entire movie more interesting.

What also stands out is the impressive stunts that were done mostly without stuntmen. Wayne Sleep really scales a wall and Sean Connery really walks across the top of a moving train. In today&apos;s CGI heavy film industry, it is refreshing to see an older movie that stays simpler with its big stunts, but they feel much realer, because they are. A lot of the movie relies on Sean Connery&apos;s natural charisma, which is the secret to a good heist movie, and Connery holds up very well compared to Clooney and Sinatra in the Ocean&apos;s movies and Newman and Redford in The Sting.",7,"['Adventure', 'Crime', 'Drama']","['train robbery', 'based on true story', 'based on novel', '1850s', 'gold']",1979-02-02,['Michael Crichton'],"['Sean Connery', 'Donald Sutherland', 'Lesley-Anne Down']",['Michael Crichton']

The Green Inferno,"A group of student activists travels to the Amazon to save the rain forest and soon discover that they are not alone, and that no good deed goes unpunished.","OK, now I had no idea this movie was &apos;anticipated&apos;, nor did I ever see Cannibal Holocaust (although I saw fragments), so I guess this is as fair of a review as any - although I do like Eli Roth and try to see most of his work, finding some good and some bad - so I&apos;m pretty open either way. 

One of the first issues I have is seeing Richard Burgi in a minor appearance. Don&apos;t get me wrong, I love the guy since &apos;sentinel&apos;, But him being cast previously in Hostel (and killed), and seeing Roth has a cult following most of whom have therefore seen mr. Burgi before, is spoiling the illusion of realism. There was no reason not to use a fresh face.

You will get what you came for: cannibals, dismemberments, and flesh-eating. We also get some torture, female genitalia mutilation, and mass zombie-like behavior as well, the last of which seemed out of place and unrealistic. Some parts are silly and not in a good way, I can&apos;t tell which ones (spoiler). Some minor CGI, can&apos;t tell... (spoiler).

There are some nice &apos;setups&apos; in the movie, and I applaud it for that. We aren&apos;t merely talking about a documentary, we have people with an actual agenda and some twists. Ariel Levy does a great job in being unlikeable and providing a story arc, evolving into a near psychopathic personality. 

The movie got a little carried away with some methods that ruined the realism, but to each his own. To me, that&apos;s what hurt the most. The way how the movie wraps itself up makes little sense, we get some ideas thrown in that didn&apos;t really work, combine or satisfy - but that&apos;s just the last 2 minutes.

In all, a careful recommendation to the fans of the genre.",6,"['Adventure', 'Horror']","['cannibal', 'female circumcision', 'masturbation', 'eye cut out', 'tongue cut off with knife']",2015-09-25,['Eli Roth'],"['Lorenza Izzo', 'Ariel Levy', 'Aaron Burns']","['Eli Roth', 'Guillermo Amoedo']"

Beyond the surface this movie harpoons the great competitions of man versus man, man versus nature, man versus God and man versus himself. What the director was able to accomplish in this raw film is an inspiration. A man evolving from suicidal tendencies, a man who protected life but initially cares little of his own, revealed his true flesh of wanting to live. The ethereal remembrances provided a cloudy peek into his pain. The parallels of the pack of wolves and the pack of men within the indifferent universe. Oh my fellow watchers this visceral movie gives us hope, purpose and the untethered pang of raw survival. To rage against the cold, while the hungry wolves that lurk in our souls attempt to devour us. Those that rate this movie poorly lack the honed taste of organic storytelling.

Gymkata,An American gymnast travels to a foreign country to compete in a deadly game not won by anyone other than a native in more than 900 years.,"There&apos;s much more to this film that meets the eye. Director Robert Clouse, with the help of a sharp, powerful and precise script, did a brilliant job of merging two viewpoints as different as the Eastern philosophy of martial arts with the western culture of achievements and rapid success. Our hero, Jonathan Cabot, has to deal with the success of being an Olympic superstar, as shown in the first moments of the film, but deep inside all he longs for is to live the normal family life he&apos;s been denied, as we can see in the scene where he reflects on his father&apos;s photograph. To achieve this end, he spares no effort, and even for such an accomplished athlete as him, it is no easy task, despite being helped by experts from the East and West.

And then, we meet the Princess. Mere words can not convey the feelings of tenderness when these two characters meet. John is vulnerable and looking for someone to love, but the princess will show him that we are most vulnerable when we open our hearts. I believe Tetchie Agbayani achieved a pinnacle in the history of acting with her subtle, yet powerful portrayal of the modern woman who is afraid to love openly, yet longs for romantic fulfillment. However, these two characters soon find that they were meant to complement each other. Here is when Clouse&apos;s mastery of the film medium shows: most other films would have given us a long, pointless scene full of sex. But Clouse shows admirable restraint, instead showing us the passion these two people share for each other in a way that invites us to contemplate how love can bridge cultural differences. In a sense, it is nothing more than the tale of Romeo and Juliet, modernized. He must fight to avenge his father and bring hope to his country. She must help him even at the risk of betraying her nation and her father, because she knows it will be best. Clouse brings us a sharp critique of the shallowness of modern relationships.

Then, after some exciting scenes in varied mid-eastern locals we see how our hero, despite his extensive training and mastery of the lethal arts, does not reject help from unlikely sources. It is a complete surprise to see his mentor appear and save him, and this establishes a bond of trust, furthering the moral of the movie. Not before long, we are then shown to the beautiful country of Parmistan, where Richard Norton does a fine job of portraying a villain with a tender side, and Buck Kartalian shines as the benevolent ruler of a small country torn between tradition and modernization. The scenery only serves to further enhance this impression, accompanied by exemplary photography.

In short, this film is an almost perfect portrayal of personal growth and the triumph of love and hope over adversity. Truly a must-see for aspiring actors, directors and screenwriters.",,"['Action', 'Thriller']","['gymnastics', 'martial artist', 'kung fu classic', 'kung fu', 'chop socky']",1985-05-03,['Robert Clouse'],"['Kurt Thomas', 'Tetchie Agbayani', 'Richard Norton']","['Charles Robert Carner', 'Dan Tyler Moore']"

The Hallelujah Trail,"On its way to Denver, a cargo of whiskey destined for the miners, is sought after by the Temperance League, the U.S. Cavalry, the local Indians and the miners themselves.","The Hallelujah Trail is a spoof of the type of epic Western epitomized by such movies as Cimarron (1960) and How the West Was Won (1962).

The miners, headquartered in Denver, are threatened by thirst. The town&apos;s whiskey stocks, for what is expected to be a long, cold winter, are dangerously low. A wagon train of teamsters, led by Brian Keith, is hired to deliver more whiskey. The temperance ladies, led by Lee Remick, are trying to stop the whiskey. The Native Americans, a key figure among whom we will get to shortly, are trying to steal the whiskey. The cavalry, led by Burt Lancaster as assisted by Jim Hutton, is trying to maintain order. This leads to what is recorded, in the annals of the comedy West, as the Battle of...well, that would be giving too much plot away.

There are three memorable performances, all in supporting roles. One comes from the unseen narrator, who helps to chronicle events with his resonant voice and his, uh, uh, special...insight. Another comes from Martin Landau (Crimes and Misdemeanors, the TV series Mission Impossible). Landau plays Walks Stooped Over, a Native American who, from his role in peace negotiations, also goes by the name Symbol of Good Faith. Then we get to the sterling performance, which should have drawn an Oscar nomination. It comes from Donald Pleasance (James Garner&apos;s nearly blind POW buddy in The Great Escape). Pleasance plays Oracle, a visionary Denverite who is able to foresee the future, except that he first requires, uh, uh, lubrication.

I can think of only two other movies of approximately the same genre. At the head of the class, of course, is It&apos;s a Mad Mad Mad Mad World (1963). The other is the Japanese movie, Welcome Back, Mr. McDonald (1997). Okay, maybe three other movies. The extra one being Airplane! (1980).

Halloween,"Fifteen years after murdering his sister on Halloween night 1963, Michael Myers escapes from a mental hospital and returns to the small town of Haddonfield, Illinois to kill again.","To begin, this is a twenty year old film. Few films remain as suspenseful today as they did when it came out. (see: Night of the Living Dead -- had people running from the theatres when released but is very tame today). Clearly a movie fan brought up on the standards of today&apos;s movies will fail to find enjoyment of such &apos;classic&apos; films. But when watching Halloween today perhaps it helps to consider a few things: Halloween was a low budget film (read: bad acting, poor special effects) made for only $300,000. It was not a product of Hollywood but a bunch of 20 year olds. This was the first film to feature the Boogeyman that Wouldn&apos;t Die which has been ripped off time and time again in the Friday the 13th, Elm Street, Scream, etc. You&apos;re used to it now, but Halloween did it first. Even Scream ripped off the look of the villian in Halloween. The theme of teenagers being stalked by a madman has been ripped of numerous times as well (again, Halloween did it first) but what seperates Halloween from the imitators is that it plays on traditional fears: The Thing that Wouldn&apos;t Die; the Boogeyman coming to get you; being followed and stalked; the boyfriend returning to the room under a bedsheet -- and it&apos;s not really him; someone hiding in the car... all things that have made our skin crawl in real life at one time or another. Watching Halloween tonight again for the first time in years I found myself again on the edge of my seat. Classic? Hell, yes. Maybe not to a generation who feels Scream was a &apos;good&apos; horror movie but a classic none the less.",,"['Horror', 'Thriller']","['halloween', 'babysitting', 'year 1978', 'stabbed to death', 'homicidal maniac']",1978-10-27,['John Carpenter'],"['Donald Pleasence', 'Jamie Lee Curtis', 'Tony Moran']","['John Carpenter', 'Debra Hill']"

Halloween III: Season of the Witch,Kids all over America want Silver Shamrock masks for Halloween. Doctor Daniel Challis seeks to uncover a plot by Silver Shamrock owner Conal Cochran.,"Let&apos;s get some things straight...

The only real reason people seem to hate this film is because Michael Myers was absent.

For those who don&apos;t know, John Carpenter and crew decided since Michael Myers was dead at the end of HalloweeN II, there was no reason to continue on with his story. The decision was to go ahead with the series making each new installment a different story revolving around the Halloween season. Personally, I think this was a wise decision. But after everyone saw it they were screaming &apos;That wasn&apos;t a Halloween movie! Where was Michael?&apos;. Obviously the majority of the audience would rather more Michael Myers rampages than creepy stories set around Halloween time.

Oh well, this movie gives a taste of where the series could have and should have went, before the disappointing HalloweeN 4.

Overall, the acting is top notch. Tom Atkins is a great actor. The soundtrack is one of my favorite John Carpenter scores ever. It has themes, but it&apos;s more about synthesized mood and pulsating rhythms. The cinematography by the great Dean Cundey is fabulous. And the entire feel of the film is very unsettling. The film literally freaks me out.

I recommend all of you that diss the film, to check it out once more. Keep an open mind. If this hadn&apos;t been a part of the HalloweeN series you would probably like it.

As for myself, I&apos;m glad that this carries the HalloweeN title. Th rest of the films didn&apos;t pick up until HalloweeN H2O which is a very worthy entry.",,"['Horror', 'Mystery', 'Sci-Fi']","['halloween', 'stonehenge', 'factory', 'northern california', 'curfew']",1982-10-22,['Tommy Lee Wallace'],"['Tom Atkins', 'Stacey Nelkin', 'Dan O&apos;Herlihy']","['Tommy Lee Wallace', 'John Carpenter', 'Nigel Kneale']"
Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers,"Ten years after his original massacre, the invalid Michael Myers awakens on Halloween Eve and returns to Haddonfield to kill his seven-year-old niece. Can Dr. Loomis stop him?","After a seven year absence from the screen, Michael Myers returns. Set ten years after the first two films (#2 was filmed in 1981, but set immediately after #1 in 1978), THE RETURN OF MICHAEL MYERS opens with the infamous killer being transfered between psyhiciatric hospitals. Naturally, he escapes, and, tipped off that he has a niece (daugther of the now-deceased Jamie Lee Curtis character) living in Haddonfield, sets out to find her. Hot on his trail, as always, is Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence). After some were turned off by the more-gruesome deaths in HALLOWEEN 2, this film is more in-line with the original, relying more heavily on suspense and honest scares than blood and gore. For a nine-year-old, Harris delivers a good performance, and Donald Pleasence (as usual) is also good, with a performance that lets you know this is a been-there-don&apos;t-want-to-go-through-that-again character. Director Dwight H. Little brings a sense of atmosphere to the film and creates a number of suspenseful scenes. Thankfully, the make-shirt mob of gun-toting beer-guzzlers isn&apos;t as bad as it could have been. HALLOWEEN 4 is one of the best of the series.",,"['Horror', 'Thriller']","['serial killer', 'halloween', 'small town', 'masked villain', 'michael myers character']",1988-10-21,['Dwight H.

Ah-ga-ssi,"A woman is hired as a handmaiden to a Japanese heiress, but secretly she is involved in a plot to defraud her.","The Handmaiden is a film that unfolds with a classic film stylist (in particular I felt like Chanwook Park was in a kind of Brian De Palma mode as far as making an erotic dramatic-thriller with a camera that luxuriates in long shots, elaborate camera movements, and cinematic grammar that emphasizes operatic intentions, though it&apos;s maybe not the first time he&apos;s done this anyway), and is LOADED with story. What appears to be the story of a handmaiden who is put in as part of a long con by a man who wants to steal this wealthy woman&apos;s money is actually a story about storytelling, about weaving a pack of lies and an entire personality and, in reality, how that can start to crack apart when it comes to seeing humanity in another person and their vulnerabilities.

There&apos;s a lot going on in this movie, and there is a lot that is... sordid and over the top in its sexuality. That&apos;s intentional, I&apos;m sure, and Park never coddles his audience with what he&apos;s showing as far as sexuality; the two main women of the film, the handmaiden and her master/mistress or what have you, end up having an emotional connection and this leads to a sexual one. This has the most graphic lesbian sexuality on screen since Blue is the Warmest Color, but here the rawness is matched by the elegance of Park&apos;s direction, and while you get to see much of it, only some of it (but there *is* some) that is gratuitous. Otherwise, this is a story of backstabbing and betrayal, but all of it leading up to being in the larger sense about how people fit in to the circumstances they are in, how they have to not simply play but BECOME the characters they&apos;re playing - and how these images flip based on perceptions and how we see the scenes.

Here&apos;s where I may become less articulate in my criticism: the film is in three parts, and I forgot about there being &apos;parts&apos; as I was so into the film during its first part. There is a major betrayal, but then the movie goes into a &apos;Part 2&apos;, and it turns into a different story... a VERY different kind of story, and it is one that left me confused at first, left adrift, and only Park&apos;s direction kept me afloat. As Part 2 went on I got into the movie more, though you have to be prepared for scenes from part 1 being repeated - and whether this becomes tedious will vary depending on the viewer. Nothing is ever not gorgeous to look at, and Park is inspired by paintings and art in the real world, and it&apos;s completely sumptuous (I&apos;d be rooting for this to win all the costume/production design awards come February), but there comes a point where the filmmakers are showing the &apos;here&apos;s what happened this scene&apos; moments a little too much. I won&apos;t reveal why this is done except to say that the characters take on other roles we didn&apos;t expect, and their decisions and how they hide parts of their personalities makes for fascinating viewing. Some times.

And then it gets to part 3, and the movie goes into being sordid melodrama and not much more. By this time, the filmmakers have to wrap the story up, and show what this man who has been trying to machinate everything for his own ends is met with a nasty fate. Overall there&apos;s so much about The Handmaiden to admire, from the performances by Min-hee Kim as Lady Hideko (appearing in part 1 as varieties of cold and distant and then close and warm and terrified in the other parts), Tae-ri Kim (Sookie, who has much to learn about the art of performance, I mean her character not the actress, she&apos;s great), and Jung-woo Ha as the &apos;Count&apos; who has to remain in control for the whole runtime, but gives in to his passions too. And yet I also wonder if a first viewing trying to explain everything how I felt doesn&apos;t do the film justice: it moves slower and more languidly than other Park films, so it took longer to get in to, and the themes of conning and performance may be done stronger in any given Quentin Tarantino film (though here done with more taste and intense sexuality - i.e. the scene with the thimball on the tooth).

Another viewing may give more, or less. I can tell you now it&apos;s worth seeing if you love pure CINEMA, the likes of which get made by directors with a passion for the form and expressing stories of early 20th century sexual excess and emotional f***ed-up ness (it is early 20th century Korea with a major Japanese influence - in that way it&apos;d make a solid double feature with Kim Jee-Woon&apos;s Age of Shadows). As for whether it&apos;s a great film, I&apos;m not so sure.",8,"['Drama', 'Romance', 'Thriller']","['lesbianism', 'female nudity', 'lesbian sex', 'repeated scene from a different perspective', 'erotic book']",2016-06-01,['Park Chan-wook'],"['Kim Min-hee', 'Ha Jung-woo', 'Cho Jin-woong']","['Sarah Waters', 'Chung Seo-kyung', 'Park Chan-wook']"

Happy Gilmore,A rejected hockey player puts his skills to the golf course to save his grandmother&apos;s house.,Adam Sandler may not be the all-round actor who can deliver many different comic performances but he does have a certain comic style. Happy Gilmore is a failed Hockey player who cannot skate and has a lack of any self-discipline. His life seems to be a complete failure until he finds out he can hit a golf ball over 400 yards. At first you might feel little empathy for Happy as he obviously deserves all the bad luck he gets from the way he treats his friends. But the introduction of Shooter to the screen suddenly makes you root for the underdog. The plot is thrown together to get the most out of Sandler and his antics on screen. Some of the scenes are totally unbelievable particularly when a car is driven on to the golf course to run down Happy! But no matter how many times I see the film it can still make me laugh.,,"['Comedy', 'Sport']","['golf', 'golf course', 'anger', 'alligator', 'rivalry']",1996-02-16,['Dennis Dugan'],"['Adam Sandler', 'Christopher McDonald', 'Julie Bowen']","['Tim Herlihy', 'Adam Sandler']"

Sydney,Professional gambler Sydney teaches John the tricks of the trade. John does well until he falls for cocktail waitress Clementine.,"Sydney is an old gambler who shows kindness to a man he meets outside a diner. He helps out John by lending him £50 and then teaching him enough about gambling to make his way. Two years later finds John loyally sticking with John and adoring him. However, their relationship is put under pressure when John hooks up with Clementine, a cocktail waitress who also turns tricks and Jimmy, a low life with no respect for Sydney.

Although it was pretty badly treated in the UK and mostly ignored and overlooked, the success of Anderson&apos;s films since has given many a reason to look back on Hard Eight (the much better but less meaningful title given it for the UK release) and `discover&apos; it. It certainly is an impressive film and it is difficult to see why it received neither financial or critic success when it was released. The plot is deceptive - starting as a character piece, changing violently with a series of twists and then reverting back to the character piece we started with.

The film is totally driven by it&apos;s characters and they are very well written to the point that we care about them even before we really know all about them. The title `Sydney&apos; is more meaningful simply because the film is pretty much all about Sydney himself. He is a kind man and we wonder why but are gradually won over his gentle nature. This makes the second half of the film more thrilling simply because we think we know Sydney but then he has to do things we think are not in him. Anderson directs with a remarkable assurance; he has style and a real sense of framing. He mixes close ups with wider shots using the fluorescent lighting of the gambling joints to good effect - his direction is as good here as it was in his other, more acclaimed films.

The main thing that makes this film so good though, is the cast. Hall is excellent; I cannot stress how good he is here - his character is well written but it is Hall that makes it work so well with a performance that is subtle and controlled. Reilly is a great character actor and he does the same here with a hangdog expression and put upon attitude. Paltrow is very good for someone whom people seem to have forgotten can actually act. Her Clementine is more complex that first appears. However despite her good work, I think that Paltrow&apos;s limited screen time actually helps the film - she is not the focus here. Jackson is his usual cool self and turns in a memorable performance while Anderson even has a part for Hoffman.

I can imagine some people will not like this film: it is talky for long sections and it ends with questions to be answered - this may frustrate some people but for me I felt it allowed me to think for myself and use what I had learnt about Sydney. This is a surprisingly mature film from such a young director and one that you owe it to yourself to undercover in retrospect.",,"['Crime', 'Drama']","['mentor protege relationship', 'kindness', 'dark past', 'prostitute', 'professional gambler']",1997-02-28,['Paul Thomas Anderson'],"['Philip Baker Hall', 'John C.

Hardcore Henry,"Henry is resurrected from death with no memory, and he must save his wife from a telekinetic warlord with a plan to bio-engineer soldiers.","When is a movie not a movie? How do you rate a movie like this anyway?

Hardcore Henry completely reinvents cinematic language. It&apos;s closer to a videogame in streamlined story and brutal, flinch-inducing violence. The sometimes low-res, often choppy POV is ballsy and cleverly conceived, gags and smart editing is commendable, the director&apos;s well-honed eye providing a true cinematic breath of fresh air.

It has superbly apt, moody music and good directional sound, it&apos;s not nearly as cheap as the marketing led me to believe even though it&apos;s clearly on a shoestring, its inventiveness and good blend of stunt performers and FX create a non-nauseous, toe-curling adrenaline rush.

There&apos;s admiration to be found in the lack of exposition in the 8-bit paper-thin plot and the gaudy, gonzo characters of a suitable Sharlto Copley. If you&apos;re in to videogames or appreciate something different, then Hardcore Henry is a revelatory, avant-garde, art-house action flick with its tongue in its cheek and its balls to the wall. It&apos;s also a sadistic, nihilistic over the top collection of video game levels. Insanely creative and in incredibly bad taste. It&apos;s a gory riot, blackly comic and tells you exactly what it is upfront and never lets up. Many parts of this film are stupid, ugly, dragging and plain insufferable and then there&apos;s equal parts hilarity and visual wit, true kineticism and sheer stuntman balls.

Very Russian. Not for everyone. And wears thin by the end, but very much a one of a kind and relentlessly intent on being it&apos;s own beast. And it helps that the ending is so absurdly laugh-out-loud OTT that it puts Crank to shame.",8,"['Action', 'Adventure', 'Sci-Fi']","['point of view', 'cyborg', 'violence', 'telekinesis', 'moscow russia']",2016-04-08,['Ilya Naishuller'],"['Sharlto Copley', 'Tim Roth', 'Haley Bennett']","['Ilya Naishuller', 'Will Stewart']"
Harold and Maude,"Young, rich, and obsessed with death, Harold finds himself changed forever when he meets lively septuagenarian Maude at a funeral.","Surprisingly hilarious and strange story about living life to the fullest. This film was really well made and the soundtrack for the film was also amazing. I really enjoyed watching it, it was fun to watch.

Ruth Gordon really had a great and touching performance in the film as Maude, an old woman who loves life and the earth. I also thought Bud Cort was surprisingly charming as well in the film as Harold, a young man who is very much so obsessed with death. I think the clashing of the two works very well and they actually have great chemistry together. Whenever it was their time to shine they both absolutely rocked their scenes. I thought in the end it was actually a touching, yet heartbreaking film. It&apos;s a perfect example of opposites attract.

Overall, Harold and Maude was a great film. Definitely gave me similar vibes to The Graduate. Nevertheless, the characters, storytelling, camera work, shot composition, cinematography and acting were all great. I recommend checking it out tbh. There are a lot of good messages in the film.

Haunter,A teenager is stuck in a time loop that is not quite the same each time. She must uncover the truth but her actions have consequences for herself and others.,"Haunter is a ghost story with a twist. The film is based on the interesting concept of a family who lives the same day all over again. This idea is cleverly used in the first part of the movie and efficiently captivates the audience within the first few minutes, The problem is that it quickly gets repetitive. The film has a complex and interesting plot, but is too long to remain truly interesting. Despite a great try for being different from all the other ghost films, Haunter fails at his most important task, being scary. There are a few jumpy scenes, but nothing that should get you hiding under your seat.

In the end, Haunter is another ghost story...not a bad one. Those who enjoy the ghost genre should really check it out. The presence of Abigail Breslin (Zombieland, Little Miss Sunshine) is interesting, but I found the mum and the dad to be the true great actors in that film (the dad played in Saw VI and Silent Hill Revelations 3D). Considering that the director, Vincenzo Natali, is the one responsible for both Cube and Splice, two awesome horror/sci-fi flicks, I think this one is a little bit disappointing.",6,"['Fantasy', 'Horror', 'Mystery']","['time loop', 'house', 'ghost', 'tied feet', 'teenager']",2013-10-17,['Vincenzo Natali'],"['Abigail Breslin', 'Peter Outerbridge', 'Michelle Nolden']",['Brian King']

First, I was expecting lots from this movie, now that I&apos;m more used to Argentinian&apos;s films. But oh my God... this 80 (sufferable) minutes wasn&apos;t on my expectations. 

The story & the way it is shot, yes, is beautiful and completely interesting, and some people will say that the slow pace is necessary...

(as in La Ciénaga & La Niña Santa) and usually (apparently) nothing happens, BUT everything is happening, right there in front of you. 

Well, in this one, apparently nothing happens, and actually... NOTHING is happening. 

And all that technical things, like using that kind of lenses and that focus, (that&apos;s the only way to show what the character is feeling/thinking?? Don&apos;t think so!) and cutting the character&apos;s head all the time... Well, there is a moment when enough is definitely, enough.

Bored me to the core, HATE WHEN PEOPLE DO FILMS FOR THEMSELVES BUT NOT SO INTERESTING FILMS FOR OTHER PEOPLE TO SEE.

The plot (apparently) was interesting, and (again I repeat) she knows how to shoot and camera movements are beautiful, but come on!! Tell me this story in 40 minutes not in 80!!

Overall this was quite the disappointing effort. One of the film&apos;s few good points centers on the titular vehicle and the eerie, ominous air that really works effectively in this sort of effort, as not only is the moments where it appears quite impressive but also manages some decent moments here. The early scenes of the car appearing only for it to be unresponsive to her yelling at it before driving off makes for quite effective build-ups to the centerpiece sequence of it abducting her and dropping her off at the funeral which is quite chilling in concept before the disturbing idea of whether it&apos;s a dream or not as this one isn&apos;t clear wither way which makes it work. Likewise, the film really works in the final half when it finally lets itself go and features a lot to like from a tense chase through the house and eventually into the car chase in the finale all coming together quite well which really works for this one. That&apos;s about all that really works here for this one as there&apos;s a few rather challenging parts to hold this down. The main factor here is the fact that there&apos;s hardly any action whatsoever in the first half here which really makes the first half incredibly tough to get into. Consisting mainly of drawn-out and lame scenes around the town, a rather trite and lame romance and endless scenes of her around the house slowly succumbing to the presence in the house, all of which is insanely dull and just not that interesting. Scenes of her arguing with a lawyer trying to settle an accounting error in the estate, trying to secure a local handyman or just generally being harassed for living there don&apos;t make for all that exciting times which is basically all that&apos;s featured here. There&apos;s a few small haunting thrown in to confuse this as a horror film, yet none of them last nearly as long as the seemingly endless and overlong drama scenes that don&apos;t do much of anything for the pace or storyline here. The other big flaw here is the fact that there&apos;s hardly any motivation for the romance which tends to come in from out of nowhere and further bog down the pacing here with some really tired and lame scenes that don&apos;t have any real impact on the film itself. These here are the film&apos;s big problems which hold it down quite heavily.

Hell Bent for Leather,"Mistaken for a murderous outlaw, an innocent passerby is forced to go on the run to try and clear his name by catching the real culprit.","In Hell Bent For Leather Audie Murphy has the misfortune of running into Jan Merlin on the trail who robs him of his horse. Merlin is a man on the run and known to carry a distinctive shotgun as his weapon of choice. Murphy wounds Merlin fleeing and Merlin drops said shotgun with some fancy carving on the stock.

Which is enough to give the townspeople the idea he&apos;s Merlin. That&apos;s further reinforced by Stephen McNally who represents the law on Merlin&apos;s trail.

But McNally is tired of chasing Merlin. Since he is the only one who really knows Merlin and he&apos;s tired of chasing him, McNally is willing to take credit using Murphy, preferably dead and get credit for stopping the outlaw killer.

Hell Bent For Leather is a lot like another classic western where McNally is the pursued instead of the pursuer Winchester 73. This film is tightly edited and the tale well told, not a minute of footage is wasted. Note also good performances from Felicia Farr as the woman who by circumstance becomes Murphy&apos;s hostage and then ally. And another from Robert Middleton as an old outlaw, not the most noble of characters but one with his own ethics.

The Hellions themselves had great potential and really looked quite cool. The movie eschewed normality for quite a surreal atmosphere and visual palette, there was also some cool original music which was creepy. It all got very confusing however between what was dream, reality, supernatural or whatever. By the end I didn&apos;t really care anymore as the narrative was lost due to me being confused generally.

The original Hellraiser was like an exciting and very creative visual unfolding of hell. It SHOWED you the journey instead of telling you. It took place inside a good man&apos;s home who had a loving and strong relationship with his daughter. It made us care and relate.

It made you feel like you were inside its hellish world.

The reboot is like someone overly talking and explaining Hellraiser to you until you become bored and don&apos;t even care anymore. It takes place in many locations around a lazy junkie type girl who we don&apos;t care about.

This one makes you feel like an outsider just hearing about its world.

Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth,An investigative reporter must send the newly unbound Pinhead and his legions back to Hell.,"For being a horror-loving maniac, I hate to say I had not seen either of the Hellraiser movies until recently. I was born in 84, so I definitely had time to catch this one. My mother suggested I rent the first movie one night b/c I was searching for a bloody, scary, sickening movie...yes, I love those the best. So I picked it up...and, suffice to say, I thought was good and went and got part II, III, and IV. I should say, no movie I have seen has had such gore...well, besides brief moments in EVENT HORIZON (my fav movie of all time...maybe) Doug Bradley makes Pinhead almost loveable. For me at least. I find I hate him at points, but love him at others...maybe it&apos;s my fascination with the underworld. He has a unique look, as well as the other cenobytes. Out of the series (haven&apos;t seen part V yet....still on the one-night shelves) this one (III) is most definitely my favorite. The humor is great. Pinhead is in it enough to satisfy me...whereas he was not in the previous ones. Pinhead makes even the ugliest depths of hell look beautiful. Of course, being a gore and hell fanatic...maybe it&apos;s just myself. I would love to meet Clive and Doug and see how it really was to make these films. To me, they are brilliant and amazing.

Ying xiong,"A defense officer, Nameless, was summoned by the King of Qin regarding his success of terminating three warriors.","Rarely have I been so astounded by such a magnificent, awe-inspiring film. If you have not yet placed your eyes on this masterpiece of Chinese cinema then I cannot recommend this film highly enough. &apos;Hero&apos; is by far the best Chinese film I have ever seen, and already a firm favourite of all time.

The imagery is unparallelled, simply draw-droppingly near perfect scenes, with bold and vibrant use of colour, symbolism and scenery. The fluent flow of the storyline, the delicate direction of the sword slicing action, the Chinese cultural concepts and the emotionally charged scenes between characters combine to produce a simply remarkable achievement. 

This film has a few elements from Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, but is far, far superior in every way. The sleek direction from Yimou Zhang is so perfectly done, just imagine two martial arts experts ensuing in battle against each other, defying the laws of physics as we know it, and yet following them in 360 degrees in slow motion as one deflects a droplet of rain from one sword to the other, at the same time spinning and leaping over water... simply beautiful. The attack sequences are also superbly set, with hundreds of thousands of the King&apos;s warriors in formation, simultaneously firing enough arrows into the city which literally cover the sky, in addition to the viewer being able to watch the journey of a single arrowhead aimed during this event. The build up to the attack along with the unnerving tune of a Chinese stringed instrument help you, as the audience, to become firmly engrossed in your seat. 

The individual martial arts is also second to none, for myself particularly to see the distant shots of the whole battle sequence showing the true skills involved with fighting, such as footwork, perfect timing,aggression, counter attacks and defence. Jet Li shows he is truly the grand daddy of martial arts. I cannot stress enough how much you need this film in your life. 

The colourful imagery imposed by the director will take your breath away with luscious, vivid, bright, wind-blown,draped backgrounds as the setting for the important progression of the story. Even the story itself is brought to the audience in such a way which ensures your undivided attention, as there are twists in the tales and hidden plots which do not develop until the end of the film.Even short individual scenes are memorable due to their sheer awesome display of skill and speed. 

This film even holds a political message which is relevant to all times, especially in today&apos;s American-lead world dominance. This film has absolutely everything - including an extremely sexy young Ziyi Zhang who simply is the biggest hype to come out of china since SARS. 

This film was released in 2002, but this is certainly one of my all time favourites and will probably be the best film I see all year. I have never been more enthusiastic to pursue films in this genre in my life. For more action type enthusiasts who like more gore and violence check out &apos;Ong Bak&apos;, but for people who appreciate a fuller, visionary piece of martial arts filming, this will leave you speechless.",10,"['Action', 'Adventure', 'Drama']","['3rd century b.c.', 'assassin', 'ancient china', 'wuxia', 'warrioress']",2004-08-27,['Yimou Zhang'],"['Jet Li', 'Tony Leung Chiu-wai', 'Maggie Cheung']","['Feng Li', 'Yimou Zhang', 'Bin Wang']"

The Heroes of Telemark,Norwegian resistance tries to stop German efforts to produce an atomic bomb component during World War II.,"Throughout the 1960s, Hollywood invented what we now call &apos;infiltration commando films&apos;, a truly interesting sub-genre within war films, far from the brutal realism that would be introduced years later, but with enough adventure and romanticism to be regarded as a great spectacle. Until then, war films were characterized by a minimalist way of developing the theme, showing the audience small brush strokes of war. Although there were war scenes, directors focused more on directing the actors than on special effects and creating a spectacular story. Great films such as &apos;Objective, Burma!&apos; (1945), &apos;Destination Tokyo&apos; (1943) and &apos;The Bridge on the River Kwai&apos; (1957) included no important action scenes. They started to appear later on thanks to the demythologization of war, and the will to recover a genre that had been more or less forgotten. &apos;The Guns of Navarone&apos; (1961), &apos;The Dirty Dozen&apos; (1967) and &apos;Where Eagles Dare&apos; (1968) are good examples of this commando sub-genre. They were keen to show a more feasible type of war, slightly unreal and &apos;festive&apos;, but without losing their ensemble film quality.

Together with the three mentioned above, one of the most popular films is &apos;The Heroes of Telemark&apos;, directed by the brilliant Anthony Mann, a great director of western and ensemble films, who lived in Europe back then and worked in Samuel Bronston&apos;s blockbusters. Using his savor-fare in &apos;The Heroes of Telemark&apos; he adapted a true story that took place during Germany&apos;s invasion of Norway. He worked together with screenwriters Ivan Moffat, Knut Haukelid and Ben Barzman (with the support of novelist John Drummond) and the magnetism of Kirk Douglas, Richard Harris, Ulla Jacobsson and Sir Michael Redgrave. We must not forget the excellent photography of Robert Krasker, which transports us to Telemark (Norway) in the comfort of our seats, and also the elegant score by Malcolm Arnold (who also composed the music for &apos;The Bridge on the River Kwai&apos;). Curiously enough, Kirk Douglas worked with Anthony Mann again when he started to direct &apos;Spartacus&apos; (1960), before he was replaced by Stanley Kubrick.

The film is set in the region of Telemark (Norway) in 1942, when the allies found a document that irrefutably proved that German scientists were making progress in the search for atomic fission at the Vemork heavy water plant, situated next to the small town of Rjukan, and were in the middle of making an atomic bomb that would change the course of the war. &apos;Heavy water&apos; is a chemical compound with a molecular formula equivalent to water, in which hydrogen atoms are replaced with deuterium, a heavy hydrogen isotope.

Back then, Norway had built up its own resistance, made up of civilians and former soldiers. One of the members, Knut Haukelid (1911-1994), twin brother of actress Sigrid Gurie, became a national hero after being part of the real commando that appears in the film. The Norwegian resistance and the British army work against the clock to prevent Hitler from achieving his long-awaited bomb: Together they draw up an ambitious plan to destroy the Vemork factory. Once they rule out the possibility of bombarding, Operation Freshman is launched – British paratroopers are deployed over Telemark and are supposed to join the resistance, led by the Norwegian soldier Knut Straud (Richard Harris), who does not hesitate to seek the help of physicist Rolf Pedersen (Kirk Douglas). To make it all even more dramatic, Pedersen discovers that his ex-wife (Ulla Jacobsson) and uncle (Sir Michael Redgrave) have joined the resistance. This is dangerous for him personally because one&apos;s feelings can often cloud one&apos;s reasoning in times of war. The human reactions that take place in the film help to establish a stronger connection between the audience and the protagonists.

Operation Freshman proves to be unsuccessful because the Horsa Glidier gliders crash and part of the crew die in the accident, and the rest are shot by the enemy. A great part of the true story emerges in the film, although the name of Major Knut Haukelid is changed to Knut Straud (Richard Harris), in order to allow certain liberties in the development of the film. After the first mission fails, the Norwegian commando that is waiting, made up of 15 volunteers (in the film there are only 9), launches Operation Gunnerside. They enter the factory and destroy the tanks where the &apos;heavy water&apos; is stored. The facility remains inactive for two months but the Germans manage to rebuild the tanks and increase production. The saboteurs ski all the way to Sweden to avoid being captured by the Germans, while the Norwegian and British soldiers continue to rack their brains to find a way to stop the production of &apos;heavy water&apos;. These events pick up speed in the film and shortly after the first attempt to sabotage the factory, Kirk Douglas and Richard Harris (after a thrilling persecution on skis) come into action again and plan to blow up the factory which is about to transport the &apos;heavy water&apos;, even if they have to risk their lives and those of their loved ones to complete the mission.

For just over two hours, and thanks to the rhythm and elegance that Anthony Mann stamps in every shot, the audience will travel alongside the protagonists, in their adventures and mishaps, and will discover a truly interesting series of historical events. The filming locations were Vemork, Rjukan, Tinnsjo and Gausta, in the region of Telemark, in Norway, and also Oslo, because Anthony Mann wanted to make the most of the beautiful landscape. While he was there, he shot magnificent skiing scenes, in the manner of the best German Bergfilms. We must not forget that the region of Telemark is the cradle of skiing, as it is known today.",8,"['Action', 'Drama', 'History']","['nazi occupation', 'heavy water', 'norwegian resistance', 'sabotage', 'reference to j. robert oppenheimer']",1965-12-03,['Anthony Mann'],"['Kirk Douglas', 'Richard Harris', 'Ulla Jacobsson']","['Ivan Moffat', 'Ben Barzman', 'Harold Pinter']"

Tengoku to jigoku,An executive of a Yokohama shoe company becomes a victim of extortion when his chauffeur&apos;s son is kidnapped by mistake and held for ransom.,"Kingo Gondo is a wealthy executive at the National Shoes company in Yokohama. He aims to make affordable, sturdy footwear for the masses. His co-workers opt instead for those of the cheap, low-quality variety that will wear easily, meaning they will need to be replaced often. In secret, Gondo organizes a leveraged buyout of the company, mortgaging all he has to afford it. However, just before he makes the deal, the son of his chauffeur is kidnapped and held for ransom. It&apos;s clear the kidnappers intended to kidnap Gondo&apos;s child, and he feels just as responsible as if they had. Will the police- led by the capable Inspector Tokura- be able to find the child and solve the extortion plot before it&apos;s too late?

Loosely based on Ed McBain&apos;s novel &apos;King&apos;s Ransom,&apos; Akira Kurosawa&apos;s &apos;High and Low&apos; is a powerful police procedural that will keep viewers&apos; attentions held rapt from start to finish. With a screenplay by Kurosawa, Hideo Oguni, Ryûzô Kikushima and Eijirô Hisaita, the film examines many themes in an eloquent manner, including those of honor and morality. It also paints a picture of then-contemporary Yokohama as a city built upon an endemic inequality between the classes, and shows how easily the disenfranchised and impecunious can fall into a life of crime.

&apos;High and Low&apos; is a tense thriller that feels most authentic. Kurosawa shows us with precision the minutia that the police engage in, how they build their case and begin scavenging the city for clues to the kidnapping. Slowly, but steadily, headway is made, and Kurosawa doesn&apos;t rush the procedural process of the investigation. This is not to say the film is in any way slow-moving or drawn out, because the opposite is the case: &apos;High and Low&apos; rockets along at a brisk pace, feeling all too short at 143 minutes; if anything.

The film reunites Kurosawa with cinematographers Asakazu Nakai and Takao Saitô, whose camera-work and shot construction is mightily impressive. &apos;High and Low&apos; has an assured visual style, and the utilization of shadows is most striking. There is one instance of color being used in the film, which is to great effect; while the remainder of the black and white cinematography is rich and textured. Though he made some beautiful looking pictures in his time, the naturalism and style with which &apos;High and Low&apos; is captured makes it a standout in Kurosawa&apos;s filmography.

As do the terrific, power-house performances from his cast. His second-to-last collaboration with the incomparable Toshirô Mifune, here his original muse stars as Gondo, giving a masterful performance of much restraint. Mifune creates in Gondo an initially fastidious character, whose evolution over the course of the film feels both authentic and subtle. Often, when one thinks of Kurosawa and Mifune, the Samurai pictures spring first to mind; though their work together here is just as impactful and entertaining as any of those earlier films.

Co-starring as Inspector Tokura is Kurosawa&apos;s second muse, the great Tatsuya Nakadai. Always a commanding presence on screen, he plays Tokura as a charming, determined detective who will do anything to catch his man. Though he has less emotional volubility to exhibit in the role, Nakadai performs just as strongly as Mifune; and neither man overshadows the other. Additionally, in a small but pivotal role stars Tsutomu Yamazaki, who showcases much depth and range, leaving a lasting impression on the viewer.

Thrilling from beginning to end, Akira Kurosawa&apos;s &apos;High and Low&apos; is a brilliant piece of film noir, featuring an interesting examination of class at its center. Boasting stunning cinematography, as well as strong performances from all in the cast, there is little fault one can find with it. If you haven&apos;t seen it before, and you&apos;re a fan of police procedurals, they look no further: for &apos;High and Low&apos; is a masterpiece of the genre.",9,"['Crime', 'Drama', 'Mystery']","['drug overdose', 'class differences', 'house on a hill', 'detective', 'rich man']",1963-11-26,['Akira Kurosawa'],"['Toshirô Mifune', 'Yutaka Sada', 'Tatsuya Nakadai']","['Hideo Oguni', 'Ryûzô Kikushima', 'Eijirô Hisaita']"
High Fidelity,"Rob, a record store owner and compulsive list maker, recounts his top five breakups, including the one in progress.","John Cusack is the star, and one of the screenwriters and co-producers, of this likeable adaptation of the Nick Hornby novel. At its core, it capably tells a good romantic story, and does a very amusing job at poking fun at people who lord their supposedly superior musical knowledge (and tastes) over others. It&apos;s got an attractive and endearing cast, and it naturally also has a non-stop, eclectic soundtrack.

Cusack plays Rob, the neurotic owner of a record store that is far from prosperous. His employees are the timid Dick (Todd Louiso) and the far more brash Barry (Jack Black, who walks away with the film). After his longtime girlfriend Laura (charming Danish actress Iben Hjejle) dumps him for another man, it forces him to take stock and reflect on the major relationships - and break-ups - of his life.

Cusack is typically engaging, although this viewer could have done without that over-used device of having the main character directly address the camera. The film itself, despite being a little overlong, has some good laughs. I cracked up when Rob fantasized possible reactions to the annoying Ian (an amusing Tim Robbins), including a scenario of him, Barry, and Dick beating the almighty hell out of him.

Some intelligent and pointed dialogue is brought to life by this talented cast, with a steady parade of lovely ladies (Lisa Bonet, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Lili Taylor, Joelle Carter) as the women who have caught Robs&apos; eyes over the years. Rob himself is not too sympathetic for much of the running time, but then, that is the whole point as it takes a while to pinpoint himself as a common denominator, and have his eventual epiphany.

Nice cameo by rock star Bruce Springsteen, too.

Lo chiamavano King,A bounty hunter tracks a vicious gang of gunrunners across the border into Mexico.,"I&apos;m a spaghetti western fanatic, enough so that even lesser efforts in the genre entertain me. However, with this particular spaghetti western I find it hard to generate much enthusiasm, so I can only imagine what a non-fanatic might think of this movie. It has a somewhat confusing plot, with characters doing things that often seem murky. Harrison&apos;s character is an unexceptional hero, and several times is off-screen for long periods of time. Kinski&apos;s character ends up being bizarre due to Kinski acting completely different from what his character says or does at the same time. That does give the movie some moments of (unintended) humor. The movie does have some good action sequences and has a good musical score, especially the title song, which is one of the best ever composed for a spaghetti western. But in the end, you&apos;ll forget most of the movie not long after watching it, so I would only recommend it if you are really into Euro westerns (and Klaus Kinski).",,['Western'],"['vengeance', 'rape', 'spaghetti western', 'italo western', 'rape and revenge']",1971-05-18,['Giancarlo Romitelli'],"['Richard Harrison', 'Anne Puskin', 'Goffredo Unger']",['Renato Savino']
The Hitcher,A young man who escapes the clutches of a murderous hitchhiker is subsequently stalked by the hitcher and framed for his crimes.,"Yes, this movie would be remade years later with Sean Bean cast as the hitchhiker that likes to play some rather brutal games and one has to wonder why. Rutger Hauer was perfectly cast here as the psycho and his performance could not have been topped. Maybe they felt the need for a female lead rather than the male one because you know how females never get the chance to be the main character who survives in a horror movie (heavy sarcasm here). This is basically a story of a young man driving in the middle of nowhere who looks to have been very bored and in the need of some company. He finds some in the form of a hitchhiker and suffice to say he should have listened to all the warnings he got of hitchhikers, but on the plus side his travels in the middle of nowhere are about to be a lot less dull. You get a great scene as the two opponents as it were square off for the first time with the young man seemingly getting the better of the hitcher in round one. Unfortunately, everyone in this desert seems to be to kind for their own good as the guy sees the psycho in a car with a family. So other face-offs with this hitcher are coming up and some will be very violent indeed. A rather good thriller/horror type movie with my main complaint coming towards the end as how was he not handled better than that? Other than that you get a very good and chilling game of cat and mouse and you get a performance by Hauer that could not have possibly been beat.",8,"['Action', 'Mystery', 'Thriller']","['hitchhiker', 'road movie', 'evil man', 'serial killer', 'mysterious villain']",1986-02-21,['Robert Harmon'],"['Rutger Hauer', 'C.

The film has no specific genre, it&apos;s a jumble of ideas. And I like that. 

The acting is fantastic all round, At the start it was strange hearing Daniel Radcliffe speaking in an American accent but he does it brilliantly and his performance all the way through is just brilliant. There isn&apos;t a single character in the film who isn&apos;t 100% believable and vital to the story.

Visually, the film is also terrific. I could watch the whole thing on mute and still enjoy it hugely.

Horror Island,A down-on-his-luck businessman organizes an excursion to Sir Henry Morgan&apos;s Island for a treasure hunt only to encounter a mysterious phantom and murder.,"I had first known about this through a still in the Halliwell Film Guide, though the noted late critic usually dismissed similar programmers: it turned out to be a fun horror comedy (from a story by Curt Siodmak) whose 60-minute length zips by  providing plenty of characters (even if the gangster-on-the-lam and his moll don&apos;t really work here), action, old-fashioned thrills (a caped maniac after hidden loot is loose in a remote castle), chuckles  and a surprise villain; the film is a shade overbalanced by the comedy, but the typical Universal atmosphere (and a few of its more notable sets!) are certainly present throughout. It also features a good second-tier cast: likable Dick Foran and cute Peggy Moran  re-united after the superior THE MUMMY&apos;S HAND (1940)  are the leads and they&apos;re ably supported by the likes of Leo Carrillo, Fuzzy Knight, Hobart Cavanaugh and Walter Catlett; however, it&apos;s Lewis Howard who steals the film as Moran&apos;s chronically tired companion  even though he&apos;s absent through most of the second half! 

Michael Elliott had rated this a *** and I almost did myself  but, in the long run, I don&apos;t think the film has quite the same draw as even some of the lesser titles in the Universal monster cycle; still, for an &apos;old dark house&apos; type of film  of which the studio did their fair share  it&apos;s well up to par. Incidentally, I had acquired another copy of this on DVD-R last year, but the disc froze several times during playback and I had to give up after a while; I&apos;m glad I caught up with it eventually, as the film deserves to have a legitimate DVD release along with some of the other rare/lesser-known Universal horrors, like MAN-MADE MONSTER (1941)  which I&apos;ve never watched!  and NIGHT MONSTER (1942).",6,"['Comedy', 'Crime', 'Mystery']","['map', 'wooden leg', 'heebie jeebies as slang', 'reference to bluebeard', 'reference to shakespeare&apos;s hamlet']",1941-03-28,['George Waggner'],"['Dick Foran', 'Leo Carrillo', 'Peggy Moran']","['Maurice Tombragel', 'Victor McLeod', 'Alex Gottlieb']"

Horrors of War,,"Man, I just don&apos;t know why I keep falling for such movies. Their concepts sounds greatly entertaining and silly enough to expect a good and fun movie from but rarely do this kind of movies ever work out as such.

It&apos;s not hard to say what is the foremost problem with this movie. Thing is that this movie of course has a totally ridicules and far from convincing main premise but yet the movie decides on taking a serious approach with it all. When you have such a low budget and so minimal resources there simply is no way that you can make this movie work out as a serious one. Had they decided on a more entertaining and over-the-top approach the movie would at least had been fun to watch. It now is mostly a boring one that is awfully bad looking.

The movie is a mixture of WW II and horror in which all different kinds of monsters show up. Sounds exciting perhaps but it just really isn&apos;t. The movie gets never tense because it&apos;s all done quite poorly. It&apos;s good and fun and all that the film-makers actually had the resources and the money at hand to make the movie their way but it&apos;s clear that they just aren&apos;t the most talented people around and the fact that the movie is so cheap looking works really distracting from the movie and prevents the story to ever work out. You just never get into this movie or any of its events are characters, that all remain amazingly flat. I really can&apos;t tell who&apos;s who in this movie.

The story is also pretty messy. Things seem to happen pretty randomly and often the story is all over the place. The story makes often sudden jumps as if whole sections of the movie are missing from it. It prevents also the story from really ever flowing well and what it is lacking as well is a main plot line.

Because of the way how cheap the movie is looking, it also often becomes a laughable one, for all of the wrong reasons. I don&apos;t even think the movie intentionally tried to be bad, since as earlier mentioned, the film-makers fully seemed to go along with a full serious style of film-making. The special effects are ridicules and look like something everybody can make on their home computer. The costumes of the soldiers don&apos;t even seem to be authentic looking and lets not even get started on the creature effects.

Horror fans also won&apos;t really enjoy this, not even the ones that enjoy watching bad B-movies. There simply is no excitement, scares, surprises, creative originality or any gore. 

The movie is just one bad looking and badly made bore-fest.

This director seems to get off on the fact that he made the most brutal film ever. Can you explain this to me? Is he actually proud of this movie? He had the nerve to say it will save lives by watching it. I would love for him to elaborate. All I know, when making a movie, especially one that revolves around such a serious matter, you should use some common sense and decency.

The Hours,,"Spoilers herein.

I love what I call &apos;folding&apos; in film, and this is certainly a folded film. Simple folding is when one element of the film creates another and the two lay side by side. Folded.

Meryl Streep was in one of the touchstones of this technique: &apos;The French Lieutenant&apos;s Woman,&apos; which existed as both a story and a film about that story, with Meryl slipping seamlessly between character and actor. At all times, she carried a shadow of the other.

Nicole has come late to folded acting in &apos;Moulin Rouge!&apos; but she understands the demands well. Julianne has always been folded in her approach since the peak of self-referential folding: &apos;Vanya on 42nd Street.&apos; These are three of the four master actresses capable of doing such a thing.

Woolf was &apos;folded&apos; in her writing, shifting between events and self-conscious comment on the events, including implicit perspectives on the creation of both. This is much like Joyce and Nabokov but more mechanically neurotic. Cunningham&apos;s treatment extends that notion and Hare respects the folding.

Here we have one world of the writer, one of the character, and one of the reader. This latter is the novelty, with an almost predictable overlap between the last two in a second, embedded writer. It is an almost perfect construction brought to life by three of the most self-aware actors in history - a folded film about a book (Cunningham&apos;s) about a book (Brown&apos;s) about a book (Woolf&apos;s) about folding. This is a work of art about nothing less than life as art, beings as gods and the angst of that knowledge. Phil Glass&apos;s score is aptly relentless, reflecting hopeless fate.

So what is wrong? What keeps this from being a life-altering experience? The director Daltry, that&apos;s what.

Daldry never passes up a chance to be overtly emotional, falsely dramatic. Where Woolf and Cunningham are subtly rich, Daltry is vulgarly plain. Where these woman cry out for multidimensional expression, Daldry shoves them into one-dimensionality. (I&apos;ll never, ever forgive him for &apos;Billy Elliot.&apos;) Examples: the death of the bird is so sweetly fantastic, what with the ultradarling angel, I thought I was in a Fellini excess. When the aged Laura Brown turns up at Clarissa&apos;s and starts to tear up, we actually HEAR her blink her weepy eyes. When Laura imagines her death we are treated to a vision of rising river water that is completely out of character of the type of nuanced metaphor needed. When someone in one fold cracks an egg, EVERYONE must crack an egg. When Ed Harris does his tortured artist bit, we have every stoke as plain obviousness. And this from a man who has done this precise thing with texture as Pollock! (Incidentally, he&apos;s paid his own dues with folding film in &apos;Truman Show.&apos;)

I cannot pass up an opportunity to comment on the hair. All three of these leads are often redheads, two of them naturally. Toni Collette is as well. In this film, red hair color has been engineered down to Julianne and Toni to match the technique of red-deprived colored film stock copied from &apos;Far From Heaven.&apos; That is, except for the red Eileen Atkins (flowershop lady) who has herself made something of a career out of Virginia Woolf.

House of 1000 Corpses,Two young couples traveling across the backwoods of Texas searching for urban legends of murder end up as prisoners of a bizarre and sadistic backwater family of serial killers.,"Rob Zombie&apos;s House Of 1000 Corpses is a lot to sit through, and at times is a victim of its own overly zany ambition. Nevertheless, it&apos;s the first stepping stone in the path of one of the most fascinating and talented directorial careers in the industry, and is a completely batshit mental curiosity in its own right. Zombie sprung onto the scene with this one and has since been a controversial, much talked about and frequently hated voice of horror. Let&apos;s get one thing transparently clear: No one can be blamed for not enjoying his films, they&apos;re incredibly niche and not everyone&apos;s thing, but you are simply lying to yourself if you won&apos;t concede what a hugely talented writer, director and all round filmmaker he is. I&apos;ve had to get quite stern in conversations with people whose tunnel vision stubbornness supersedes their ability to logically analyze his work, and I simply won&apos;t put up with it. Alright, scolding done, over to the film. I&apos;ll be the first to admit that House is a splattered mess at times and goes about six light years over the top, but the sheer grungy scope of production design is really something to see. In deepest backwoods Americana, the murderous Firefly clan preys on, terrorizes and murders pretty much anyone who gets in their path. Bill Moseley is a Manson-esque dark angel as Otis Driftwood, renegade bad boy brother, Sheri Moon Zombie is like Harley Quinn on bath salts as Baby, who is definitely the scariest, while gargantuan Matthew McGrory, walking decrepitude grandpa (Dennis Fimple) and giggling slutwhore Mama (Karen Black doing her very best freaky Betty Boop rendition) round out the rest of the brood. They live in some cluttered rural dump right out of Hoarders, luring unsuspecting travellers off the road and murdering them in really over elaborate, exhaustive looking ways. Oh and we see the birth of one of cinema&apos;s most jovial and sleazy killer clowns, Sid Haig&apos;s motor mouth Captain Spaulding, who bookends the film in uproariously raunchy comic relief. It&apos;s a neon fever nightmare of relentless commotion, visual excess, metal music, retro Americana pop culture bliss and sadistic gore, Zombie going all out to solidify his storytelling aesthetic that would continue, in augmented, evolved ways, over the course of his brilliant career. This is certainly as obnoxious a film as you&apos;ll find in his stable, and while it ranks in the southern end of my Zombie favourites list, there&apos;s just no ignoring the raucous, depraved celebration of all things gross, gooey and grotesque that parades by. Not to mention the whip-smart, trashy and endlessly funny dialogue, writing being skill that the man excels in on another level.",,['Horror'],"['depravity', 'masked man', 'giant', 'clown face', 'axe']",2003-04-11,['Rob Zombie'],"['Sid Haig', 'Karen Black', 'Bill Moseley']",['Rob Zombie']
Shi mian mai fu,"A romantic police captain breaks a beautiful member of a rebel group out of prison to help her rejoin her fellows, but things are not what they seem.","Shi Mian Mai Fu belongs to a growing body of work that embodies a clearly Asian aesthetic packaged just as clearly for Western consumption. It is no coincidence that, each time I paused the DVD for whatever reason, the still image on the screen was as beautiful as any classic wood block print by Hiroshige or Hokusai. Xiaoding Zhao&apos;s elegant cinematography imbues every scene with haunting beauty. Think Tak Fujimoto times ten, with no disrespect meant to Fujimoto, who shoots Western movies and still manages to inject his refined visual sense into such great films as Silence of the Lambs and Sixth Sense.

Director Yimou Zhang&apos;s work in Hero was more epic, more heroic, but SMMF has a more refined sense of story. The cast, the scenery, the music, including vocal performances by the legendary Kathleen Battle; all elements conspire brilliantly to convey subtle and nuanced meaning in moments. The story, as do all good stories of this genre, revolves around a delicate interplay of love, betrayal, deception and heroism of many different kinds, and, oh yes, those stunning ballets of combat layered with evocative sounds and effects.

In a nutshell, the plot goes something like this. A beautiful blind showgirl is captured as a spy. Her captors conspire to trick her into leading them to her leader. Along the way, both hunter and quarry become entangled in a web of subterfuge and deception. Add in a beautifully tragic romantic story line, again, as all such movies must have, and never forget that the essence of all truly great tragedy is inevitability.

This movie is also known as Ambush From Ten Sides, and in that more literal translation of its title you will find its essence. A worthy successor to Hero, though not as magnificent as Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, in which Ziyi Zhang gives the performance of a lifetime and the one against all her other roles will be judged, and in this case, fall short, House of Flying Daggars is nevertheless a feast for the senses and a fully satisfying cinematic experience.",8,"['Action', 'Adventure', 'Drama']","['snow adventure', 'tang dynasty', 'wuxia', '9th century', 'wuxia fiction']",2005-01-14,['Yimou Zhang'],"['Ziyi Zhang', 'Takeshi Kaneshiro', 'Andy Lau']","['Feng Li', 'Bin Wang', 'Yimou Zhang']"
House of Frankenstein,"A deranged scientist escapes from prison and recruits Dracula, Frankenstein&apos;s monster and the Wolf Man to get revenge on his behalf.","House of Frankenstein was the first of the monster free for alls with all three Universal monster legends, the Frankenstein monster, the wolfman, and Dracula. It is not the most coherent story around, but you won&apos;t care because the film has a brisk pace, imaginative scenes, creative sets, and some first-rate acting. Boris Karloff plays a doctor in the Dr. Frankenstein tradition trying to resurrect the Monster and appease the wolfman by finding him a path to death. He is the epitome of evil and has no moral compass whatsoever. Karloff does a fine job in his role, and Lon Chaney, as ever saddened at his lunar plight, does a wonderful job again as Larry Talbot(his third time in the role). Glenn Strange plays the monster..and plays him well although really has little to do in the film till the last five minutes. Dracula is played by John Carradine. The shining stars of the cast, however, are J. Carroll Naish playing a poor murdering hunchback with low self-esteem, and the bubbly and beautiful Elena Verdugo as a gypsy girl. Naish gives a very poignant portrayal. Look for cameos by Lionel Atwill and George Zucco(wish his part had been larger). House of Frankenstein is a great film in the Universal tradition of its monsters and mayhem.

House of Usher,"Upon entering his fiancée&apos;s family mansion, a man discovers a savage family curse and fears that his future brother-in-law has entombed his bride-to-be prematurely.","House of Usher is the first Edgar Allan Poe adaptation in a series (seven, to be exact) directed by Roger Corman, and probably my number one recommendation if you&apos;re looking for a good old-fashioned spooky tale. Corman merely lays the stress on the comedy-factor in his later efforts, but House of Usher still has the ability to frighten the bejezus out of you through a complex plot, a nightmarish atmosphere and horrific decors. The screenplay is very loyal to Poe&apos;s tale of the UshersTwo remaining siblings, cursed and constantly punished for the evil of their criminal ancestors. Price is brilliant as usual in his role of the over-concerned Roderick Usher, convinced that his fade is sealed and his remaining days are doomed. Multiple memorable highlights in this film, like for example a ghoulish dream-sequence, a breath taking decent in the family vault and a truly petrifying act of vengeance!

House of Wax,A group of teens are unwittingly stranded near a strange wax museum and soon must fight to survive and keep from becoming the next exhibit.,"House Of Wax is pretty much everything I like in a horror movie.

Carly Jones (Elisha Cuthbert) and her boyfriend, Wade (Jared Padalecki) are going to the big college football game with a group of friends and her brother, Nick (Chad Michael Murray). Along the way, they get tired and look for a place to camp out for awhile and get some rest. As you can imagine, car problems end up keeping them from getting out of their hidden campsite. Carly and Wade head for the small town of Ambrose, which seems strange on the surface.

This is where the real action begins. While I admit that the movie took it&apos;s time getting to the good stuff, it was well worth the wait. The special effects department have outdone themselves. Especially when it comes to the house made of wax, itself.

I was very surprised by the low rating given by the IMDb users. I should not be, but I was. Do not be fooled. If you are into horror movies, then this one comes highly recommended. In fact, it has inspired me to see the original and will do so first chance I get. 8/10",,"['Horror', 'Thriller']","['wax', 'brother sister relationship', 'group of friends', 'masked killer', 'beaten to death']",2005-05-06,['Jaume Collet-Serra'],"['Chad Michael Murray', 'Paris Hilton', 'Elisha Cuthbert']","['Charles Belden', 'Chad Hayes', 'Carey W.

How the Grinch Stole Christmas,"On the outskirts of Whoville lives a green, revenge-seeking Grinch who plans to ruin Christmas for all of the citizens of the town.","Howard&apos;s &apos;How the Grinch Stole Christmas&apos; is a delightful family flick that both adults and children can enjoy (mostly with each other). It is basically an adaptation of the famous children&apos;s books and what the audience gets is a pleasant Christmas treat. Price&apos;s screenplay is brilliant as he cleverly manages to include some adult humour.

The world of Whoville is beautifully constructed and created, full of colour, life, energy and spirit. The vivacious characters are full of positive energy and while it is over the top, it is all done within the context and none of it appears out of place. The CGI team and makeup crew deserve full credit for making the characters and settings so lifelike, bringing out a lot of detail and appearing authentic. The set designs are stunning and the cinematography is just as energetic as the characters.

Child actress Taylor Momsen is absolutely. The cute dog also turns in a fine performance. Jeffrey Tambor, a very sexy Christine Baranski, Bill Irwin and Molly Shannon are first rate. However, what would &apos;How the Grinch Stole Christmas&apos; be without Jim Carrey? Carrey is simply fantastic as he immerses himself entirely into the character. It&apos;s a role that has Jim Carrey written all over it. The actor has immortalized the Grinch on screen.

The movie itself is not an exact 100% adaptation of the book as there are a few changes. The romance between the Grinch and Martha May could have been better developed. Other than the actors mentioned above, the rest of the cast hardly have anything to do than make fleeting appearances. Yet, &apos;How the Grinch Stole Christmas&apos; is a charming little Christmas family film that is dazzling to look at and hugely enjoyable with the whole family.",,"['Comedy', 'Family', 'Fantasy']","['christmas', 'dog', 'dr. seuss&apos; how the grinch stole christmas', 'dr seuss', 'monster']",2000-11-17,['Ron Howard'],"['Jim Carrey', 'Taylor Momsen', 'Kelley']","['Dr. Seuss', 'Jeffrey Price', 'Peter S.

The Hurricane,"The story of Rubin &apos;Hurricane&apos; Carter, a boxer wrongly imprisoned for murder, and the people who aided in his fight to prove his innocence.","Framed by a white cop for a murder he didn&apos;t commit, boxer Ruben &apos;Hurricane&apos; Carter tries to free himself from the constrains of his cell mentally by studying, picking over his case and writing his autobiography. Seven years later, Carter is still in prison with appeal after appeal being turned down, but his book has found its way into the hands a young student, Lesra who is inspired to study by the lessons in his book. As the two get to know one another through letters and meetings, Lesra and his teachers devote themselves to getting Carter freedom through a successful appeal.

Despite the fact that the basics of the story is interesting and compelling, this film only manages to be reasonable entertaining rather than compelling because it never really goes deeper than the basics. The story of a man wrongfully imprisoning and yet, somehow, overcoming that is going to be worth a look as it offers enough human interest for me to give it a try, but the problem here is that the film will give you a very basic look at the story and this basic feel will stop you getting involved in the story and maybe even make you wonder how much of it has been simplified down. Enough elements of the film remain interesting to cover this gap though and the character of Carter is interesting and semi-inspiring as he is portrayed here; I say &apos;as portrayed here&apos; because I do not know how real this person I have seen here is. Part of the problem may be Jewison himself as his background is of a time where things could be as simple as, literally, black and white  but he brings that view to this movie and the story (and even the truth) appear to suffer as a result.

In Jewison&apos;s world there is no complex issues, no legal technicalities, no nothing  there is only a good black man who has been framed by bitter, racist cops even though everything points to his innocence; and boy, does Jewison spread it on thick! We trace Paterson&apos;s hatred of Carter all the way back to childhood and a scene where he comments on Carter&apos;s boxing fame just so we are totally clear that he wanted Carter more than anything! It&apos;s a real shame because the truth must be more interesting than this, although I imagine a lot more complex and for the film to just present such a clear cut and simplistic view of real life events not only insults the intelligence of the audience, it also does a disservice to the real life events it represents.

The cast are a big reason most of the film is interesting, or rather Denzel is a big reason it works. How close his Carter is to the real Carter is anyone&apos;s guess but his dialogue and his performance are both great. Washington made me believe this man&apos;s inner struggle by looks, words, tone of voice  this is the performance he deserved his Oscar for, not the more showy (and less controversial) one in Training Day. Shannon is also good even if he is far from central to the film. Unger, Schreiber and Hannah have clearly been told to play &apos;non-threatening white people&apos; and they are all about as bland as a collection of people as I have seen. There is no meat on their characters and, as a result the three just play them very simple, basic and far too &apos;nice&apos; to be believable; I&apos;m not suggesting we have more detail on their lives but there was nothing to them whatsoever  a real problem when they are asked to carry some scenes near the end by themselves. Hedaya gets paid with a lazy &apos;racist cop&apos; role that he can do nothing with, while Brown is OK in a return to his Shawshank role. Pastore, Steiger, Yulin and Paymer all add the feeling of depth in minor roles but really this is Washington&apos;s film and he is a big reason I found it entertaining.

Overall this was potentially an interesting, compelling and emotional film based on an intriguing real life story of injustice. However the script simplifies the story and characters to the point of being almost a version for people in a rush or without the intelligence to understand more. I cannot understand why the film just brushed past areas that would have made it more interesting (albeit more morally complex) and Jewison is to blame for a film that is very black and white in the portrayal of circumstances and its characters. Washington&apos;s performance and well written dialogue makes the film worth seeing but I was surprised by the film&apos;s ability to take an interesting and compelling story and simplify it to the point of lacking any real punch (sorry  he starts with a pun and he ends with a pun!).

Hush Up Sweet Charlotte,"Old Charlotte Holler is about to lose everything, especially her mind.","My buddies and I were looking for something to do in San Francisco during the week and came across a movie premiere at the Castro Theater. I had never heard of the film or the actors but thought when in Rome.... There were many people in line and in the theater who were well aware of the actors and the subject matter and excited for the showing. I am not a fan of old movies and became aware that this was not really a remake but a parody of an old black and white horror movie. I was skeptical - however after the first 10-15 minutes I was hooked. Never once did this film pretend to be a big box office Hollywood smash but had great lines, very awesome photography, and some great comedic acting. At one point the lights went out in the area and there was an unplanned intermission. Normally I would have walked away and found something else to do. Strangely enough - the non-fan-boy of classic films found himself patiently waiting for the electricity to be restored so the show could go on. Go figure.

As it was part of the Melbourne International Film Festival program this year, I closed one eye and picked something that sounded mildly interesting to watch with a friend. 

This is a movie-adaption of Dan Well&apos;s book, which already received quite a reputation, but I didn&apos;t know that. Heck, I didn&apos;t even bother to look at the cast list, or anything further than the &apos;psychological thriller&apos; genre. Boy, was I in for a ride. 

Overall, I was mildly surprised by how entertaining this movie was. The pacing was adequate - not rushed, nor was it too slow. It was also quite easy to follow with no convolution in the story and it doesn&apos;t feel forced. I was even more impressed about the clever slice of humor being thrown here and there. I enjoyed the cinematography and clever use of sound effects to keep you at the edge of your seat. 

So I&apos;m giving this a good rating, simply because I really enjoyed it - and that 2016 really need more gems like these.

I Confess,"A priest, who comes under suspicion for murder, cannot clear his name without breaking the seal of the confessional.","I Confess (1953)

This is one of Hitchcock&apos;s darkest films, and one of the best for seamless believability--it lacks some of the breaks from verisimilitude that bigger hits like Psycho and Vertigo famously use. It also has the incomparable Montgomery Clift, who took intensity to new heights as the first in a series of great method actors in the 1950s. He really wasn&apos;t a Hitchcock kind of actor (the director liked the artifice and changeability of a Cary Grant or Jimmy Stewart much more), but he makes the film what it is, and Hitchcock surely knew it, and made the most of it. When the camera (in the hand of Robert Burks) sweeps up to a full screen view of Clift&apos;s face and you see those glowing, brooding eyes, you fall under their collective spell. Yeah, it&apos;s great stuff.

The plot is pretty simple and amazing--a priest (Clift) learns something in a confession that come to haunt him in unexpected and very threatening ways. Hitchcock manages to push the envelope a little, as usual, in this case by having an illicit-seeming sexual affair be one of the keys to the plot. This implication naturally complicates the priest&apos;s life, but during the main plot of the movie and in a cheery flashback for backstory. Anne Baxter, the principled, strong woman (also not a Hitchcock forte) is terrific throughout, terrific the way Ingrid Bergman was in Notorious. Unlike most of Hitchcock&apos;s output, there is essentially no comic relief here, and the light and camera-work are equally dark--and truly gorgeous.

The French New Wave directors really admired this particular film of Hitchcock&apos;s, and you can see why. But it is also just a great, fast, distressing American melodrama set in France. It&apos;s not sensational, but it is spectacular, one of my favorites among many by this odd, brilliant auteur.",10,"['Crime', 'Drama', 'Thriller']","['priest', 'church', 'catholic', 'confessional', 'safe full of money']",1953-02-18,['Alfred Hitchcock'],"['Montgomery Clift', 'Anne Baxter', 'Karl Malden']","['George Tabori', 'William Archibald', 'Paul Anthelme']"

Both are excellent and should have captured a larger audience&apos;s attention.

But the main feature, the documentary, it is good, a little short, but good nonetheless. I read that Talia Shire&apos;s interview footage wasn&apos;t used. That&apos;s too bad, the film makers could have used a few extra minutes to pad this documentary out.

This is a nice, old-fashioned Retro style Horror Thriller with great creepy atmosphere and mood. The film uses an effective style with old-fashioned makeup and effects.

Ice Cream Man,"Poor Gregory. After being released from the Wishing Well Sanatorium, all he wants to do is make the children happy.

Ice Cream Man is two scoops of scary fun from the good old days when R-rated movies were marketed to children. When kids hear this ice cream truck coming, they run...for their lives! It may not be the cream of the crop but could leave you frozen with fear.

Ron Howard&apos;s brother plays an overtly creepy Ice Cream Man. From behind the barred windows of his ice cream truck, he doles out ice cream from bloody, pest ridden tubs and commits the occasional murder. Soon his antics attract the attention of the neighborhood kids as well as two police detectives played by Jean Michael Vincent and Lee Majors II. Will the ice cream man&apos;s dreams of having a shop of his own melt away under the heat of his own un-cone-trollable killing sprees?

Clint Howard is well cast as a murderous creep. He inhabits the role the way a hand inhabits a mitten. Similar in style to Peewee&apos;s Big Adventure and Serial Mom: upright and proper suburban facades concealing abnormality, the way my t-shirt hides a dark underbelly. Violent scenes are few and not very explicit. If anything it&apos;s worth watching just to see Clint Howard hamming it up.

It&apos;s a schlocky Star Wars derivative with a lot of campy 70s feel with some Alien and Mad Max thrown in. It&apos;s a lot of silly slapstick and broad sex comedy. I would like it if the jokes are actually funny. For some, this may be so bad that it&apos;s good. For me, this is mostly bad with a lot of amusement at how good actors get trapped in bad movies. The sets and costumes are a cheesy mix. The special effects are good B-movie work. I can&apos;t believe Anjelica Huston is in this. It&apos;s fun to see John Matuszak hulking over Ron Perlman.

For the good part, I have to say that I enjoyed how they tried to show how people used to live five millenniums ago. I don&apos;t know if it was really like that or not, but I appreciated the attempt. You don&apos;t see often that kind of undertaking.

However, the story that unfolded was nothing but modern day Hollywood blockbusters set in another era. Put Tom Cruise in the main role and you have everything. Was that all they could come up with?

Identity,"Stranded at a desolate Nevada motel during a nasty rain storm, ten strangers become acquainted with each other when they realize that they&apos;re being killed off one by one.","A+

Every so often I like to go into films knowing very little about them. It&apos;s gratifying not hearing any news stories, or Internet rumors, or early reviews before you see a film because you can genuinely feel surprised by every passing minute of it. In the case of Identity, I only saw a trailer for it once in theatres and I saw various TV spots before its release, but other than that I knew nothing about the core of the story. I went in with no preconceived notions or opinions. For a change I was being a submissive film viewer.

After the credits rolled (by the way I rarely stay until the end of the credits) I was so amazed and surprised by the film that I had just experienced. Identity is a highly original, beautifully constructed, and a mildly scary film that will (excuse my language) do a serious mind f*** on your brain. 

The less you know about Identity&apos;s plot, the better. This is the kind of film you need to go into knowing very little about. There are a few twists, plenty of scares, and also a very surprising ending that will have some people disappointed, or praising its creativity. I&apos;m definitely in the latter on this one.

Identity is also a masterpiece of atmosphere. Something that I think is the most important aspect of any movie in this genre. Whether it&apos;s Halloween, setting the scene for small town horror, or The Ring, drenching us in very dark and Gothic scenery, atmosphere is what makes or breaks a horror film. Thankfully Identity succeeds by creating an atmosphere that is truly frightening and visually impressive. The motel is a perfect setting for the proceedings that take place throughout the night.

A nice ensemble cast rounds out Identity&apos;s many incredible attributes. John Cusack gives a very good performance as Ed. Cusack has always been good at playing the &apos;everyday normal guy&apos; and he uses this to great effect here. It&apos;s a layered performance that offers some surprises throughout the picture.

The other high profile performer is the always-reliable Ray Liotta as Rhodes. Liotta never seems to disappoint whenever he&apos;s performing, even in sub-par material. He&apos;s just as good as he usually is in this picture and he uses his sometimes-abrasive personality to its utmost potential.

Amanda Peet gives her best performance to date as Paris. She has some nice moments where she&apos;s allowed sprinkle some comic relief throughout an otherwise dreary picture. However, when she&apos;s required to exhibit real fear, she is more than capable. She also shares some good scenes with Cusack during a few key moments in the film.

Clea Duvall and William Lee Scott supply some youth and tenacity as Ginny and Lou. Duvall probably has the role typically called the &apos;scream queen role&apos; in most horror films and she does well with what she&apos;s given. There were times that I could genuinely feel her fear. Scott is given less to do as Lou but he does have some good scenes with Duvall that requires a decent amount of emotion.

John Hawkes and John C. McGinley are also adequate in supporting roles. Hawkes is given a fair share of the comedic lines and for the most part he plays the part well. McGinley fairs better as the husband who must tend for his injured wife and social inadequate stepson. If I felt sympathy for anyone the most, it was his character.

Rebecca Demornay is given very little to do as the failed movie actress but there are some funny jokes made at her expense as one character asks her &apos;didn&apos;t you used to be that actress?&apos; This is some clever commentary on Demornay&apos;s obviously fledgling career. The same can be said for Jake Busey as the convict, who is given little to do and seems out of place when paired with the more talented actors in the picture.

What&apos;s important is the work these actors do when they&apos;re all together. This is very much an ensemble and they play off each other&apos;s fear. Their reactions to these situations make the picture all the more frightening.

On the other end of the story, Alfred Molina brings a bit of substance to his role, despite have limited screen time as the psychiatrist and Pruitt Taylor Vance will shock, amaze, and terrify you as the murderer waiting for his execution. Vance&apos;s portrayal is very frightening, and an ultimately brilliant performance. Given the limited screen time he does a lot with the role.

Identity is filled with secrets, surprises, and scares that will have moviegoers talking for quite some time. Much like The Ring it has the potential to have some word of mouth appeal. However, don&apos;t listen too much to what people have to say about it because it&apos;s best to experience this modern masterpiece of fear, knowing very little about it.

Idle Hands,A teenage slacker&apos;s right hand becomes possessed with murderous intent.,"Now that may sound like innuendo and if you think so - well the movie gives you lots of reasons to feel there is even more innuendo. Be it our main character hiding in the bush(es) of his neighbor or proclaiming he isn&apos;t able to control his hand. Something boys may like to claim when they discover their sexuality I reckon.

But while this has a bit of nudity (literally) and some hot situations, it does focus more on the horror and comedy stuff it has. It does get violent and it does have blood in it - but it also is as funny as it gets. And one of the reasons is how Devon Sawa is able to do all the physical stuff himself. He says himself he was young and just threw himself in everything - have to admit very well done.

I liked the movie back when it came out and I still like it - it seems to had some issues when it was released because of a massive school schooting in America - Politicians blaming movies and games for that - which those involved sarcastically take apart in the commentary on the newly released Blu Ray.

There are so many funny and good moments in here ... but there are also questionable decisions. Jessica Alba being attracted to someone who has shows red flags than you can imagine. Do not watch this taking it apart for those reasons if you can - the movie does not tell us what we should do when it comes to the opposite sex.

Immortal Beloved,"The life and death of the legendary Ludwig van Beethoven. Besides all the work he is known for, the composer once wrote a famous love letter to a nameless beloved, and the movie tries to find out who this beloved was--not easy, as...","Ludwig van Beethoven was one of the greatest composers-- some would say THE greatest-- in the history of the world. But what of the man himself? His passions, his loves? The humanness behind the genius? `Immortal Beloved,&apos; written and directed by Bernard Rose, examines the man behind the music in a dramatization focusing on the mystery behind a letter-- written by Beethoven-- found among his effects after his death in 1827. The letter bears no name or address, but was written to a woman to whom he refers as his `immortal beloved,&apos; with nary a clue as to her identity. But in his final will, it is she to whom he bequeaths his estate, and it therefore falls to Beethoven&apos;s secretary, Anton Schindler (Jeroen Krabbe), to unravel the mystery and discover her identity. And as Schindler pursues his quest, a portrait of Beethoven, in his most human aspect, emerges. 	Reminiscent of the approach taken by Orson Welles with `Citizen Kane,&apos; Rose presents a riveting study of the enigmatic genius that was Beethoven. He suggests a man driven by passion and ego, who was under appreciated during his lifetime (as great artists often are), and who grew bitter in the wake of the slings and arrows fate so surreptitiously hurled at him. The great irony of his life, of course, was the deafness that deprived him of the aural beauty of his own creation, an affliction Rose implies was brought about through the brutality of a drunken father who would beat his son about the head and ears (And in retrospect, what a testimony to his genius, that he could write such music in his head without ever hearing an actual note). 	As Beethoven, Gary Oldman gives an outstanding performance, one for which he should have received acclaim that somehow was never forthcoming. His ability to create a total character, with such incredible emotional depth as he does here, is astounding. It&apos;s puzzling as to why so many of his performances are overlooked, especially at Oscar time. Besides this film, consider his work in `Sid and Nancy,&apos; or more recently in `The Contender.&apos; He is simply a tremendous actor who has yet to have his day in the sun. As Beethoven, he so completely immerses himself in the character that his soul is veritably reflected in his eyes. You feel the silent world in which he was confined for most of his life, and it allows you to identify with the inner turmoil with which he had to cope and endure without respite. Most importantly, Oldman makes you feel that unabashed passion that motivated and drove Beethoven on. It&apos;s quite simply a remarkable performance. Turning in notable performances as well are Isabella Rossellini, as Anna Marie Erdody, one of the women in Beethoven&apos;s life who may or may not have been the one to whom the letter was intended, and Johanna ter Steege, as Johanna, Beethoven&apos;s sister-in-law and the mother of his beloved nephew, Karl (Marco Hofschneider). 	The supporting cast includes Miriam Margolyes (Nanette), Barry Humphries (Clemens), Valeria Golino (Giulietta), Gerard Horan (Nikolaus), Christopher Fulford (Casper), Alexandra Pigg (Therese) and Luigi Diberti (Franz). Beethoven&apos;s renown today, of course, exceeds even mythological proportions, which often facilitates the blending of fiction with fact. But with `Immortal Beloved,&apos; whether or not the finer points are historically accurate or not is of little consequence, for at it&apos;s heart this is a love story that is engrossing drama that is altogether transporting. It&apos;s a memorable film, highlighted by Oldman&apos;s performance and, of course, the music. And there are a number of scenes, as well, that are unforgettable and demand mention. One depicting the debut performance of the `Ode to Joy,&apos; and another in which the young Beethoven (played by Leo Faulkner) runs at night through the streets of the city to escape his drunken father (Fintan McKeown), coming at last to a lake, into which he wades to float on his back; and with the camera positioned directly above, looking down upon him, a billion stars are reflected in the water around him. Then slowly the camera pulls back until the young Ludwig blends with the reflected stars to seemingly take his place among all the brightest lights of the firmament. It&apos;s a scene that will leave you breathless and remain etched in your memory forever.

Lo imposible,The story of a tourist family in Thailand caught in the destruction and chaotic aftermath of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami.,"It would be impossible to try and capture the widespread loss and destruction of this horrible, devastating event. The scope was so large and far too many people lost their lives to even attempt to portray on film. Instead, director Juan Antonio Bayona and screenwriter Sergio G. Sánchez focused smartly on the true story of one family&apos;s struggle for survival amongst all that had happened on December 26th, 2004. 

This allows the film to be much more intimate, and the audience is quickly able to connect with the Bennett family, starting simply with their arrival to Thailand. While the audience was filled with dread in anticipation of what was to come, the Bennetts were blissfully unaware and enjoying themselves over vacation. However, everything soon takes a terrifying turn as the tsunami hits their resort in a horrifyingly realistic manner, sweeping up people as they attempt to flee before it or protect themselves from its awesome power.

At this point, I, too, felt like I was drowning. The camera bobs in and out of darkness, in and out of the water, as the family&apos;s matriarch, Maria, struggles for breath. Then, clinging hopelessly onto a palm tree, she screams all too realistically for anyone who could possibly help her in a desperate, surprisingly shocking moment. It is at this point where she spots her son, Lucas, floating in the fierce waves, and I held my breath as the struggled for what seemed like an eternity to reunite in the water.

In a way, Lucas, brilliantly portrayed by newcomer Tom Holland, carries the film from this point forward. He takes on the role of protecting his stubborn yet badly injured mother, and in the process he&apos;s forced to mature far too quickly. During every moment, his emotions and facial expressions convey more than any words ever could, as she shies away from and is frightened by his mother&apos;s injuries and nudity, all the while attempting to deal with the scope of the pain and devastation.

However, it is his mother, Maria, whom the film truly centers around. Naomi Watts gives quite possibly her finest performances to date, portraying harrowing desperation, stubborn determination in the face of incredible pain and agony, and, ultimately, a sense of love and care despite her deteriorating state. True, she is bedridden for about half the film, but it is during this time where there are these small moments of tenderness and humility which undoubtedly makes Watts&apos;s performance one of the best of the year.

In fact, the entire cast was exceptional, including Ewan McGregor, the father desperately trying to put together his family again, and the two littlest sons, Thomas, played by Samuel Joslin, and Simon, played by Oaklee Pendergast, both of whose innocence prevented them from thoroughly capturing the extent of this tragic event. The story of these three is intertwined with that of Maria and Lucas, as they all struggle for survive amidst the destruction and reunite amidst the chaos. 

Ultimately, this is a touching and heartwarming film, as the true kindness of humanity can be seen in this time of great loss. Yes, the tsunami is terrifying, the injuries gruesome and shockingly realistic, and the pain and suffering visible on just about everyone&apos;s faces. However, the Bennetts&apos; story is a remarkable one of love, determination, and hope, and it simply cannot be missed.",10,"['Adventure', 'Drama', 'History']","['disaster film', 'disaster', 'tidal wave', '2004 indian ocean earthquake and tsunami', 'year 2004']",2013-01-04,['J.A.

In a Lonely Place,"A potentially violent screenwriter is a murder suspect until his lovely neighbor clears him. However, she soon starts to have her doubts.","This is one of my all time favourite films, and (alongside the obvious - Casablanca, Maltese Falcon etc) my favourite Bogart.

The script is smart, witty and cynical, just like a typical Bogart character. But in this film Bogart plays probably his darkest character.

 In some of the scenes with Gloria Graeme he&apos;s at his smooth, wisecracking, slightly irritable best, but in the moments where the anger and the fog of despair descends he is a more threatening character than in any of his other leading man roles.

The cynical, darker aspects of this film just go to highlight how few contemporary films are prepared to be so bleak.

Despite the fact that the plot is ostensibly a &apos;did he do it?&apos; crime story, this is largely inconsequential to the psychological character and relationship study that is the central concern of the film.

 If you like a cracking script with sharp performances, with all kinds of deep psychological observations on love and loneliness to be read into it, in the best noir tradition, this is the film for you.",10,"['Drama', 'Film-Noir', 'Mystery']","['screenwriter', 'police investigation', 'murder', 'alibi', 'suspense']",,['Nicholas Ray'],"['Humphrey Bogart', 'Gloria Grahame', 'Frank Lovejoy']","['Andrew Solt', 'Edmund H.

In the Name of the Father,A man&apos;s coerced confession to an I.R.A. bombing he did not commit results in the imprisonment of his father as well. An English lawyer fights to free them.,"Even though this movie seems a bit too black and white from time to time I must say that it still is an impressive piece of cinema. Too black and white because I sometimes had the feeling that they had left out some parts to make it all a lot easier for the viewer. I can&apos;t help believing that Conlon and Hill weren&apos;t the nicest guys either, but the movie shows them almost as saints (except for the fact that they steal some lead from the roofs, they never really do anything wrong). Does that mean that this movie isn&apos;t any good? Certainly not! It still remains very impressive and the idea that injustice in the name of protecting the country should be allowed is awful and so it is good that at least some movie makers aren&apos;t afraid to protest against it.

The movie tells the story about Gerry Conlon and his old school friend Paul Hill. They both are small time criminals and because of their own safety they have to live in London for a while. Otherwise they might get shot by the IRA. In London they stay in a community of hippies, but aren&apos;t welcomed by everybody. As a bomb explodes in a pub, one of the members from the community goes to the police and accuses them of the crime. They are immediately apprehended, together with Conlon&apos;s father, his aunt and her family. What follows is a process full of corruption and false accusations, putting them in jail for many years even though they haven&apos;t done anything wrong.

The film is very good. It&apos;s well acted, well paced and well directed. The story is touching and I never got bored when watching it. Therefor I give it an 8/10.",8,"['Biography', 'Crime', 'Drama']","['prison', 'father son relationship', 'based on true story', 'wrongfully convicted', 'wrongfully convicted of murder']",1994-02-25,['Jim Sheridan'],"['Daniel Day-Lewis', 'Pete Postlethwaite', 'Alison Crosbie']","['Gerry Conlon', 'Terry George', 'Jim Sheridan']"

It starts off pretty cliché but it quickly finds its own footing. I enjoy the way the storyline is portrayed, it never gets predictable which is always a positive in this genre. Most of the scares are the cheap, cop-out type, which stops the film being frightening. However, it makes up for it by creating tense, uneasy scenarios for the characters.

Crystal Reed and Emilia Jones produce what&apos;s necessary in the lead role of Beth, those two do rather carry proceedings but the other members of the (small) cast aren&apos;t a hindrance in any way; the premise focuses on Beth, so you&apos;d expect Reed and Jones to stand out most.

I was locked in for it all, despite the fact I would&apos;ve liked improved scare elements as opposed to average jump scares.

Except for a hammy Albert Cole as Cass, the acting is pretty good, with Dern refusing temptation to go over the top. Also, the hulking John Bloom amounts to a casting inspiration. His massive frame dominates every frame he&apos;s in. Plus he manages the difficult role of the slow-witted in convincing fashion. 

Staging takes place in the boondocks where there&apos;s more bang for the buck, and while the massive monster may be too slow to be scary, the shrewd camera angles make the two-headed effect more credible than expected. Oh sure, the movie&apos;s title is a tip-off to the target audience. Still, I wouldn&apos;t put it in the same league as the rubber monsters of Roger Corman yore. 

Good to see an elderly Berry Kroeger picking up a payday. Was there ever a better shyster lawyer in a slew of 40&apos;s noirs than the moon-faced actor. And speaking of cast, blonde leading lady Pat Priest could double for Doris Day in her bouffant heyday. Anyway, I found the flick mildly entertaining and not as hokey as I expected.

Independence Day,"The aliens are coming and their goal is to invade and destroy Earth. Fighting superior technology, mankind&apos;s best weapon is the will to survive.","Independence Day is the sort of film that&apos;s best appreciated on a big screen, preferably a massive great plasma television that is so huge you had to cut the roof off your house and get airlifted in by helicopters just to get it in the living room. You should also have the most state of the art surround sound possible, with bass pickups so deep they cause earthquakes on the Eastern seaboard. Not because Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich&apos;s alien invasion flick is a masterpiece of cinematic art or anything, but because it&apos;s loud. Very loud. And if the windows in your house don&apos;t shatter when the spaceship flies over New York then well, you&apos;re just not experiencing it properly.

Taking the 1950&apos;s invasion narratives and pro-tooling them for 90&apos;s audiences, Independence Day is an absolute blast of visual flare and gung ho heroism. The plot is so straightforward as to be superfluous (aliens invade, fights ensue) but even so, it remains an invigorating watch purely because of the spectacle it provides. Back in 1996, the sight of that giant blue laser tearing apart lower Manhattan made jaws drop and while it&apos;s unlikely to do the same to today&apos;s overstimulated audiences, it&apos;s still an incredible visual feast. What&apos;s more, the ensemble cast makes it surprisingly unpredictable - we all know that the aliens will be defeated at the end, but what isn&apos;t so obvious is which characters are going to be alive to see it. Except for the kid and the dog. They&apos;re relatively safe bets.

Watching it now though, it does possess a cheerful naivety in the face of world politics. After all, this was 1996, the Cold War was over and 9/11 a long way off, so the entire world uniting against a common foe without being bogged down with petty arguments and personal agendas still seemed believable. Hell, even the gun-toting Arabs that briefly appear on screen are more than happy to rally behind Uncle Sam in the name of freedom. That&apos;s right folks, it&apos;s an Americans Save The World movie, complete with a snapshot of British officers drinking tea in the desert and waiting for those silly yanks to get a bally move on and show us what to do.

Needless to say, this is blockbuster entertainment through and through. The aliens are apparently here to strip mine the planet of all her natural resources, but they&apos;re quite happy to put that off for a bit in order to blow things up for the entire running time. Fans of in-depth characterisation, intelligent story telling and emotional engagement with the protagonists are wasting their time, but if you want to watch tourist attractions, jet planes and space craft exploding for three hours, you can&apos;t really go wrong. That business about a computer virus bringing down the mother-ship is a bit daft though, not once did they try switching everything on and off again.",7,"['Action', 'Adventure', 'Sci-Fi']","['exotic dancer', 'product placement', 'fourth of july', 'alien fighter craft', 'saving the world mission']",1996-07-03,['Roland Emmerich'],"['Will Smith', 'Bill Pullman', 'Jeff Goldblum']","['Dean Devlin', 'Roland Emmerich']"

Tokugawa irezumi-shi: Seme jigoku,Two highly skilled tattoo artists clash as the demand for tattooed geishas rises to satisfy European clients.,"A film about obsessions on bondage and tattoos, disguised as historically adequate treatment of an inglorious episode in Japans long gone past. It&apos;s ingredients are violence, brothels, tattoos, female whorehouse bosses, tattoos, mean pimps, even meaner prostitutes, tattoos, whips, knives, drugs, torture and tattoos. The main theme is the transformation of young girls&apos; skins into pieces of art, depicting both abstract and figurative motives, the latter mainly dealing with death, birth, violence and other more or less disturbing themes. Compared to other far eastern films from the same exploitation category, the violence seems almost moderate. The narration, in a fairytale-like old fashioned style, is, of course, a child of it&apos;s time. In total, the film&apos;s not so good, but not so bad either; it is not very original, but still (in a positive sense) light years away from the commercial cinema we have today  which is intriguing since films like this, in their days, were themselves first and foremost done to make money.",7,"['Crime', 'Drama', 'Horror']","['sadomasochism', 'tattoo', 'injection', 'captive woman', 'chain']",1969-05-02,['Teruo Ishii'],"['Teruo Yoshida', 'Masumi Tachibana', 'Asao Koike']",[]

I went in expecting a low budget campy horror B-movie and wow, I certainly did not expect a movie that good in overall.

Most of the actors are quite good, even the extras, and the main character and his entourage are surprisingly well developed for this kind of movie.

I wouldn&apos;t call the movie fast=paced, but the action in well maintained throughout and starts after less than 10 minutes, so no long buildup, the bugs are there at the beginning, you get to know more about them as the movie goes so there are no long boring explanations.

The CGI is very well done and keeps you in the movie and there are plenty of bugs of a few kinds.

But what really did the movie for me was the dark humor, think Shaun of the Dead, but with insects. Even if the movie has a serious tone, you always get some well done jokes here and there, mostly by the likable anti-hero that just seems to try so hard.

A must see for the horror/comedy fans and for the critters fans in general.",9,"['Action', 'Adventure', 'Comedy']","['insect', 'bug', 'deafness', 'monster movie', 'weatherwoman']",2009-11-28,['Kyle Rankin'],"['Christopher Rodriguez Marquette', 'Brooke Nevin', 'Kinsey Packard']",['Kyle Rankin']
Quel maledetto treno blindato,"In 1944 France, a group of escaped American military prisoners en route to Switzerland volunteers to steal a German V2 rocket warhead for the Allies.","Here&apos;s one the lightest, most fun Italian war movies I&apos;ve come across. It features a top notch cast and some great action scenes.

Bo Svenson stars as an American officer who&apos;s thrown into a prison convoy with a murderer, Tony (Peter Hooten), Fred (Fred Williamson), a thief, Nick (Michael Pergolani), and a coward, Berle (Jackie Basehart). The convoy comes under attack by the Germans and the men escape across the French countryside. They enventually become wrapped up in an important Allied mission headed by Colonel Buckner (Ian Bannen).

The movie features a top notch cast. Peter Hooten is especially memorable as the bigot, Tony and Fred Williamson turns in a great performance. Bo Svenson, himself a renegade, still tries to do the decent job as an officer and keep these boys in line. Michael Pergolani has little to do in his role as the hippie/thief; he does have one great motorcycle stunt scene, though, a la Steve McQueen in THE GREAT ESCAPE. Watch for Michel Constantin (THE DIRTY HEROES) as a partisan leader; Donald O&apos;Brien as a German officer and Enzo Castellari himself as a German officer.

The movie has some stunning action scenes; there are plenty of shootouts and explosions. The big gun battle amidst ruined German and American trucks and halftracks is especially impressive. The Partisan raid on the train near the end is well filmed, but features many repeated shots of the same action happening over and over again. The miniature work is not the greatest, but is much better than the later BATTLE OF THE EAGLES.

The plot is basically a combination of THE DIRTY DOZEN and BATTLE OF THE COMMANDOS, but it&apos;s so fast-paced that you won&apos;t really care. Castellari lets only a few minutes go by before something important happens. He really develops his lead characters, which is another important feature we don&apos;t get to see much of in typical Italian war films.

Despite all of the good stuff, this movie has a few rough spots. For one thing, it&apos;s got a very needless love story sub-plot that never goes anywhere and has nothing to do with the rest of the movie. Another complaint: there are some lengthy conversations between the German characters that weren&apos;t dubbed. It&apos;s impossible to understand what they&apos;re saying.

The movie is not for young kids. It features graphic violence, plenty of profanity and even *full* female nudity in one scene.

The version I saw was from Lightning Video, entitled DEADLY MISSION. The source print was of top quality, with fresh picture and good sound. The opening and closing titles, however, were apparently new material and feature some music that isn&apos;t heard anywhere else in the feature.

Overall, this is a fun-to-watch Italian adventure piece. For the great cast, production values and action scenes, I&apos;ll give a 6/10.",8,"['Action', 'Adventure', 'War']","['american', 'nazi', 'shootout', 'skinny dipping', 'american army']",,['Enzo G.

Inside,"Nemo, a high-end art thief, is trapped in a New York penthouse after his heist doesn&apos;t go as planned. Locked inside with nothing but priceless works of art, he must use all his cunning and ingenuity to survive.","A high-end art thief becomes trapped inside a luxury, high-tech penthouse in New York&apos;s Times Square after his heist doesn&apos;t go as planned. Locked inside with nothing but priceless works of art, he must use all his cunning and invention to survive.

If you&apos;ve seen the trailer, Inside is exactly what you think it is: a man trapped in a high-end condo with no avenues of escape. The no-frills, approach to the story hits the ground running with Willem DaFoe&apos;s Nemo trapped within the first 10 minutes. These 10 minutes are enough to establish the only necessaries the audience needs: art thief, in a penthouse loaded with expensive artwork, owner out of the country. The other 95 minutes showcase Nemo&apos;s ingenuity, his many setbacks, and his decaying thought process as the penthouse deteriorates into a wasteland of filth, a visual representation of his mental state. As a one man show, it&apos;s incredible to watch DaFoe&apos;s Nemo work through his obstacles and observe how he navigates his failures. As a movie, it&apos;s longer than it needs to be, wearing its premise thin before Nemo reaches his final conclusion.

Willem DaFoe is a one man force in this movie. While it&apos;s been done countless times throughout cinema to varying degrees (Sam Rockwell in Moon, Redford in All Is Lost, Tom Hardy in Locke), the concept of seeing only one person on the screen for the vast majority of the performance is a tall task for an actor and DaFoe&apos;s slow descent into madness is expertly conveyed. An actor who&apos;s shown multiple times over his career to play characters that are a bit unhinged or or coming apart at the scenes, DaFoe calls upon those past roles to portray a man losing his grip on reality the more desperate he becomes. The internet loves to poke fun at DaFoe&apos;s crazy eyes and wild performances, and Inside shows just how good he is with these types of roles.

Directed by first time director Vasilis Katsoupis, Inside shows promise in an interesting directing career while also displaying some flaws. A one person story that carries across an feature length runtime is a difficult enough feat for a veteran storyteller; Katsoupis tackles it right out of the gate. Inside is highlighted by its minimalist nature; the only things the viewer has to focus on is Willem DaFoe and the penthouse. To its credit, the production design is well thought out, lending a sense of someone with far too much money having just enough items scattered about to give Nemo a fighting chance at survival. Katsoupis and screenwriter Ben Hopkins dole out enough small victories (and a number of setbacks) to keep audiences baited and rooting for the thief.

Overall, Inside is a decent feature debut from Katsoupis. At 105 minutes, the pacing drags at times due to not having enough material to justify its runtime. Had 15-20 minutes been shaved from the story, viewers would&apos;ve experienced a much more lean, faster moving story of a man desperate to escape. As it stands, though, it&apos;s a great vessel to spotlight Willem DaFoe&apos;s talents and let him shine. Great production design, an intriguing premise, and an actor talented enough to hold the audience&apos;s attention for the majority of the time, the film is good enough weeknight watch after work.",6,"['Drama', 'Thriller']","['psychological drama', 'art', 'f word', 'profanity']",2023-03-17,['Vasilis Katsoupis'],"['Willem Dafoe', 'Gene Bervoets', 'Eliza Stuyck']","['Ben Hopkins', 'Vasilis Katsoupis']"
Inside Daisy Clover,A tomboy turned movie star deals with the cruelty of Hollywood.,"This movie often seems surrealistic, sometimes comic, sometimes despairing and it has musical numbers which come from another dimension entirely--they are a mix of Busby Berkeley and 1960s design. The film seems like an eccentric comedy at first with 15 year-old tomboy Daisy (Natalie Wood) and her wacky mother (Ruth Gordon) both competing over who can chew scenery faster. Suddenly, she&apos;s plucked by sinister studio head Christopher Plummer and turned into a star. The studios of the time were certainly often sinister, but I found the dispatch of Ma Clover to the mental institution a bit of a stretch. The film has other implausible moments plus a tone of anachronism as the songs, by Andre and Dory Previn, are 1960s Broadway in style. Many scenes of loneliness and isolation--a strangely deserted Santa Monica pier,an empty desert motel, a studio that always seems empty, even the sound stages seem empty. You rarely see the bustle you expect in a film set at a studio or in Hollywood. This is an odd, fascinating, 1/2 successful film.",7,"['Drama', 'Music', 'Romance']","['rags to riches', 'tomboy', 'female protagonist', 'bisexual man', 'marital infidelity']",1966-04-27,['Robert Mulligan'],"['Natalie Wood', 'Christopher Plummer', 'Robert Redford']",['Gavin Lambert']

Intolerance: Love&apos;s Struggle Throughout the Ages,The story of a poor young woman separated by prejudice from her husband and baby is interwoven with tales of intolerance from throughout history.,"My primary interest in this was as a foundation of cinema; so an academic interest, but - having influenced so many things I am very keen on - not without some excitement at the prospect of discovery of this early common source.

So much of cinema flows out from this; a host of recognizable names tutored on set - Von Stroheim, Tod Browning, Woody Van Dyke, Victor Fleming, Elmer Clifton, Jack Conway, King Vidor - and even more once the film rippled across the world. In Moscow, it was the raw material film students were given to dismantle in Lev Kuleshov&apos;s fledgling film school, the first ever. And in France Abel Gance must have been awe-struck by the sheer size of the canvas, if his own films offer any clue. 

So yes, a fast-paced, lavish blockbuster - it cost at the time an unprecedented $2m to make - with literally a cast of thousands animating history, the story of Hollywood excess begins here - in Italy it had started earlier, with their Roman spectacles. The filmmaker as god, who does not simply photograph reality but constructs entire worlds, permits our vision to travel in the places that we could earlier only imagine.

But the fundamental technique is still from the theatre; that means a grand stage - elevated from us, separate - with every now and then a different backdrop, actors who pantomime sweeping emotion, the eye usually fixed in a distance. Oh the camera moves, but it moves with the stage. And what a grand stage it is.

I suppose it must have been desirable at the time when cinema, and so the possibilities of seeing, made the world feel so new and perhaps so alive again, when so many of the trials and heroism of the world narrative were yet to be immortalized in this new way, that a film like this should try to encompass so much; the Crucifixion, medieval France, ancient Babylon, they&apos;re all urgently envisioned in the same space. 

It is in more ways than one that Griffith wrote the history of cinema then; by pioneering what he did in terms of a film language, but also by creating a vast expanse - a daunting 3 hours of film - that fills the prehistoric void, in terms of cinema, with a cachet of images, that creates a history of images. Now with the Pharisees or at the Persian camp of Cyrus, the court of Catherine or the harems of Babylon, common streets old and new; now we could point back and see, in a small measure, a history of film gathered in one place. So, when Kuleshov had tasked his students to rework the film, the choice was wise. There is so much here in terms of images, and so fertile for remodeling, that essentially he was presenting them with the empty sheet to write music on - that music, a deeply modernist product of synthesis, we called montage.

What does this filmmaker - as god - see though, what kind of worldview does he spring into life, this is more interesting I believe. 

The title summarizes well. So, a cruel - but institutionalized, thus state sanctioned - evil threatening to engulf and dissolve all that is kind, which is the individual life, and of course the warm sentimentality that eventually restores faith in the personal struggle. But nothing casts a shadow in this world, no depth or dimension beyond the plainly conceivable. So the people are straight-forward beings, either good or bad - our heroine is simply called The Dear One - or misguided at their most complex; or, when en masse, they are part of the decor, collectively writhing in some extravagant background. 

By the end, a heavenly chorus of angels illuminate the sky above a battlefield. The immediate contrast, like so much in the film, disarms with how much painstaking vision must have gone into making something so splendorous yet so naive. We can pretend like we ought to make amends with the time it was made, just like we can&apos;t pretend to look away with indifference, but the point remains; far more complex works of art had been made before, far less didactic about their humanitarian values.

You should at least see the segment with the siege of Babylon though, and the final scenes cross-cutting across time and space as we rush to the climax; it&apos;s things like these that so much was founded on.

(And another image that I recommend to those of you who have been charting all this; it is an inexplicable, tight close-up of the girl who is almost brushing, breathing into the camera. It happens once, and suggests intimacy that is never again encountered in the film. It&apos;s as though the girl, and so this cinema, is yearning to cross over into a new kind of film where faces hold all the mysteries and performances visualize innermost soul. Jean Epstein would make those films, ushering us in a new perception)",,"['Drama', 'History']","['babylon babylonia', 'paris france', 'jerusalem', 'multiple time frames', 'partially lost film']",1917-06-15,['D.W.

Intruders is a far better movie than some with the same subject. In my opinion it&apos;s better than The Strangers, not relying on torture porn, but offering a plot instead. The character development is nice, I think that hated ending by all makes more sense if you take in consideration that she is now alone. 

I will recommend this little gem to any horror fan out there looking for a nice way to spend around 90 minutes. Intruders is one of the good ones, no masterpiece, but keeps you in front of the screen for the entire ride.

Invaders from Mars,A young boy learns that space aliens are taking over the minds of earthlings.,"Lots of positive and negative feedback for this film, and I can understand why. Whether we want to admit it or not, nostalgia does have an impact on how we view things. As someone between the two generations(early 30&apos;s at this time), I can understand how I have put special importance on things I watched as a child. I know that some of these films were not too good but they mean&apos;t a lot to me. I also know that I was the kind of person that watched older films and appreciated them if they were good, and watched newer films and appreciated them if they were good. The biggest problem with many younger viewers today is that they do not look at a film in a context of when it was made, nor do they look at the most important aspect of the film which is what message is the film trying to relate....NOT how does it look in relating its message. We as a society are too caught up with presentation and other superficial things that sometimes we ignore what the core of something is. Anyway...enough philosophizing. This film is a good film period. Yep, it is cheaply made. Yep, it is filled with lots of stock footage, particularly the battle scenes which take place at night but footage takes place during day. Yep, it has mediocre acting. I won&apos;t argue those point because they are accurate. But those are only a part of the film...and for this film at least a very small part. This film has style and substance. Director William Cameron Menzies WAS a great director. He directed the science fiction classic Things To Come in the 30&apos;s which was a visionary masterpiece. He made this film fun to watch as he incorporated German expressionistic sets into his small-town simple story of a boy that knows aliens have landed on Earth in his back yard. The young boy played by Jimmy Hunt does a fine job in his role. The messages the film relates, however, are for me at least the core of the film....watch out for the ordinary....listen to children.....conformity is dangerous. This film is saying so much...give it a chance without worrying about window-dressing! And a final note...Long Live Morris Ankrum in film...I like him in this movie!",,"['Horror', 'Sci-Fi']","['alien', 'martian', 'mind control', 'alien invasion', 'underground hideout']",1953-04-22,['William Cameron Menzies'],"['Helena Carter', 'Arthur Franz', 'Jimmy Hunt']","['Richard Blake', 'John Tucker Battle']"

The Invisible Menace,An army private and his new bride are trying to honeymoon on an island occupied by the military and a murderer.,"Fine B mystery from Warner Bros. with nice foggy atmosphere and a good performance from Boris Karloff in a small but important role. Directed by John &apos;father of Mia&apos; Farrow, it&apos;s a good-looking picture that has a horror movie feel to it. The story involves a murder on an army base, with Karloff as one of the suspects. There&apos;s also some comic relief from Eddie Craven and Marie Wilson as a pair of newlyweds trying to have their honeymoon on the base without anyone knowing. The comedy upsets the fine mood Farrow sets but I&apos;m sure his hands were tied on that front. The rest of the cast includes Regis Toomey, Charles Trowbridge, Frank Faylen, and Henry Kolker. Cy Kendall plays a brutish investigator brought in to solve the crime. His method is to slap suspects around until they confess. Sherlock Holmes he&apos;s not!

The Iron Horse,"After witnessing the murder of his father by a renegade as a boy, the grown-up Brandon helps to realize his father&apos;s dream of a transcontinental railway.","The Iron Horse was both Ford&apos;s 50th film and one of the most important silent Westerns. Until the 29-year-old director came to work on this epic project, he had gradually built up an expertise and standing with a number of smaller productions, many of them oaters, few of which survive today. This 1924 film consolidated his talent and gave him a creative reputation which lasted until he was deemed &apos;old fashioned&apos; at the start of 1950s.

It&apos;s a story that characteristically combines the grand with the intimate, through a celebration of the coming of progress. The Iron Horse&apos;s narrative covers such issues as the Civil War, Lincoln&apos;s presidency, the Indian wars, Buffalo Bill, Wild Bill Hickok, ethnic relationships, cattle trailing and railway history in a span of little over two hours - all with an absence of narrative strain still impressive today. Ford&apos;s skill in marshalling many disparate elements into one large canvas, successfully orchestrating history (proudly announced here as &apos;accurate and faithful in every particular&apos;) is one example why he was such an exemplary Western director.

 George O&apos;Brien plays Davy Brandon, whose father dreams of rails eventually crossing the continent. After setting out for the west, Brandon senior is killed by the evil Two Fingers (Fred Kohler). Years later Davy sets to work for Union Pacific, scouting for a short cut through Cheyenne territory that will ensure the success of the transcontinental link up. Aiming to prevent this are the dastardly forces of corrupt surveyor Jesson (Peter Chadwick) and half-breed Baumann (Kohler). Meanwhile, Davy discovers his childhood sweetheart Miriam (Madge Bellamy) is engaged to the disreputable Jesson. The rest, as they say, is history. 

Throughout Ford&apos;s career he was wont to use symbols to indicate the coming of progress in the West. In My Darling Clementine (1946) it was the social dance at the unfinished church. In Liberty Valance (1964) the desert flowers on Tom Doniphon&apos;s (Wayne&apos;s) coffin. The Iron Horse is dedicated to George Stevenson and, not unexpectedly, here it is the railway itself that represents the growth of civilisation. Its ultimate success as an enterprise is less that of a profitable commercial venture than of beneficial ideal, as visualised by President Lincoln. 

Amidst the idealism of railway expansion, Ford includes the broad comedy common to many of his films - the Irish and Italian labourers continuing a friendly rivalry. Their work songs, spelt out in caption cards while they construct the track, punctuate the action, creating convenient breathing spaces between more dramatic scenes. The &apos;three musketeers&apos; - as Slattery (Francis Powers) Casey (Farrell Macdonald) and Schultz (Jim Welch) are called - have their own amusing scenes based around some frontier dentistry. But essentially they function as a kind of comic chorus, their earthy, ethnic interjections keeping the film&apos;s idealism down to earth. There&apos;s an element of this too in Judge Haller (James Marcus), a Roy Bean character, whose dispensation of frontier justice is as arbitrary as it is often inspired. 

Least convincing to the modern viewer is the character of Miriam, whose simpering virginity comes closest to the two-dimensional women found often in the world of D.W. Griffith&apos;s melodramas. Her condemnation of the clean living Davy&apos;s visit to the saloon, immediately after being with her (where, ironically, he has gone to patch things up with Jesson) seems almost wilfully annoying; ludicrous even, given the rough environment in which she finds herself. But that her heart belongs to the muscular scout is never in doubt, a fact made clear by their rapport in the opening scenes set in their childhood. In addition, once she has gained womanhood, her pending relationship with Jesson is condemned by implication as President Lincoln looks askance at their match. The same dramatic shorthand is employed through the palpable tension when Davy and Baumann first meet, an impending confrontation telegraphed as sharply as any message sent by mechanical means. 

There is also a intense psychological antipathy between Davy and Jesson, notably in the standout barroom scene. In these moments O&apos;Brien plays well, almost making one forget Ford&apos;s great films with Wayne to come. But, by necessity, this is principally a film of the great outdoors where Ford excels in portraying man battling against external obstacles, rather than facing internal stress. In his Stagecoach (1938), which was to later revitalise the genre, it would be a different story, one of comparative intimacy. Here, the heroes and villains who react together along the railroad work out their differences in the open air with grand gestures, fisticuffs and work songs, rather than anguished conversation. And it is these epic scenes that remain in the mind when the film is done. The attack of the Indians on the supply train, their furious shadows thrown against the sides of the carriages; the snow swept work camps; the many panoramas of frontier life; Davy and Bauman&apos;s final conflict in the sleeper &apos;house&apos;; the final meeting at Promontory Point for the &apos;wedding of the rails&apos;, and so on.

 Such visual grandness does not preclude economy however. One only has to think of hurriedly arranged burial of &apos;the old soak&apos; and the marriage held at North Platte, or the establishing scenes at the beginning of the film, to see how Ford was fully in command of his material, switching scale and focus with ease. 

With the joining of the two railroads and the closing of the bond between Miriam and Davy, there is a natural conclusion to both the human, and the mechanical elements of the story - Davy actually waits until the final spike has been driven home before committing himself to her side. Thematically, Fritz Lang was to acknowledge a debt to Ford&apos;s classic in his Western Union (1938), which has a related story, but his film is the slighter of the two and less innocent. Ford&apos;s epic remains the definitive telling of these particular events and its authenticity can still be recommended today.",,"['Drama', 'History', 'Romance']","['springfield illinois', 'national film registry', 'reference to ulysses s. grant', 'transcontinental railway', 'transcontinental railroad']",1925-10-04,['John Ford'],"['George O&apos;Brien', 'Madge Bellamy', 'Charles Edward Bull']","['Charles Kenyon', 'John Russell', 'Charles Darnton']"
Iron Man,"After being held captive in an Afghan cave, billionaire engineer Tony Stark creates a unique weaponized suit of armor to fight evil.","In my attempt to rewatch all the MCU-movies chronologically I began with the first Iron Man. To cut to the chase: it&apos;s still good. A couple of things astonished me, though:

First of all, a common mistake of the later Marvel-movies isn&apos;t made here. There is actually some sort of character development visible. Tony ends the movie as a totally different person. Of course, in an origin story it&apos;s easier to have your protagonist change but let&apos;s compare for a second: Is Ant-man really a changed man at the end of the movie? What about Star Lord? What about Thor? Black Widow? Hawkeye?

Then again, you have to give it to the director that he really made a well-paced, well-balanced movie. There is action, humour, drama, world establishing, all in great balance. The final fight isn&apos;t stretched too long and therefore doesn&apos;t get boring. You can&apos;t underestimate this in our age of 45 mins battles at the end of movies.

During my re-watch I also noticed how &apos;down to earth&apos; this movie is if you compare it to some of the more recent MCU-entries. It just looks more real than them. It&apos;s set in a world that at least COULD be real which makes us care more for the characters and their actions. More explosions and obvious cgi-effects don&apos;t improve a movie. So the movie doesn&apos;t feel as bloated as some other superhero flicks.

Finally, Iron Man is still fun to watch and not just a vehicle to set up a franchise. If you&apos;ve spent the last couple of years on the moon and haven&apos;t seen any of the MCU-movies, give this a try.",8,"['Action', 'Adventure', 'Sci-Fi']","['billionaire', 'inventor', 'robot suit', 'based on comic', 'marvel cinematic universe']",2008-05-02,['Jon Favreau'],"['Robert Downey Jr.', 'Gwyneth Paltrow', 'Terrence Howard']","['Mark Fergus', 'Hawk Ostby', 'Art Marcum']"

The relationship between Pepper and Tony is taken further and built upon brilliantly in this movie. It contains some really cool and innovative action scenes which are taken for granted now.

When they try to leave the cemetery, they&apos;re unable to find a way out. Increasing panic spirals downward into insanity. Death, the fear thereof, and superstitious dread are explored.

Make no mistake, &apos;It Came from Beneath the Sea&apos; is one of the classics of the genre and as such is above the mundane criticism about poor script, narrative, performances etc. We all know that these monster-flicks from the 50&apos;s and 60&apos;s had their shortcomings, but they were made to a formula for a target audience and in this respect there is little to fault and much to commend.

Here we have a giant octopus, disturbed from it&apos;s Pacific lair by atomic testing, heading for San Francisco in a foul mood. The Harryhausen effects are great, the narrative follows a course of some scientific logic and Faith Domergue, if a little too old, looks good enough in her tight blouse.

Director Robert Gordon did little else of note which is surprising - he did a good enough job here and whilst not up to the standard of &apos;20 Million Miles to Earth&apos; (1957), &apos;It Came from Beneath the Sea&apos; is still superior for its type.

It Came from Outer Space,A spaceship from another world crashes in the Arizona desert and only an amateur stargazer and a schoolteacher suspect alien influence when the local townsfolk begin to act strangely.,"Jack Arnold directed this screen version of Ray Bradbury&apos;s short story, `The Meteor&apos;, about a crashed spaceship in the mid-western desert. The alien crew kidnaps several inhabitants of the local town and assumes their form. A writer of science articles (Richard Carlson) who lives on the outskirts of the town witnesses the crash, although he thinks it&apos;s just a meteorite. When he goes down into the smoking crater, he sees the open hatchway of the spaceship and an alien creature within it, but when the alien closes the big hatch it starts a landslide in the crater which covers the ship. Afterwards none of the local authorities will believe Carlson&apos;s story about a buried spaceship filled with alien invaders.

A moody and beautiful movie, with fine music by Henry Mancini. Many fans of Jack Arnold&apos;s sci-fi films consider this one his best (although personally I prefer `The Space Children&apos; -- and so did Jack Arnold, according to his own statement).

Charles Drake (`Tobor the Great&apos;) is the skeptical sheriff. Russell Johnson plays both a human and an alien (a treat for genre&apos; fans). The supporting cast includes Joe Sawyer and Kathleen Hughes. Special effects by David S. Horsely and the great Clifford Stine. Makeup by Bud Westmore, of the famous Westmore family who contributed much to all the `Star Trek&apos; spin-offs.

It Happened One Night,"A renegade reporter trailing a young runaway heiress for a big story joins her on a bus heading from Florida to New York, and they end up stuck with each other when the bus leaves them behind at one of the stops.","IHON rightly earns it&apos;s place as one of the greatest romantic comedies in film history. A pioneer of the screwball comedy genre, it holds up very well 71 years after it was made.

It&apos;s a classic tale of the battle of sexes- something that is still so relevant today. We follow the story of spoiled heiress Ellie Andrews (Claudette Colbert), who jumps ship from her father&apos;s yacht (literally!) in Florida after an argument with said father (played by Walter Connolly) over her marrying wealthy playboy King Westley (Jameson Thomas) without her father&apos;s consent. Ellie is on a mission- to get to New York to King Westley. But how will she do it? That&apos;s how Peter Warne (played by a delightfully handsome Clark Gable) comes into the story. Recently fired from his newspaper job, Peter meets Ellie on the Night Bus to New York, and, realizing who she is (Her story is all over the news, after all!), offers to help her get to NY and Westley if she gives him an exclusive story- to win him back his job. And so the fun begins. Colbert and Gable have great chemistry as the mismatched couple thrown together after a series of unusual circumstances. The trip isn&apos;t a smooth one- and we are taken on a wild ride with Peter and Ellie, which gives us great scenes such as the doughnut-dunking lesson, Walls Of Jericho and the now-classic hitchhiking scene. The humour is still fresh and fast-paced over 70 years later. Oops, I almost forgot the classic &apos;no undershirt scene&apos; where Gable sexily gives Colbert a lesson in how a man undresses, to reveal (shock horror!) no undershirt, but a bare chest! This had a bad effect on the sales of men&apos;s undershirts, which dropped dramatically after the film&apos;s release (One of the first examples of product placement in film). Great supporting characters, particularly the scene-stealing Oscar Shapeley (Roscoe Karns). Of course it has it&apos;s faults- all early talkies do. But any faults are outweighed by the great story. Technically, it was well-made for it&apos;s time.

IHON won 5 Oscars- Best Picture, Best Director (Frank Capra), Best Actress and Best Actor for Colbert and Gable and Best Adaptation. It deserved all of them. Funnily enough, both Colbert and Gable didn’t want any part in the film at first- I bet they changed their viewpoint after the surprise success and the prestigious Academy Awards they gained for it. It&apos;s been said that a number of Disney characters like Bugs Bunny, Yosemite Sam and Pepe LePew were inspired by characters in this film. A classic, a must-see, a great movie.",10,"['Comedy', 'Romance']","['bus', 'reporter', 'spoiled brat', 'haystack', 'journalism']",1934-02-22,['Frank Capra'],"['Clark Gable', 'Claudette Colbert', 'Walter Connolly']","['Robert Riskin', 'Samuel Hopkins Adams']"

It&apos;s Alive,"The Davises expect a baby, which turns out to be a monster with a nasty habit of killing when it&apos;s scared. And it&apos;s easily scared.","Director Larry Cohen creates a thoughtful script about the effects of our environment on our reproductive systems in this thoroughly predictable yet immensely entertaining film. A father and a mother expecting rush to the hospital to have their second child. The only snag is that when the baby comes out of the womb it has razor-sharp fangs and claws with which it kills every doctor and nurse in its reach before fleeing the scene. The special effects are nothing too special, particularly by today&apos;s standards, but the film is full of insights and revelations as to what may be someday as we abuse our environment and use chemicals to sustain life. The father has a conversation in the waiting room with other expecting fathers. This conversation covers the ill-effects of pesticides, drugs, and other additives we use in our daily lives. The film uses the baby as a means to move action. With a distorted camera lens, we see things in the world through the eyes of this mutated infant. Initially the father wants to kill his beastly progeny. The police want to pump it full of lead. The doctors and drug companies want it destroyed to negate any possible backlash. A university professor wants the carcass for study when captured. Cohen shows us the underbelly of humanity. The people surrounding this infant are often no better than the child. All they want is gain...and it matters not at whose cost. John Ryan plays the introspective dad and does a fine job with this rather difficult role. He plays an ad executive who begins seeing the good in things and then slowly sees only the stark horror of his own life, his family life, his job, and his child. The other actors all do credible jobs. Cohen obviously likes horror as he names the wife Lenore and has the father talk at length about the novel Frankenstein. The production values and budget are minimal, but the film has a lot of heart where it counts.",,"['Horror', 'Sci-Fi']","['body horror', 'rampage', 'villain', 'claim in title', 'motherhood']",1974-09-28,['Larry Cohen'],"['John P.

He remembered being asked by some publicist why he did such dangerous things. He replied that he looked down from the great height, imagined he saw his pay check lying there, and took off! I suggested that he should write his memoirs. He said he had started and had spent a long time writing it all out by hand and had almost finished when his manuscript was stolen from, if I remember correctly, his car.

Jack the Giant Killer,A farmboy-turned-knight must protect a princess from the schemes of an evil wizard.,"Kerwin Matthews and Torin Thatcher virtually repeat their roles in Jack the Giant Killer that they had previously done for Columbia&apos;s 7th Voyage of Sinbad four years earlier. It was no wonder that Columbia sued United Artists and producer Edward Small over this.

Even without special effects master Ray Harryhausen, the film is not bad in that department at all. For the juvenile viewers even today, they will have goosebumps over the witches, monsters, and giants that our intrepid hero Jack has to overcome.

I do like the fact that Kerwin Matthews, Torin Thatcher, and the rest of the cast play their roles with absolute sincerity. It would not have been appropriate to do it otherwise in a film meant for kids of all ages.

The plot is simple, evil prince Torin Thatcher has designs on young princess Judi Meredith and tries one scheme with a giant to capture her and spirit her away to his evil enchanted island. He and confederate Walter Burke are foiled by a brave peasant lad named Jack who slays the giant. 

King Dayton Lummis makes Kerwin Matthews as Jack his daughter&apos;s protector and they have quite a few adventures before the happily ever after ending the fairy tale requires.

It&apos;s still a pretty good family film and a nice bit of nostalgia for folks like me who were kids when it did come out.",7,"['Adventure', 'Family', 'Fantasy']","['sea voyage', 'genie', 'character name as title', 'jack the giant killer character', 'psychotronic film']",1962-06-13,['Nathan Juran'],"['Kerwin Mathews', 'Judi Meredith', 'Torin Thatcher']","['Orville H.

Besides the frenetic battle with the skeletons and the seemingly hopeless fight against the statue of Talos? I like the way the people are presented, I suppose...

Heracles is presented, not as a young ripped body builder, but as one would expect a middle-aged strong man to be: Formidable, a little grey and a little swaggering. Argos, the ship builder, is tan and fat, as one would expect the veteran of many sea voyages to be. The crew looks like what one would expect a crew of ancient greeks to look like.

The acting is not spectacular, but sincere. No one looks embarrassed to be in this movie. It is tight with great special effects...wonderful for children...

And, I must mention Hera, normally portrayed as a matronly and vindictive woman, is here presented as a beautiful and helpful goddess by Honor Blackman, no less.

As part of the series, well, lets just say there is a lot to complain about, but on its own - its not bad. Certainly has a bit more personality than the other films. It felt a bit like Freddy Part 6 but made less sense!

Jason X,"Jason Voorhees is cryogenically frozen at the beginning of the 21st century, and is discovered in the 25th century and taken to space.

I saw this movie in the video store 11 years ago when I was in high school I saw the VHS cover of the film and I saw it on DVD. So finally I got this film on Blu-ray disc just finish it watching it today and I must say it is not a bad film I like it a lot. Like I said it is a guilty pleasure of mine. I know a lot of people hate this film I don&apos;t. I think is MILES way better then Jason Goes to Hell and Miles way better movie then Hellraiser: Bloodline that was in outer space this movie is just better.

7.years ago when I become a fan of Supernatural I heard that Jared Padalecki will be in the reboot Friday the 13th movie I rushed to see this movie. I watch Friday the 13th the original, Friday the 13th Part 2, the (2009) reboot and this film Jason X and yes I like it.

I thought this movie will copy Alien and Aliens but it didn&apos;t copy any of those films it was solid and it was original it had his own story. I didn&apos;t thought this movie was bad I thought it was an interesting story that had a good action and a good slasher kills.

Lexa Doig was an alright as the final girl tough it was a science fiction film it was still good and I will still watching it. Lexa Doig was in The Tracker with Casper Van Dien and I liked that action film I haven&apos;t seen in a while.

Jason Voorhees returns with a new look, a new machete, and his same murderous attitude as he is awakened on a spaceship in the 25th century.

Lexa Doig worked in facility Crystal Lake in which they capture Jason Voorhees but he kills everyone and escapes but Rowan Lafontaine (Lexa Doig) freeze him and her self in 2008. The year is now 2455 and a new crew members on a ship unfroze those two only too realize they unfroze Jason Voorhees unstoppable killing machine. Now a new group of soldiers tries to defeat Jason who later becomes Uber Jason.

Lisa Ryder was great, sexy and really hot as Kay-Em 14 I liked her, she really kicked Jason&apos;s ass and she shot him to death ha ha.

So it is scary? No. Is it a good movie? No. Is it fun? VERY.

I also forgot this movie is reference to Demolition Man (1993) my all time favorite futuristic action Stallone film. In which they were mention to Lexa Doig&apos;s character that she was in Cryo it references to Cryo-prison it is similar to Demolition Man.

Jason X is a 2001 American science fiction slasher film produced and directed by James Isaac. It is the tenth installment in the Friday the 13th film series and stars Kane Hodder in his fourth and final film appearance as the undead mass murderer Jason Voorhees and his futuristic counterpart, Uber Jason.

This movie get&apos;s a C+ 6/10 wasn&apos;t that bad of a film but wasn&apos;t a great Jason slasher film either, but still it is my all time favorite guilty pleasure of mine.

I have enjoyed this movie and I had fun watching it. Honestly I have enjoyed this movie much more then I did Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan but that is just my opinion It is my favorite guilty pleasure of mine.",6,"['Action', 'Horror', 'Sci-Fi']","['female doctor', 'autopsy', 'slasher killer', 'serial teen murderer', 'survival horror']",2002-04-26,['James Isaac'],"['Kane Hodder', 'Lexa Doig', 'Jeff Geddis']","['Todd Farmer', 'Victor Miller']"

Jaws 2,Police chief Brody must protect the citizens of Amity after a second monstrous shark begins terrorizing the waters.,"Four years on from the events of &apos;Jaws&apos; the population of Amity Island have got on with their lives; the tourists have returned and they don&apos;t want to think about sharks. Then a couple of divers go missing and two women are killed in a &apos;boating accident&apos;; Chief Brody is in charge of the investigation and after the body of a killer whale, complete with bite marks, washes up he is convinced that there is another great white shark in the waters round the island but the town council doesn&apos;t believe his claims. Then a group of youngsters, including Brody&apos;s sons, go out sailing... inevitably they have a run in with the shark and Chief Brody will have to take to the water again to try to save them.

Not surprisingly this isn&apos;t as good as the original film; that would have been very difficult. It is however pretty good. There are plenty of scary moments, certainly more than I expected in a UK-PG rated film. It starts well with the divers being killed as they explore the wreck of the Orca, the boat from the first film, and follows that up with an impressive explosion. We then get the chief&apos;s fears not being believed which did feel like a bit of a rerun of what happened in the first film. Things get better again when the youngsters sail into danger; the shark may be shown a bit too much and it looks no more realistic than that in &apos;Jaws&apos; but the young actors do look genuinely terrified which helps make it acceptable. The cast is decent enough although Roy Scheider stands out with his fine performance as Chief Brody. Overall I&apos;d definitely recommend this to fans of the original.",7,"['Adventure', 'Horror', 'Thriller']","['giant shark', 'wet t shirt', 'fictional town', 'shark', 'beach']",1978-06-16,['Jeannot Szwarc'],"['Roy Scheider', 'Lorraine Gary', 'Murray Hamilton']","['Peter Benchley', 'Carl Gottlieb', 'Howard Sackler']"
Jaws 3-D,A giant thirty-five-foot shark becomes trapped in a SeaWorld theme park and it&apos;s up to the sons of police chief Brody to rescue everyone.,"I actually like this Jaws ok. I don&apos;t think it is a masterpiece or anything, but it is good if not taken to seriously. This one focuses on the Brodie boys who really went through a growth spurt. One (Dennis Quaid) works at a sea amusement park and this is where the shark attacks take place (this should alone tell you not to take the film to seriously). I actually saw this one at the theater too, so that helps to enjoy the film more as it was rather cool in 3-D and it is the only 3-D movie I have ever seen at the theater so maybe that is why I will always somewhat enjoy it. The plot is at a sea park like I said and first the team goes after this one shark that was rather puny, then you find out there is a bigger one out there. There are a couple of pretty good shark attack scenes and I loved the subplot of the people stuck in that pod underwater. This film isn&apos;t for everyone though seeing as how it is ranked as one of the worst so read other people&apos;s reviews before deciding to see it.",6,"['Adventure', 'Horror', 'Thriller']","['1980s', 'orlando florida', 'orlando', 'florida', 'orange county florida']",1983-07-22,['Joe Alves'],"['Dennis Quaid', 'Bess Armstrong', 'Simon MacCorkindale']","['Peter Benchley', 'Richard Matheson', 'Carl Gottlieb']"
Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back,,"For the record, I have not seen Kevin Smith&apos;s previous works, Clerks, Mallrats, Chasing Amy, or Dogma, which, I&apos;m almost positive, affected how I saw the movie, since Smith puts in so many in-jokes and references to his previous movies, I didn&apos;t get them, except for the blatantly obvious ones.

Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Kevin Smith) hang out in front of a convience store selling weed. When the get a restraining order, they find out that the comic starring their likenesses Bluntman and Chronic is being turned into a Miramax movie. However, they aren&apos;t being paid for it, so what to do? Travel cross-country to Hollywood from New Jersey to stop the movie from getting made, what else?

Crude, inappropriate, and extremely funny. If there&apos;s ever a movie that you should watch with your drinking friends and not with a date or family, this is the one! It has jokes about genetalia, bodily functions, innuendoes, and more, and I haven&apos;t laughed this hard at a movie for a long time. Call me immature, but I like this type of stuff, ones that actually have substance behind the crude jokes (not like Old School).

Mewes was f-ing hilarious, when he f-ing say the f-ing f-word every f-ing word. It has over 230 f-words along in this movie, with the total number of curses probably around 300. I have never heard so many, but I laughed. I&apos;m not ashamed to admit it: Mewes cracked me up, with his stylish arrogance and foul mouth. Smith, who was laconic for almost the entire film, expressed everything with his eyes, which were funny. There were more cameos than a movie of The Simpsons, with Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, George Carlin, Jamie Kennedy, Chris Rock, Tracy Morgan, Joey Lauren Adams, and many, many more.

There were many pot-shots of American movies. For instance, when Jay and Silent Bob meet a drug dealer played by Tracy Morgan, he says that Miramax accounts for about 75% of his income. Also, everyone on-screen looks at the camera when they mention, `No one would pay to see a Jay and Silent Bob movie,&apos; and when Ben Affleck says that one reason you do a picture is because you owe a friend a favor. As the Bluntman and Chronic movies premieres, someone says, `Well, it was better than Mallrats.&apos;

Are you easily offended? Does the mention of various body parts upset you? If you answered yes to either question, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back is not your movie. If you answered no, sit back and enjoy the ride!

I love the first two films because they are both scary and well made, but WOW, this film is GARBAGE. TRUST ME, this is coming from a HUGE JC fan! The film takes place between the 1st and 2nd movie, which is dumb because nobody wanted to see what happened between the 1st and 2nd movie. I wanted to see what happened after the 2nd movie, but even then, it&apos;s really confusing because the plot keeps jumping back and forth between all of these dumb characters. I couldn&apos;t tell if the film was set in the present day, in 2001, or in the 70&apos;s because of the craptastic pacing. There&apos;s even a scene where you can see a 2016 Chevy truck in a film that supposedly takes place in 2001. Speaking of pacing, there is none! Nothing happens in this movie and the film ends right when it should&apos;ve started! There are so many characters that the film gets lost in itself. The first film had Darry and Trish, simple and easy. The 2nd film had the athletes and a side-plot revolving around an angry father, but it was still easy to follow and well balanced. Here, we have an old lady getting visions from her dead son, then we have Sargeant Tubbs from the first movie, then we have the anti-Creeper gang, then we have some teenagers, then we have a country boy who has a crush on a girl, and said girl also gets her own storyline. All the characters are pointless and are not flushed out because the film is trying so hard to give equal focus to everyone. The CGI is SO BAD and is EVERYWHERE in the film. It&apos;s so bad that my theater was laughing louder than the actual movie! The Creeper doesn&apos;t do ANYTHING, no smelling fear, eating body parts, he just sorta walks around and grunts. There&apos;s one good scene where a group of teenage bikers finds The Creepers truck in the woods, and it&apos;s the only good scene in the entire film. That&apos;s it! Worst of all, WE STILL DON&apos;T KNOW THE CREEPERS&apos;S ORIGINS!!! I&apos;ve been waiting nearly 2 decades and we STILL DON&apos;T KNOW WHERE HE COMES FROM??? The film ends on a cliffhanger but I do not want a 4th movie.

The pietist movements of the early 19th century are brought back to life and even modern, agnostic viewers can begin to understand what power the pietist preachers had among their followers.

Joe,"An ex-con, who is the unlikeliest of role models, meets a 15-year-old boy and is faced with the choice of redemption or ruin.","There&apos;s a quote about midway through David Gordon Green&apos;s Joe that I believe is crucial to understanding the film&apos;s thematic core. Forgive me if I&apos;m paraphrasing but it goes something like &apos;These men have no more frontiers&apos;. The line is in reference to the men Joe works with and in many ways applies to the titular character himself. Joe is a man that knows he is stuck; he has no where to go because his surroundings can&apos;t let him. Even though he thinks five steps ahead of the average man it is only delaying the inevitable. The conflict of the story however is not whether or not Joe lives but if he can save the future of a promising child, named Gary.

Joe is the kind of film that proves that a small story can be much more meaningful than a larger one. This kind of unsentimental character piece needs a small tight focus so all of the nuances of said characters shines through. Thankfully David Gordon Green understands this; his approach to directing the film is subtle and organic, allowing the actors to shine first and foremost. There are some understated flourishes and several instances of visual poetry but for the most part Green keeps things taut and unsentimental. He wants the audience to be immersed in the volatile world Gary and Joe inhabit.

And what a convincing world it is. Green&apos;s depiction of Southern lower class Americana is unsentimental, austere and straightforward. The film doesn&apos;t feel the need to overemphasize aspects of these characters live. Nothing is glamorized, nothing romanticized; the film aims for a hard hitting depiction of the character&apos;s world which only serves to further highlight the core conflict. Green understands that the audience needs to understand how close Gary and his sister are to harm and in doing so has crafted a thoroughly realized community teeming with details and nuances.

But the real centerpiece of the film is it&apos;s acting; three performances in particular stick out. Cage&apos;s Joe, Sheridan&apos;s Gary and Gary Poulter&apos;s Wade. Cage&apos;s depiction of Joe is not quite the subdued performance many critics made it out to be. Instead it is a silent colossus of a performance. One of Cage&apos;s biggest strengths as an actor is the ability to convey a character&apos;s thought process without saying a word. He makes a perfect fit for Joe; a man who is always moving, thinking, never given to slowing down. He is a frank straightforward man and Cage does the character justice. Equally excellent is Sheridan&apos;s Gary. Coming off his sterling performance in Mud, Sheridan proves himself one of the most promising actors of the younger generation. He brings balances both the character&apos;s more mature and intelligent feelings and ambitions with a raw, primal rage that surfaces in a truly explosive manner. Finally we have Gary Poulter, the dark horse of this movie. A non-actor Poulter was hired due to his similarity to the character he was portraying. And boy does he nail it. Seething with a kind of disheveled rage, imbued with a selfish nostalgic anger for a time he had a future; Wade is a truly terrifying character only made more terrifying by Poulter&apos;s raw, thoroughly convincing performance. If Joe is symbolizes a man in societal stagnation, Wade is that stagnation taken to it&apos;s logical, horrific end.

Joe is a gritty, hard movie about gritty hard people but it&apos;s also intelligent, heartfelt and riveting from the first frame to the last. It solidifies the comeback for David Gordon Green as a unique presence in American cinema and hopefully is a sign that Cage will do more of these kinds of austere, gripping character pieces more often in the future.

I had not read the book previously and knew nearly nothing about the story, but if you&apos;ve seen the trailer, that is pretty much adequate preparation for the strangeness you subject yourself to as you watch this movie. 

Several scenes are just outright setups for jokes, and if this film was just set em up, knock em down - it would not be worth an 8.

Johnny Guitar,"After helping a wounded gang member, a strong-willed female saloon owner is wrongly suspected of murder and bank robbery by a lynch mob.","Vienna (Joan Crawford) is a woman with an unknown past, who built a saloon in an area outside town, waiting for the railroad, which would pass nearby her bar. She has a great enemy, the evil Emma Small (Mercedes McCambridge), who wants to expel Vienna from that place. The reason for the dispute is the love for Dancin&apos; Kid (Scott Brady), a handsome man. The simple guitar player Johnny &apos;Guitar&apos; Logan (Sterling Hayden) arrives in the bar, invited by Vienna, to work with her. The locals are not aware that Johnny was the former lover of Vienna and a famous gunman. When Dancin&apos; Kid and his partners rob the local bank, Emma finds a motive to accuse and chase Vienna. 

This movie is an excellent and very feminist western. The story is different from most of other movies of this genre and based on the rivalry of the two lead actresses. I do not recall any other western movie having such powerful roles for women. The DVD released by the Brazilian distributor Versátil is wonderful, being totally restored and re-mastered, highlighting the marvelous colors of the costumes of Joan Crawford. Mercedes McCambridge has an outstanding performance in the role of a very mean and powerful woman. My vote is nine.

Joyeux Noël,"In December 1914, an unofficial Christmas truce on the Western Front allows soldiers from opposing sides of the First World War to gain insight into each other&apos;s way of life.","I was looking forward to finding out how this historical yet forgotten event would be put to film, and how accurately it would be depicted. I am not disappointed. This evokes emotion without ever slipping into sentimentality or sap. It personalizes without robbing the true occurrence of attention. There is focus put on certain characters(all of which are quite well-written), but never to the point of such being lost on what really happened. The plot is great, and develops well. Some liberties are taken with the story, and they are not all justified, but the core is kept intact, and this manages to both tell what happened and make us feel and care about it. The overdubbed singing could have been subjected to better synchronization, but there is little to any criticisms directed at the acting itself. The same goes for the production value. The technical aspects of this are excellent, as well. The cinematography and editing are just about flawless. Pacing is rather good. Writing and directing are commendable. All three sides each speak the actual languages, adding to the already well-established sense of realism. I recommend this to anyone interested in the period, and the specific situation in particular. 8/10",8,"['Drama', 'History', 'Music']","['truce', 'world war one', 'soldier', 'christmas', 'no man&apos;s land']",2005-11-09,['Christian Carion'],"['Diane Kruger', 'Benno Fürmann', 'Guillaume Canet']",['Christian Carion']
Joysticks,"When a top local businessman and his two bumbling nephews try to shut down the town&apos;s only video arcade, arcade employees and patrons fight back.","Joe Don Baker (along way from his Walking Tall glory days, he&apos;d bounce back though) plays Joseph Rutter a father who is mad that his daughter is always hanging out at the local video arcade. He crusades to shut it down, but the management and the other local arcaders have something to say about that. Cue &apos;hijinks and misadventures&apos; and gaming contests. This movie can and will trick you into thinking it&apos;s going to be a fun, if totally guilty pleasure, film at the beginning. The opening theme song is amazingly memorable in that &apos;80&apos;s kitchy kind of way that you can&apos;t help but smile. The first, I don&apos;t know, maybe 10 minutes seem to reinforce that you&apos;ll be in for a forgotten classic of teen sex movies of yesterday. But then it goes wrong, horribly wrong. The jokes turn stale, everyone involved grows slightly more stupid (not that they were anywhere close to MENSA members before, but you know what I mean) And the movie just loses pretty much everything it may have had going for it, ceasing to be fun or even entertaining. I really wonder if there will ever be a good film centered around video games (in all likelihood not, but one can dream)

Ju-on,A mysterious and vengeful spirit marks and pursues anybody who dares enter the house in which it resides.,"With obvious homages to Ring, The Grudge could be accused of an element of plagiarism. That doesn&apos;t, however, detract from the fact it&apos;s a pretty decent picture, and one of the better Tartan Asia Extreme movies.

First things first - I *love* Ring, and of course, I mean the Japanese original. That film is by far and away the greatest horror flick ever devised and goes above and beyond what I ever expected a movie to do. However, it also instigated a ready conveyor belt of substandard imitators from the same shores ready to cash in on this unique success. Dire nonsense like the hollow Dark Water, the dull and over stylised Eye, the truly pitiful Phone and the slightly bizarre Audition haven&apos;t truly come close to the level of Ring.

Now, while Grudge isn&apos;t quite up there with the very best horror films, as far as these Asian efforts go, it&apos;s definitely one of the more effective selections.

Megumi Okina is Rika, a volunteer homehelper. On being assigned to a family whose regular assistant is temporarily unavailable, she encounters the mother of the family who seems unresponsive. However, after a disturbing incident at the family home, Rika finds herself seemingly haunted by some kind of entity and everyone who gets involved in the case seems to endure the same trauma.

It&apos;s a slightly convoluted story to explain, but it works pretty well on screen. As usual the Japanese acting is generally pretty bland, but a few loud screams certainly add colour.

The main &apos;bad guy&apos; seems to be some type of ghostly being, and while it doesn&apos;t utterly terrify, it definitely brings a few chills. The only real problem is we see too much of it, and not enough is left to our imagination ala Ring. This takes away a certain air mystery and fear. Moreover, the fact the entity resembles the symbolic Japanese girl with long black hair we&apos;ve come to expect in the likes of Ring and Dark Water slightly detracts from notions of originality.

However, this is redeemed by some pretty effective direction and camera-work, which aid to promote certain wrongness about what is going on.

Perhaps a few aspects don&apos;t altogether make complete sense, but there&apos;s enough style here to paper over such cracks.

Movies like this do go to show that when it comes to horror, the Far East have a handle over the Western world.

It&apos;s by no means the most brilliant horror I&apos;ve ever seen, but it&apos;s definitely not bad and if you&apos;re up for a chill or 2, you could do far worse.",,['Horror'],"['shower', 'ghost boy', 'ghost child', 'ghost', 'bad guy wins']",2003-01-25,['Takashi Shimizu'],"['Megumi Okina', 'Misaki Itô', 'Misa Uehara']",['Takashi Shimizu']

Jules et Jim,Decades of a love triangle concerning two friends and an impulsive woman.,"Time and revisionist critics have tried to tarnish the gleam of Truffaut&apos;s final masterpiece - citing its apparent misogyny and apoliticism; but for some of us, &apos;Jules et Jim&apos; is the unforgettable film that opened the gates to both European film, and the great masters of American cinema like Hitchcock, Hawks and Ray. 

&apos;Jules et Jim&apos; is, along with &apos;Citizen Kane&apos;, THE vindication of the pleasures of cinematic form: the first half especially, in its rush of narrative registers and technical exuberance, is unparalleled in modern film. This isn&apos;t mere trickery - the use of paintings, books, plays, dreams, conversations, documentary footage, etc., as well as the different ways of telling a story through film, all point to the movie&apos;s theme - how do you represent people and the world in art without destroying them? Or is art the only to save people and life from extinction? 

 The foregrounding of theatricality, acting, disguises, pseudonyms, games, works-within-the-work, all point to the high modernism in which the film is set, when the old certainties about identity and place were being destroyed by the Great War. In fact the film could be considered Cubist in the way it uses film form to splice up and rearrange images, space, characters, viewpoints. 

Truffaut&apos;s film is a beautiful elegy about time: the historical time heading towards destruction in the shape of the Nazis, and the circular time of love, obsession and art. These times struggle in the film&apos;s structure, history zipping past years in the framing, Parisian sections, and days stretching out interminably in the central rural rondelay. 

 Far from being misogynistic, the film places Catherine&apos;s speech about &apos;grains of sand&apos; at its philosophical heart. AND she&apos;s played by Jeanne Moreau, the most honest and human of all great actresses.",10,"['Drama', 'Romance']","['marriage', 'french new wave', 'promiscuity', 'female psychopath', 'adulterous wife']",1962-01-23,['François Truffaut'],"['Jeanne Moreau', 'Oskar Werner', 'Henri Serre']","['Henri-Pierre Roché', 'François Truffaut', 'Jean Gruault']"

Julius Caesar,The growing ambition of Julius Caesar is a source of major concern to his close friend Brutus.

The Jungle Book,"After a threat from the tiger Shere Khan forces him to flee the jungle, a man-cub named Mowgli embarks on a journey of self discovery with the help of panther Bagheera and free-spirited bear Baloo.","Favreau&apos;s Jungle Book is a marvel. With a Spielbergian sense of magical awe and reverent fear, it&apos;s a children&apos;s epic that not only stands-up to its legacy, but surpasses it. Giant snakeskins, intense animal battles, and daring escapes from ape kingdoms give the film a scope beyond the animated musical, all while keeping intact its persistent joy. Funny, jaw-dropping, thrilling, grand, and fun, it&apos;s an all-cylinders-go cinematic experience on every level. The story of a young man-cub raised by wolves and living amongst the animals of the jungle hasn&apos;t changed much, down to the talking beasts. Much like last year&apos;s Cinderella, they utilize nostalgia of the beloved product to dive deeper into the story without cynically dismissing it. On top of immersing us into the wilderness through meticulous attention to the smallest of details, the characters are drawn with much more depth. The bratty and paper-thin Mowgli of yesteryear is replaced by a boy with brains and motivation. Played with wide-eyed confidence by newcomer Sethi, we emotionally engage with his adventure. And he&apos;s not alone; all characters are given loving attention, specifically the foreboding presence of scary-cool bruiser Sheer Khan. The technical feat of creating photo-realistic animals that convincingly speak and emote is so impressive it feels like a benchmark in CGI. It wouldn&apos;t be an overstatement to say this is as groundbreaking and beautiful as any visual effects in years. Favreau and co. manage intense attention to accuracy without shoving it down our throats or overshadowing the story. At the end of the day, under all the computer data, there is a soulful and entertaining tale about life&apos;s bare necessity: individuality within community.",8,"['Adventure', 'Drama', 'Family']","['jungle', 'human animal relationship', 'tiger', 'wolf', 'black panther']",2016-04-15,['Jon Favreau'],"['Neel Sethi', 'Bill Murray', 'Ben Kingsley']","['Justin Marks', 'Rudyard Kipling']"
Ultimo mondo cannibale,"An oil prospector is captured and imprisoned by a violent and primitive cannibal tribe in the Philippines&apos; rain forest. He manages to escape with a female hostage, and begins searching for his missing companion and their airplane.","Ruggero Deodato&apos;s name is forever linked with the cannibal movie genre mostly because of his infamous &apos;Cannibal Holocaust&apos;, a movie which I&apos;ve yet to see uncut. &apos;The Last Cannibal World&apos; (aka &apos;Jungle Holocaust&apos;) was his first cannibal movie, and isn&apos;t as well known or talked about. If you don&apos;t take it too seriously, and don&apos;t object too much to the gratuitous animal slaughter, it&apos;s sleazy, trashy entertainment. Deodato by the way didn&apos;t start this movie cycle, Umberto Lenzi did, but Lenzi later recycled some Deodato footage, and cast Ivan Rassimov and Me Me Lai in his &apos;Eaten Alive&apos;. Anyway, Massimo Foschi plays an American, Robert Walker. The plane he and his colleague Rolf (Rassimov) are traveling on crashes and they get separated in the jungle. I forget where the setting was supposed to be. It doesn&apos;t really matter as these cannibal movies are fantasies with no basis in reality. They usually film them in the Philippines and get the locals to wear dirty wigs and ham it up, which is alright by me if it&apos;s alright with them. It&apos;s a living, right? Walker gets caught by a primitive cannibal tribe, who tie him up, rip his clothes off and play with his penis. Maybe they are impressed, I don&apos;t know, but instead of eating him they imprison him. He witness all kinds freaky stuff while caged, but eventually escapes and takes Pulan, a beautiful local girl, as a hostage (Me Me Lai, also in Lenzi&apos;s &apos;Man From Deep River&apos;, made before this, and his &apos;Eaten Alive&apos;, made after). Their relationship is difficult to fathom and depends a lot on which cut of this movie you see. Walker is eventually reunited with his old pal Rolf and then decides to kick some cannibal butt. Really the plot is slim, and who cares? This is just an excuse to see lots of gross stuff and Me Me Lai&apos;s breasts. If I was forced to defend this type of movie I really couldn&apos;t, but hey, I enjoyed it while it lasted. My favourite cannibal movie is still Sergio Martino&apos;s unfairly dismissed &apos;Mountain Of The Cannibal God&apos;, starring Ursula Andress and Stacy Keach, which was released the year after this. It isn&apos;t as hardcore as the Lenzi and Deodato movies but it&apos;s lots of fun.",,"['Adventure', 'Horror']","['cannibal', 'pilot', 'tribe', 'fear', 'breasts']",1978-03-24,['Ruggero Deodato'],"['Massimo Foschi', 'Me Me Lai', 'Ivan Rassimov']","['Tito Carpi', 'Gianfranco Clerici', 'Renzo Genta']"
Jurassic Park,A pragmatic paleontologist touring an almost complete theme park on an island in Central America is tasked with protecting a couple of kids after a power failure causes the park&apos;s cloned dinosaurs to run loose.,"In the year 1993, Hollywood saw something unlike anything else, the film Jurassic Park. Never before 1993 had dinosaurs been so breathtaking and realistic on the silver screen.

The plot is very original. A group of scientists cloned dinosaurs, and are about to open an amusement park where people can see the dinosaurs. The creator John Hammond(Richard Attenborough) invites a group of people, along with his grandchildren, to see the dinos and enjoy a relaxing time at the park. Could anything go wrong, at the time it doesn&apos;t seem like it, but something else is going on. Employee Dennis Nedry is planning to steal dinosaur embryos. In order to do this, he causes a security breakdown so he can get the embryos and escape. He isn&apos;t the only one that can escape, as hungry dinos also escape. After this, everyone on the island is in danger, and loose dinosaurs are everywhere. That is where the fun in Jurassic Park comes in.

This is an underrated movie according to the IMDb ratings. It isn&apos;t even in the top 250. Today, people don&apos;t appreciate it as much, mainly due to the fact that other movies like it have been made. Growing up in the 90&apos;s, this was one of my favorite movies. As a kid, I only watched it to see the dinosaurs, as I didn&apos;t understand a whole lot of it. Today, I realize how great the plotting and suspense are.

This spawned two sequels. The second one wasn&apos;t bad, but the third wasn&apos;t very good. I would recommend seeing the second after this, but the third is passable.

The story is great, how at first we see how the magic was created, and then later we see the magic turn into a disaster, in which everyone&apos;s life is at stake.

The special effects are still good today, but they were revolutionary for back in 1993. The acting is good, and the ensemble cast is great. All of the action sequences are perfectly executed, creating plenty of suspense and tension.

Younger kids may get scared by this, as I remember a lot of young kids being scared by it in 1993. If kids aren&apos;t scared by dinosaurs, they will probably enjoy the movie.

I highly recommend Jurassic Park. It is quite underrated in my opinion, it deserves more credit than it gets.

Watch this at all costs if you have somehow missed it and see what everyone was amazed about back in 1993.

Jurassic World: Dominion,"Four years after the destruction of Isla Nublar, Biosyn operatives attempt to track down Maisie Lockwood, while Dr Ellie Sattler investigates a genetically engineered swarm of giant insects.","I don&apos;t know whether this is a fabled memory, but a few years ago I think I read an interview where director Colin Trevorrow said that the story of Dominion was always his ultimate go-to, that Jurassic World and Fallen Kingdom were the stepping stones to there (almost as if it was gathering the right build-up with characters, fan anticipation, budget, and technological advances). For every reason imaginable, I believed him. Where Fallen Kingdom ended, you had endless opportunity to explore the world with dinosaurs running amok and causing mayhem. Final shots of Fallen Kingdom included the T-Rex at a zoo, the Mosasaurus attacking surfers, a velociraptor overlooking a suburban California, and pterodactyls towering above a tourist-populated Las Vegas. It was all there; think The Lost World&apos;s San Diego epilogue but on a grander scale with more dinosaurs. Throw in the military, philosophical conversations regarding their eradication versus their survival, advance some more characters, and you have a bona fide fun summer blockbuster.

This didn&apos;t happen.

No matter what my actual opinion is of the film hereon out, I can&apos;t help but be letdown with disappointment that Trevorrow either deluded himself into believing this was the kind of conclusion that fans yearned for ala War for the Planet of the Apes (which has a much more compelling protagonist that makes it work despite its story misdirection) or J. A. Bayona pulled a Rian Johnson and put him in a corner with the concluding chapter that he had to rectify and had no actual written plan of his own. And it&apos;s not that there isn&apos;t a medium where this story doesn&apos;t work just fine. I can imagine the main plot elements being adapted from, say, a novelization or a comic series. Hell, there was even that Battle at Big Rock short that was done which could have told these elements on their own, or at the very least introduced them. Instead, they threw in extremely disjointed story bits for this final chapter that seemed to have no source of origin. They felt like they were the contrivance meant to unite our two character groups, and nothing more.

Dominion starts off very okay. It shows that it can slow down, have a genuine heartbeat, provide pathos for the existence of our reptilian brethren, trot the globe to see how they have integrated (or not) with our species, and reintroduce characters new and old (with possible internal conflicts) to show how they would pave their globetrotting paths. They even fix some of the poorly written aspects of Fallen Kingdom such as maturing Franklin&apos;s character, giving better use to the laser-targeting attack system, and giving Maisie a more believable backstory. All of this is supported with fantastic animatronic work and much improved CGI blending with it. I thought the visuals were mostly a knockout and supported the onscreen setups.

Not only that, but Sam Neill, Laura Dern, and Jeff Goldblum kindled a similar flame to their interactions in JP1 and you sat forward to watch those moments. I caught myself smiling quite a few times during those exchanges. Jeff Goldblum was especially used well as he was able to inject entertainment and comedy through his dialogue where the film otherwise was flat with on its attempts. They were not small cameo appearances and served crucial roles to the film. You buy where they are in their lives, and even though TLW and JP3 are retconned the actors clearly tapped into those experiences for their performances to accentuate their statuses.

Speaking of buy-in, I would have given this film a long leash on a lot of things they could have done or did with this movie. We hit the point where we can embrace the ridiculous in several places. Want to make Blue become Owen&apos;s pet and attack guard? Go right on ahead. Want to modernize the action and give our protagonists more ability and skill that you might see in the Fast & Furious franchise or with our human Marvel heroes? If the dinosaurs get their large share of the action as well, I&apos;m on board (the Malta scene is a perfect example of this). Want to pay homage to the previous films as you conclude your franchise? That is what I expect. I also expect them to diversify this on a tonal level where need be as to not become too stale, and I think I was feeling that here. Hell, there is nearly a half-hour duration where not a single dinosaur is shown or brought up, and if it&apos;s in anticipation for what is to come while building character or story then I will let it play out.

The problem really arose both when the movie decided to abandon the broad, peregrinating experience and confine its setting. Dominion is the saga&apos;s epic conclusion and did not need to put on this hat. This was a major rug pull from what was anticipated, and soured itself spending an excruciatingly long time on something that left little entertainment, tension, or dinosaurs. When they do show up, the moments become a little one-note. Our good guys have plot armor such as raptors that can run at vehicle speeds but can&apos;t catch up to running characters, or when they are cornered they just get roared at or ran/flown/swam past until they find their way out of the situation, or when they know they can stand around and trust that a carnivore won&apos;t eat them because reasons. Bryce Dallas Howard got the best/most suspenseful dino encounters at this stage of the film and they actually work extremely well, but for a near 150-minute movie these are few and far between, and for this franchise you really have to sit and ask yourself if there is a chance that she won&apos;t survive any of these instances.

A lot of this could have been made better if our Rexy got some great moments, but even she was backdropped and upstaged too often to matter, or when she does come on screen it seems to be a rehashed occurrence from something of old. She looked and sounded good, though. I want to restate how good the dinosaurs actually looked here, and I want to commend the visual effects departments for what they were able to do in that department. If there was a niggle I&apos;d have here, it would probably be in the weight of the raptor movement which felt too light and jittery. That probably only makes sense in my head, but the rest looked really good. If knowing that I would have to wait 21 years after 2001&apos;s Jurassic Park III to finally get the sequel with visuals that really soar, I would gladly take it. I just wish it was with a better film, or at least with a film that I would want to rewatch over and again. Instead, this left an aftertaste that makes me want to instead go and watch Top Gun: Maverick for a fourth time. Outside of demo material, I don&apos;t even know if I will be a completionist and get this on UHD a few months down the line. Normally one shouldn&apos;t fault a film for letting their own speculation become expectation, but in this particular instance I very much believe that you can. All signs and promotions hinted toward a different kind of movie and story, but despite the good parts it did have, this was too much of a misguided, ineffectual whimper.",4,"['Action', 'Adventure', 'Sci-Fi']","['dinosaur', 'tyrannosaurus rex', 'velociraptor', 'experiment gone wrong', 'locust']",2022-06-10,['Colin Trevorrow'],"['Chris Pratt', 'Bryce Dallas Howard', 'Laura Dern']","['Emily Carmichael', 'Colin Trevorrow', 'Derek Connolly']"

Kes,A working-class English boy spends his free time caring for and training his pet kestrel.,"This is a small, perfectly formed jewel of a film. Growing up in a similar small town, at the same time, in the north of England, I can vouch for its authenticity. The scenes and dialogue are very true to life: the paper round, morning assembly, the ordeal in the headmaster&apos;s office. The scrap in the playground, the fags behind the gym. Certainly I knew plenty of young lads like Billy Casper, though probably the circumstances weren&apos;t quite as grim as depicted - nobody I knew had to share a bed with an ogre of an older brother. The film is beautifully shot, with wonderful use of natural lighting, and very effective marrying of images to music. There are some great performances too: Brian Glover and Colin Welland have rightly passed into legend for their depiction of two very different teachers. Of course David Bradley is unforgettable, and dominates the story. The film has seeped into the consciousness of the group of friends I grew up with, and resonates still. Don&apos;t be put off by the subject matter; there are plenty of funny moments and overall the effect is to uplift the spirit.",9,"['Drama', 'Family']","['british new wave', 'working class', 'falcon', 'school', 'teacher']",1970-04-03,['Ken Loach'],"['David Bradley', 'Brian Glover', 'Freddie Fletcher']","['Barry Hines', 'Ken Loach', 'Tony Garnett']"
Kids in the Hall: Brain Candy,"A pharmaceutical scientist creates a pill that makes people remember their happiest memory, and although it&apos;s successful, it has unfortunate side effects.","Okay. Where to begin?

It&apos;s phenomenal. If you&apos;ve ever watched a single Kids in the Hall episode and caught yourself stifling a guffaw for you feared laughing at an orgasming, androgynous chicken-lady(?) might classify you as a lunatic, go see Brain Candy.

If you haven&apos;t experienced that, go see it anyways.

I personally think it&apos;s the some of the best modern comedic writing there is out there. The troupe collated their ability to create off-the-wall scenes with a Monty-Python-esque flair of weaving the same actors into decidedly varying roles, and thus spawned a seriously non-serious satire of man&apos;s eternal search for happiness.

I saw this movie first in the theater, and the odd things is, I didn&apos;t laugh once during the entire showing. The true hilarity of the flic hit me several hours later as a friend and I mused its elusive intricacies in a coffee shop. We were nearly falling out of our chairs with just the simple mentioning of many of the scenes.

I made a point of seeing it again, and have never regretted adding it to my &apos;all time favourite&apos; list.

Go see it.

Kilimanjaro: To the Roof of Africa,"Join a band of trekkers as they journey through rugged terrain and extreme conditions to look out from Africa&apos;s highest point in David Breashears&apos; mountain adventure, Kilimanjaro: To the Roof of Africa.","Kilimanjaro, the newest David Breashears (Everest) Imax film, documents the journey of 7 individuals, from various backgrounds and ages, as they challenge themselves in hopes of summiting the largest free-standing mountain in the world. The Imax is a little like National Geographic meets Survivor. At first you&apos;re awed by the natural beauty of Kilimanjaro and then, slowly, the film weaves in the story of the adventurous group and their expedition, lending a more human aspect to the documentary. The film is beautifully photographed and scored and the editing is top-notch. As the stories unfold, a type of picture-in-picture is used to show the climber speaking (in the foreground) as he or she is hiking in the background, utilizing the giant dome of the Imax theatre. This is an interesting and creative feature that lends a hand to the narration of Kilimanjaro. Overall, this film is very inspiring to the average Joe, delivering the message that although the climb to Kilimanjaro&apos;s summit is no picnic, it is however, possible (50% success rate).

Suor Omicidi,"Legendary Swedish sex bomb Anita Ekberg stars as Sister Gertrude, a cruel nun who discovers depraved pleasure in a frenzy of drug addiction, sexual degradation and sadistic murder.","Killer Nun is a crossover between two of sleaze cinema&apos;s most popular subgenres; the graphically titled &apos;nunsploitation&apos; and the more popular Italian thriller known as Giallo. I can&apos;t say I&apos;m very experienced with the former, but I&apos;m a big fan of the latter; and the fact that this film was a part of the Video Nasty list back in the eighties ensured that I had enough reason to see it. As a Video Nasty, this film isn&apos;t all that good and is unfortunately one of the more tame entries on the list, and to be honest; I can&apos;t see a good reason for banning it, other than the obvious implications of a nun taking it upon herself to begin killing people. As a Giallo, this film isn&apos;t all that good either - as there isn&apos;t a lot of mystery going on, and the murders aren&apos;t too imaginative. However, as a slice of sleaze; this film works a treat! The plot follows a nun who finds herself addicted to morphine after having an operation on a brain tumour. However, this isn&apos;t the most dangerous element of her psyche; as the patients at the hospital she works at believe that she is behind a series of murders! 

The film clearly knows what its main strengths are, and director Giulio Berruti delights in showing things such as lesbianism and torture to his audience. The idea of one of God&apos;s disciples going around murdering people isn&apos;t the most original idea ever conceived, but it&apos;s well worked as the film always appears to be completely serious and manages to stay away from the comic book styling&apos;s of many Giallo, which would ultimately have harmed the film. Cult actress Anita Ekberg takes the lead role and delivers a strong performance, which despite not winning her any plaudits; works well in the context of the movie, and she does carry off the nun look well. Joe Dallesandro joins in the fun, and the rest of the unknown cast are good enough for this sort of film. The lesbian scenes in the movie are well done and actually rather erotic, thereby guaranteed to delight the movie&apos;s target audience. The plot is always secondary to the sleaze, and therefore isn&apos;t too interesting; but it plays out nicely, and while the ending isn&apos;t particularly strong; this is a good example of sleaze cinema and is recommended to the relevant people.",7,"['Horror', 'Mystery', 'Thriller']","['female rear nudity', 'female full frontal nudity', 'hospital', 'addiction', 'torture']",1979-05-10,['Giulio Berruti'],"['Anita Ekberg', 'Alida Valli', 'Massimo Serato']","['Giulio Berruti', 'Enzo Gallo', 'Alberto Tarallo']"

Killer&apos;s Kiss,"Ready to catch a train to his hometown, a washed-up boxer tells us about the strange and twisty events that happened to him the past couple of days.","A severely underrated film-noir that turned out to be far more engaging than expected, Killer&apos;s Kiss is no masterpiece in my opinion but it did serve its purpose well as a warm up feature for director Stanley Kubrick&apos;s talents before he started churning out one masterpiece after another until the very end of his legendary film career & is as experimental as his other features.

The story revolves around Davey Gordon; a 29-year old boxer well past his prime, who&apos;s waiting at the train station for his girl and in an extended flashback recounts the happenings of his recent past. Filmed on a shoe-string budget, it presents Stanley Kubrick in charge of the responsibilities of director, cinematographer & editor all by himself, at which he impresses greatly.

The film employs many unconventional & new tricks of shooting a picture from start to finish and exhibits the remarkable eye for detail Kubrick has when it comes to camera placement & lighting. Editing also never lets the uncertainty go out of the story & music manages to fit its accompanying sequences rather well. Performance by the cast isn&apos;t anything special but every one chipped in fine in their given roles.

On an overall scale, Killer&apos;s Kiss is a very well crafted & firmly composed film which over the years has influenced cinema in a number of ways with its narrative structure & inventive use of camera angles. But since Kubrick went on to achieve even greater prominence in his later films, Killer&apos;s Kiss seems to be faced with no choice but to accept a rank provided at the back.

Kingu Kongu no gyakushû,"Inspired by the Rankin/Bass cartoon, the evil Dr. Who captures King Kong to dig for Element X when his mechanical doppelganger, Mechani-Kong, is unable to do the task. Kong escapes and soon confronts his mechanical double.","As it states under &apos;Trivia&apos;, &apos;King Kong Escapes&apos; was a tie-in to the Rankin-Bass &apos;King Kong&apos; cartoon series, and to be honest, this film is very much a children&apos;s movie, featuring a cartoonish super-villain, a faintly ridiculous plot and comical fight scenes. This shouldn&apos;t be taken to mean that I hate the film, however. While it&apos;s not as good as Toho&apos;s previous Kong outing, &apos;King Kong VS Godzilla&apos;, it&apos;s still okay if you&apos;re in the mood for that kind of thing. I&apos;ve never seen the cartoon, but the plot of this film is straightforward enough that you don&apos;t need to.

The film does have a number of flaws, the most notable being King Kong himself. I personally thought the ape suit from KKVG looked pretty impressive, but KKE&apos;s version is more than a little silly, particularly the face, with its wide, staring eyes and permanently open mouth, which makes Kong look like he&apos;s high. Also, the fights with the other monsters aren&apos;t overly impressive; the battle on Mondo Island (Kong had obviously moved from Skull Island after it was destroyed at the end of Son of Kong) with Gorosaurus is actually quite funny, particularly when Kong gets repeatedly drop-kicked, but the showdown with Mecha-Kong is a bit anticlimactic, particularly compared to the city-destroying smackdowns of KKVG and the best of the Godzilla series.

The plot is some silly gubbins about mining a radioactive element, and King Kong comes into the story after the evil Dr Who (not the time-travelling character from the long-running British T.V series) builds a robot ape, only for it to fail. He then kidnaps the real Kong, but he escapes (hence the title) and the usual Kaiju action ensues. The human element is rather bland, although this is probably the fault of the script rather than the actors. Linda Miller is the ersatz Fay Wray of this picture, her role generally consisting of being picked up by Kong and trying to save the big ape from getting into trouble. Rhodes Reason is solid if unspectacular, and Dr. Who makes a good, over-the-top villain.

Having said that, I do think it&apos;s a shame Toho never made any more Kong movies. Personally, I would have loved to have seen Mecha-Kong come back, perhaps in a Godzilla movie. Given that Godzilla battled so many monsters over the years, it might have been interesting if he had come up against King Kong again, maybe in a scenario that forced them to work together against one or more of the many monster that big G faced.",6,"['Action', 'Adventure', 'Family']","['giant ape', 'giant robot', 'mad scientist', 'nurse', 'king kong character']",1968-06-19,['Ishirô Honda'],"['Rhodes Reason', 'Mie Hama', 'Linda Miller']","['Takeshi Kimura', 'Edgar Wallace']"
King of Kings,"The temporary physical life of the Biblical Savior, Jesus Christ.","&apos;King of Kings&apos; features Jeffrey Hunter&apos;s finest performance, as a young, dynamic Jesus of Nazareth, and his interpretation, open and earnest, is the best part of a movie both uneven and flawed.

 Produced by many of the people responsible for &apos;Ben Hur&apos;, the film utilizes some of the same sets, actors (Frank Thring appears in major roles in both films), and composer (Miklos Rozsa, whose score for &apos;King of Kings&apos; was one of his finest). The cast was fleshed out by respected actors (Robert Ryan is too old but charismatic as John the Baptist, Siobhan McKenna is a glowing, if also too old Mary, Brigid Bazlen, a deliciously wicked and oversexed Salome, Harry Guardino, an &apos;over-the-top&apos; Barabbas, a VERY young Rip Torn scores as Judas). While the cast didn&apos;t have the &apos;star power&apos; of &apos;Ben Hur&apos;, or many other Christian epics, the actors, by and large, perform credibly in their roles, particularly Hurd Hatfield and Viveca Lindfors, as Pilate and his wife, Claudia, and Ron Randell as Tribune Lucius.

 The film was a MUCH less expensive project than &apos;Ben Hur&apos;; the budget restraints show most glaringly in recreating Jesus&apos; ministry (most of Christ&apos;s miracles are only referred to, not shown), and extras casting (non-professional Spanish townspeople, overdubbed with some truly RIPE dialog!).

 The film works best when focusing on Jesus; unfortunately, it frequently veers off into distracting subplots about Barabbas and the zealots, and the decadence of Herod&apos;s court. These stories consume a LOT of screen time, and damage the overall impact of the film.

 Yet rising above all this is Jeffrey Hunter&apos;s interpretation of the Savior. Easily the most audience-friendly of all the actors who have assailed the role, Hunter took a lot of flack for his &apos;matinee idol&apos; good looks, and piercing blue eyes, but his kindness, sincerity, and the complete believability with which he delivers Christ&apos;s words overcome any qualms about his appearance. The Sermon on the Mount is a film high point, and magnificent; the Crucifixion and Resurrection have the kind of power that can bring a lump to your throat, even after repeated viewings.

 While &apos;King of Kings&apos; lacks the big names and budget of &apos;The Greatest Story Ever Told&apos;, or the emotional core of &apos;Jesus of Nazareth&apos; or &apos;The Last Temptation of Christ&apos;, in Jeffrey Hunter, the film presents possibly the most compassionate of all screen Messiahs, and makes this film a very moving experience!",8,"['Biography', 'Drama']","['john the baptist character', 'jesus christ character', 'mary of nazareth character', 'mary magdalene character', 'joseph of nazareth character']",1961-10-30,['Nicholas Ray'],"['Jeffrey Hunter', 'Siobhan McKenna', 'Hurd Hatfield']","['Philip Yordan', 'Ray Bradbury']"
King Solomon&apos;s Mines,Fortune hunter Allan Quatermain teams up with a resourceful woman to help her find her missing father lost in the wilds of 1900s Africa while being pursued by hostile tribes and a rival German explorer.,"This is one of my favourite films, as it is so easy to watch, i think the director was being Padraic of other action/adventure films and that is why it appears cheesy. I think the areoplane scene which we can tell is really fake, is meant to make you laugh. I particularly like the way secretly Sharon Stone&apos;s shorts within the film start as clam diggers and by the end of the film she almost has hot pants on (typical Hollywood male gaze of woman). I think for that time the special effects were excellent for an action/adventure treasure hunter film.

Kull the Conqueror,A barbarian warrior becomes a king when he defeats a king in armed combat and the king&apos;s heir conspire to overthrow him and reclaim the throne by resurrecting an evil sorceress.,"The screenplay writer must have read Howard&apos;s book, since there are literal quotes like `By this axe I rule!&apos;, which Kull exclaims during the coronation, yet again, this movie is no serious attempt to capture the raw, barbarian spirit of Howard&apos;s heroes. `Kull the Conqueror&apos; reminds me of `Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger&apos; rather than `Conan the Barbarian&apos; or `Hercules&apos;. Exactly like Patrick Wayne, Kevin Sorbo has to sail to the Land of Ice to find a solution to his problem: the evil witch threatening the once peaceful kingdom. `Kull&apos; is nice, colourful adventure, Sinbad with more muscles and less charm, nothing special, but not as bad as some reviewers wrote, either. I&apos;ll watch it again on a rainy day. Of course, if you expected another `Conan the Barbarian&apos;, you&apos;ll be disappointed, but `Conan the Destroyer&apos; and `Red Sonja&apos; were no match for this masterpiece in the past, and `Kull&apos; is at least a bit better than these two.

 Tia Carrere as the red-haired witch Akivasha who cannot be killed, for she is living in a fire, is brilliant. Her immediate transition from the enchanting beauty to screaming rage compares to nothing. I still didn&apos;t figure out why Sorbo chose the same profession as De Niro and Dustin Hoffman, but he&apos;s passable here.

La figlia di Frankenstein,"Baron Frankenstein&apos;s daughter and his assistant/her lover continue his experiments in an attempt to rebuild his legacy after he is killed by his psychotic, murderous first monster.","Mel Welles, you might remember him as Mr. Mushnick in Roger Corman&apos;s Little Shop of Horrors, directs this somewhat interesting yet wholly twisted tale of Dr. Frankenstein&apos;s daughter carrying on her father&apos;s work after his death and creating a creature not for its intellectual ability or its likelihood to be/do good but rather for its sex appeal. You see, Tania Frankenstein, though a doctor and scientist in her own right, is concerned with really nothing more than satiating her primal desires for the stable boy and making some super sex slave by using his body with the excellent brain of a man she does not love. The story is tissue-thin here, and one gets what one might expect: lots of leering and suggestive comments(surprisingly most from the female lead), special effects that are not so special, acting that lacks depth of characterization, and not really much action or suspense. And while this film is almost barren in regards to good storytelling, Lady Frankenstein does oddly have some aspects which make it watchable - not highly watchable but watchable nonetheless. Italian actress Rosalba Neri AKA Sara Bay/Bey plays the Baron&apos;s daughter with some aplomb and lots and lots of sex appeal. She oozes desire and seduction quite well. Her performance is pretty one-dimensional, but she is quite lovely and plays over-the-top a little too well. She is also very open with her performance if you catch my drift. Poor Joseph Cotten, now regulated to European horror films for money, plays the father in a brief yet competent performance. He is the star attraction but gone before the film really kicks into a gear. As for the rest of the cast, Paul Muller is somewhat effective as Dr. Charles Marshall, the baron&apos;s assistant and an admirer of the daughter for some time. As crimes and missing persons begin to unfold in the village, policeman(I wasn&apos;t buying this)Mickey Hargitay starts to pump Tania for answers - despite what you might think not to her satisfaction. Where the movie really loses credibility is in the final third of the film where the suspect script, weak performances, and lackluster direction all head further South. The creature is revealed and looks quite ridiculous. The film ends somewhat abruptly with one of the hasty resolutions very common in the 1970s. While not nearly as bad and repulsive as some might want you to think, Lady Frankenstein is indeed a very flawed film with some perverse albeit intriguing overtones.",4,['Horror'],"['sex scene', 'interrupted sex', 'killed during sex', 'mental retardation', 'female frontal nudity']",,"['Mel Welles', 'Aureliano Luppi']","['Joseph Cotten', 'Rosalba Neri', 'Paul Muller']","['Dick Randall', 'Edward Di Lorenzo', 'Mel Welles']"
Lady in White,"An author tells the story of how, as a young boy growing up in a 1960s small town, he was haunted after witnessing the murder of a little girl.","Picture a sleepy rural community by the sea where children play in fields, family members work together and a ghost appears to a young boy to receive aid in finding peace. These are some of the story lines of Lady in White. the picture was directed by Frank LaLoggia and he gives it a picturesque Ray Bradbury kind of tone, mood, and setting. It was as if I were transported back into some aspects of my childhood as the film centers on the point of view of a young boy named Frankie Scarlatti. The story is not grandiose by any means: you will know the identity of the killer fairly quickly just by instincts. The real power of the film for me was the presentation of the film - the creepy moments with the Lady in White, Katherine Helmond as a crazed woman obsessed with candles, and the claustrophobic atmosphere of a little school room. The rural setting is wonderfully portrayed and the resolution to the story has heart and scares. I was impressed with the acting all around from Lukas Haas as Frankie, to Alex Rocco as his father giving a great performance and certainly one not his general type, Len Cariou as a family friend, and Helmond as well. This is at its core a ghost story and one of the better ones I have seen of late. It is family-friendly yet eerily frightening. This is one of those perfect films to watch on a cold, winter evening.",8,"['Fantasy', 'Horror', 'Mystery']","['small town', 'ghost', '1960s', 'year 1962', 'bullying']",1988-04-22,['Frank LaLoggia'],"['Lukas Haas', 'Len Cariou', 'Alex Rocco']",['Frank LaLoggia']
Lady Killer,"A former gangster makes it big in Hollywood, but his old life catches up with him.","Lady Killer (1933)

I love these multi-part stories, where one set of scenes shifts to a whole new set, and then they eventually intertwine. And I also love movies that show the inside of Hollywood, with actual recreations of movie sets and movie shoots.

Lady Killer has both, and James Cagney, too. It&apos;s fast, furious, funny, and shot with a bright, glinting intelligence. Not quite a gangster film, it does have crime and some crooked thugs. And not quite a comedy, it pulls out quite a few laughs, mostly because Cagney is a card. There are two fabulous first ladies (and they naturally must view for our man), Mae Clark and Margaret Lindsay, and a slew of second men who hold up their characters with caricature. 

In all, there is no Warner message here, except maybe the virtue can sometimes prevail. It&apos;s just a lot of great scenes, witty dialog, and a play of good guys against bad guys. Look for some stunning rain scenes in California (yeah, I know), and for a huge range of interior and exterior set ups, fairly elaborate for Warner Bros. budgets. 

For Cagney fans, it&apos;s a riot to see him take on, briefly, a series of roles as Indian chief, Italian lover, and prisoner on work detail. The latter, of course, is close to the real roles that made him famous, and his role here is actually a little lighter than that, a bad guy who is all wisecracks and cheerfulness. Look for some insider jokes, like the poster (and mention) of the Edward G. Robinson film, and the movie ushers wearing hats all with the Warner Brothers logo on it.

Great stuff. I loved it even as I knew it wasn&apos;t quite a masterpiece.

Ladyhawke,"The thief Gaston escapes the dungeon of medieval Aquila through the latrine. Soldiers are about to kill him when Navarre saves him. Navarre, traveling with his spirited hawk, plans to kill the bishop of Aquila with help from Gaston.","Ever since I was a kid, I loved fantasy movies. As a matter of fact, anything with sword fights was great in my book. And since I grew up in the days before Lord of the Rings came along, my favourites were always mid-to-late-eighties fantasy epics like The Princess Bride, Willow, and Ladyhawke.

It&apos;s all about an outcast knight and his lover, who have been cursed by an evil bishop to become animals during night and day, so they&apos;re never together in human form. He becomes a wolf and she becomes a hawk (hence the title). The knight enlists the help of a young thief to break into the cathedral and take his revenge on the bishop. Aside from the basic premise, it&apos;s more of a historical movie than a fantasy movie. There&apos;s no magic other than the curse, and no trolls or giants or anything, which was partly the reason I enjoyed it so much.

I&apos;ve also always loved this movie for it&apos;s great storyline and interesting characters. Philipe&apos;s conversations with God still amuse me, as does the drunken monk played by Leo McKern ... It comes from director Richard Donner, who of course brought us Superman I & II, the Lethal Weapon movies and so on. This is essentially a well-directed movie, although a lot of people have issues with the choice of soundtrack. It&apos;s kind of a techno-poppy thing, which I blame NeverEnding Story for. A lot of eighties fantasy movies went with the same idea, but it works with Ladyhawke better than it works with most others, although I would of course prefer a more conventional and less intrusive score. On the whole, the sets and the props are pretty convincing, although some of the fight sequences aren&apos;t particularly great.

Here we have an early Matthew Broderick performance which shows how little his acting skills have developed since. Not that he&apos;s a bad actor, just an early bloomer I guess. Cult icon Rutger Hauer, of whom I have always been a huge fan (Blade Runner, The Hitcher, The 10th Kingdom) gives a fantastic performance as the outcast knight, and as we all know it&apos;s never a bad idea to have Michelle Pfeiffer in a movie.

You should definitely see this movie if you&apos;re a fan of the genre, or of any of the actors involved.

 It&apos;s an uneven blend of nervous thrills (especially during any underwater scenes) and laughter--played to perfection. Brendan Gleeson&apos;s character manages to draw the most attention and the most laughs as the sheriff who tangles with an eccentric hunter (Oliver Platt). Platt is good but his character tends to be annoying at times.

Betty White plays a variation of her usual stock comedy character and provides an amusing twist for the final scene. Bridget Fonda looks attractive and handles her sharp exchanges with Pullman in a throughly professional manner.

Land des Schweigens und der Dunkelheit,"Through examining Fini Straubinger, an old woman who has been deaf and blind since adolescence, and her work on behalf of other deaf and blind people, this film shows how the deaf and blind struggle to understand and accept a worl...","LAND OF SILENCE AND DARKNESS is an early documentary in the career of German film-maker Werner Herzog, a story laced with sadness and alienation that bears some stylistic similarity to Herzog&apos;s dramatic film THE ENIGMA OF KASPAR HAUSER. This one&apos;s all real though, a documentary that proves to be depressing and uplifting in equal measure.

It&apos;s a documentary that explores the world of deafblind people living in Germany, controlled by a campaigning woman, Fini Straubinger, who makes it her business to travel the country and help those in need. What transpires is a travelogue fraught with unforgettable moments; moments that I don&apos;t mind admitting had me in tears on more than one occasion. The sequence with a 22 year old man who&apos;s never had any education or even contact with the outside world - he can&apos;t even walk - is the film&apos;s moving highlight.

Herzog lets his story speak for himself, although he makes some strong choices as director.

The Last Days on Mars,A group of astronaut explorers succumb one by one to a mysterious and terrifying force while collecting specimens on Mars.,"I remember when this came out having absolutely no interest, though the solid cast appealed nothing else did. Now I&apos;ve seen it I see that I was wrong, mostly.

Starring Liev Schreiber, Elias Koteas and Olivia Williams the film has no issues with it&apos;s cast. The premise being of the horror sci-fi type was not what I expected and I certainly mean that in a good way!

The film was interestingly constructed, had my attention and when the first encounter took place it had me gripped. This was good! This was really good and I couldn&apos;t wait to see where this adventure was going to go.

Sadly shortly after the quality starts to dip, the potential I saw gets thrown in the trash and the incredible movie I foresaw faded away. Gone was the premise, gone was the tension, gone was the interest.

Sure it doesn&apos;t get bad, but it doesn&apos;t retain the same quality and it certainly doesn&apos;t utilize its potential. I was fascinated by this concept so why did they have to drop the ball so badly? There are so few movies that deal with such subject matter so when one comes out and wastes it&apos;s opportunity it&apos;s heartbreaking.

The Last Days on Mars is still a watchable affair but damn it should have been so very much better.

Starts strong

Great cast

The film is a spectacle from the middle thirties, after the De Mille manner, which is to say it tries to look big but is actually, upon closer examination, at best mid-sized. RKO didn&apos;t really have the bucks to make a film on as lavish a scale as they surely would have wished. The film has many flaws, but also virtues. It was made by the King Kong team of Ernest Schoedsak and Merian Cooper, who were very resourceful gentlemen, highly creative and not at all like other Hollywood film-makers, and therefore the movie has a unique style that&apos;s difficult to put into words. The best way I can describe their approach is to say that it&apos;s highly individual; its makers had their own way of doing things, and therefore told their their story, or more properly showed it, so that the movie doesn&apos;t resemble other films with similar themes. Also on the plus side is its cast, not of thousands, maybe of hundreds; more likely of dozens. In the leading role Preston Foster&apos;s anchors the film in a kind of emotional reality. He may not have been the most versatile of actors but he was a most sincere one, and he is excellent in the lead. Also good is Basil Rathbone as Pontius Pilate, surprisingly unhammy. It&apos;s a very good movie overall, hokey as hell but always watchable, and in the end, while the spectacle of Mount Vesuvius erupting isn&apos;t all it might be, the movie as whole at least holds firm, and I for one was moved by it, not to tears maybe, but in a more modest way, by the smaller, more intimate tale of a good man who comes to his senses too late, at least for redemption in this world.",9,"['Adventure', 'Drama']","['bare chested male', 'psychotronic film', '1st century', 'roman empire', 'title co written by female']",1935-10-18,"['Ernest B.

Last Shift,A rookie cop&apos;s 1st shift alone in the last night of a closing police station turns into a living nightmare.,"Was really intrigued by the premise of &apos;Last Shift&apos;. The poster/cover and advertising also looked quite creepy. Was encouraged a little by the average rating and divisive reviews, considering my recent viewings of low-budget films which tended to be poorly received on both counts. So it wasn&apos;t as if &apos;Last Shift&apos; didn&apos;t have anything going for it. It actually did have a sizeable degree of potential. 

&apos;Last Shift&apos; didn&apos;t really live up to much of its potential, turning out to be a film that was nowhere near as good as its premise. It is not unwatchable, it has its good things, and there are certainly far worse films, not just overall but of its genre. It is sadly a case of losing steam far too early after a promising start, with a good first third, and playing it too safe, not enough new ideas or risks and it gets silly and at points dull.

There are good things. Was pleasantly surprised by how good the production values were, the film is very well shot, eerily lit and makes the most of the simple but atmospheric locations. The editing is cohesive at least as well. The sound is not overbearing or obvious, not making the scares too foreseeable.

Juliana Harkovy is a credible lead and as said the first third is good. It is creepy and suspenseful, with not too much of an over-reliance on jump-scares and did find myself biting my nails and jumping a little at times. 

Unfortunately, the rest of the acting is pretty non-descript and the character writing is yet another case of having bland characters and also being frustrating in how they behave, a bugbear of mine is hasty and less than logical decision making and there is a lot of that in &apos;Last Shift&apos;. The script never feels natural or flows and it is very difficult to take it seriously. The direction is uneven, assured in the first third but somewhat leaden towards the end. 

Momentum is lost and some of the film gets tedious. Furthermore, the tension, creepiness and suspense goes and is replaced by a lot of face-palming, predictability, tedium and silliness. The final act is a mess of incoherence and intelligence-insulting dumbness and then culminates with an ending that doesn&apos;t feel like one at all and reeks of the writers not knowing how to end the film and taking the easy way out.

The Last Stand,"The leader of a drug cartel busts out of a courthouse and speeds to the Mexican border, where the only thing in his path is a sheriff and his inexperienced staff.","Let me start by saying this is a straight-up good guys vs. bad guys, shoot &apos;em up action movie. Would you expect anything less from Ahhnold? I&apos;ll say that I was happy to hear Arnold was returning to the big screen for starring roles once his Governorship was over. I&apos;ve been a die hard Arnold fan since I was 6. Sure he&apos;s a senior citizen now...but he&apos;s ARNOLD! The trailers for this movie don&apos;t really hide anything, it&apos;s presented exactly how it is. It&apos;s an action movie that doesn&apos;t take itself too seriously. The movie does try and have these heartfelt moments which come off more as cheesy than anything else. But I will give the movie props for actually trying to develop its characters to the point they&apos;re not just cardboard cut outs. They have personality and emotions so you actually care if they live or die. Which is more than I can say for most movies of this type. Unfortunately the movie seemed to be relying heavily on Arnold&apos;s return to the big screen to put butts in the theatre seats. The movie only made $6 million on its opening weekend. Making it the bottom of the barrel at the box office. However I went and saw it on a Tuesday night at 7pm and the theatre was packed. So perhaps word is travelling that it&apos;s a fun movie and it&apos;ll be able to make some money back.

Last Train from Gun Hill,"A marshal tries to bring the son of an old friend, an autocratic cattle baron, to justice for his role in the rape and murder of the marshal&apos;s Native American wife.","Some say Rio Bravo, some the Searchers, some Shane for some reason. Everyone has an opinion about what the greatest &apos;classic&apos; western (before the &apos;60s when Leone and Peckinpah broke the old myths) is. I would have said High Noon for a while ago. Then I was home last evening, at a very cold and snowy winter day. I thought to look at a movie from TV and didn&apos;t care much what they were showing. It happened to be this masterpiece. And I was awe-struck.

The story tells about a sheriff (Kirk Douglas), whose Indian wife and a mother to his child is raped and murdered. He goes on to find the men who did it to the town of Gun Hill and finds out that the other of the men is the son of his old friend (Anthony Quinn). He has in time become the most powerful man of Gun Hill and won&apos;t let his son to be taken to the court for his actions.

This is a quite daring one for a fifties western. There&apos;s some blood and nudity here. And most of all, the sides aren&apos;t black and white, but rather shades of gray. The movie&apos;s most potent message is that you can&apos;t take a life, even a criminal, because there will be people who were close to him and his death will hurt them worse. Every life is valuable.

Kirk Douglas is good in the lead role. He bottles most of his emotions in, as probably anyone in his situation would. Better is Anthony Quinn, who essentially has to decide between his son and his best friend. He portrays anger, fear, anxiety and hopelessness great.

This became my favorite classic western. it&apos;s not Once Upon a Time in the West, but I loved to see so mature themes in such an old movie. It looks great too, they had wonderful set builders then.

The Last Voyage,"After a boiler explosion aboard an aging ocean liner, a man struggles to free his injured wife from the wreckage of their cabin and ensure the safety of their four-year-old daughter as the ship begins to sink.","
* 3/5 STARS -


A family battles for survival as an explosion devastates their cruise ship and punctures its hull. The father must race to free his wife as rising waters threaten them all.

The Last Voyage is fun to watch because it&apos;s so OLD. This is the first modern motion picture involving a sinking ship OTHER THAN the Titanic. The movie is squeaky-clean, and Robert Stack is as wooden as a two-by-four as the desperate father. There&apos;s not much dramatic tension created here, but that almost seems to be a function of the time period.

This is the final voyage of the U. S. S. Claratin, and her primitive construction becomes critical when a fire in the engine room melts the fuel flow valves in the fully open position. Within minutes, the boiler explodes and creates a very visually satisfying hole blown through every deck of the ship. Of course, this hole separates the family, and when the father struggles to rescue his daughter by trying to cross this bottomless void, we know this movie is going to try hard. And it does.

The special effects are somewhat sparse but exceptionally well done for the period. I was surprised by the level of expensive detail, such as water pouring in through the dining room windows even though they&apos;re only visible for a few moments. Dad&apos;s first challenge is to rescue his daughter from her perch alongside the path of the boiler. Then he must find a way to free his wife, who lays pinned under several steel beams in her stateroom. This becomes his objective for the remainder of the movie.

A friendly fireman (one who stokes the fires in the engine room) helps Stack get the equipment he will need to free his wife. Meanwhile, the sailors below decks attempt to reinforce the walls of the engine room to prevent the bulkhead from breaching. It does, of course, and that&apos;s when everyone really starts to run out of time.

This movie is particularly memorable for its ending sequence, which shows the survivors running down the length of the ship&apos;s upper deck, as water splashes onto the floorboards from the sea. This visual is striking, and even a modern audience will wonder how the shot was done; was this a giant set or did the producers simply sink a ship and film its last few minutes above water?

Disaster enthusiasts should see The Last Voyage because it stands uniquely alone in the timeline of movie history. It was the first modern movie based upon people being trapped in an enclosed construction (such as a boat or a building) that was NOT based on a historical event (such as the sinking of the Titanic). More importantly, the plot of the movie was focused on dealing with the disaster, rather than the disaster coming as a big finish to the main story line. This is the formula that dozens of movies would attempt to perfect for the remainder of the century and beyond.

Although it is rather bland, this film is crisp, efficient, and a key turning point for the genre. It represents Hollywood&apos;s first try at the modern disaster movie: it features a plot focused on multiple characters escaping from a fictional situation, while fighting for survival amid expensive special effects.",,"['Action', 'Adventure', 'Drama']","['piano', 'rescue', 'bare chested male', 'sinking ship', 'shipwreck']",1960-02-19,['Andrew L.

The Last Waltz,A film account and presentation of the final concert of The Band.,"Martin Scorsese&apos;s documentary has been labelled a time capsule of an era, and whilst this type of reference usually sounds overstated, there is no doubting the accomplishment of this film as an event. Many use the documentary &apos;Woodstock: 3 Days of Peace and Music&apos; as the ultimate example of a music-doco, but whilst the music in The Last Waltz is actually on par with the great performances of Woodstock (bar Jimi Hendrix[there&apos;s no substitute]), the thing which elevates The Last Waltz is the photography.

 This was the first music doco to be shot on 35mm and watching the concert, you&apos;d think that each performance was carefully choregraphed over a few weeks of shooting rather than over one night. Special thanks must be given to Cinematogrpaher Michael Chapman for his efforts on this film. The look of the film is what elevates it&apos;s overall appeal, because the music was always going to be epic, especially with the cavalcade of great names performing. This is just great filmmaking from contemporary cinema&apos;s most accomplished filmmaker. And how about that haunting theme that both starts and ends the film.

The Lavender Hill Mob,A meek bank clerk who oversees the shipment of bullion joins with an eccentric neighbor to steal gold bars and smuggle them out of the country as miniature Eiffel Towers.,"Alec Guinness is the reason for that emoji with eyes replaced with hearts, right? I mean, seriously, I first met Alec Guinness while watching The Bridge on the River Kwai, and his turn as the seriously extreme Colonel Nicholson is one that will stay with the viewer long after the film ends. Guinness reintroduced himself to me in Lawrence of Arabia, another extreme role proving the man behind the roles that had blown me away was someone to see more of. I&apos;m currently on a quest to see as many Guinness films as I can which led me to his turn in the 1951 film directed by Charles Crichton, The Lavender Hill Mob. In the Lavender Hill Mob, Guinness plays an unassuming bank clerk who decides to put a plan in motion to bring his life something more. In a classic British comedy, which exposed a whole new side of Alec Guinness, The Lavender Hill Mob is a film to see. 

Holland (Alec Guinness) is a feeble, regimented, shy bank clerk, who is constantly reminded that he is not getting any younger. After 20 years, he has worked for the same bank as their agent who oversees the deliveries of gold bullion. After a chance meeting with a Mr. Pendlebury (Stanley Holloway), a maker of souvenirs, Holland realizes (in a very Leo Bloom a la The Producers way) that with Mr. Pendlebury&apos;s tools and expertise, the pair could steal gold from the bank and melt it into miniature Eiffel Tower souvenirs, smuggling massive amounts of money for themselves. After becoming committed to their ideas, the unlikely pair put a plan in motion with the help of a couple of career criminals, Lackery (Sidney James) and Shorty (Alfie Bass). Of course, the plan doesn&apos;t go as smoothly as it was first conceived, and it becomes a comedy of errors for the plan to succeed, a true treat for audiences. 

British films are so fun, the comedic dialogue so unique to films that come from across the pond, is second to none. The writing in The Lavender Hill Mob is sensational, filled with jokes or subtle lines, it is a film that has something new to give upon each viewing. The comedic timing is also a standout in The Lavender Hill Mob. Each actor plays a great role and proves their talents for comedic acting with fantastic performances in The Lavender Hill Mob. Another surprising standout in this film was the score. People don&apos;t expect much in the way of a musical score in a comedy, The Lavender Hill Mob blows that stigma out of the water. The score, the comedic acting, the performances make The Lavender Hill Mob a film to be sure to watch, especially if you&apos;re tired of the mindless comedies that are so plentiful in American cinemas. The show stopper is Alec Guinness, I am not sure this wonderful film would be as wonderful without him. The Lavender Hill Mob certainly won&apos;t be the last Alec Guinness film that I see.",8,"['Comedy', 'Crime']","['france', 'paris france', 'scotland yard', 'eiffel tower paris', 'gold']",1951-09-10,['Charles Crichton'],"['Alec Guinness', 'Stanley Holloway', 'Sidney James']",['T.E.B.

Lawrence of Arabia,"The story of T.E. Lawrence, the English officer who successfully united and led the diverse, often warring, Arab tribes during World War I in order to fight the Turks.","A man has an inner drive that makes him peculiar and intense. He goes to the desert and falls in love with it and its people. Gaining powerful sponsors, he has a grand vision that he accomplishes by inspiring and directing thousands. But in a very short time, that grand work is compromised and disassembled by fat cats in offices who are concerned with different values.

True of both Lawrence and Lean. The legacy of Lawrence is still in violent disarray (I write this a short time after the Sept 11 attacks on New York). But Lean&apos;s vision was saved, and what a vision! Of this picture, it can be said that it is perfect if only because it is so visionary that it defines its own rules.

Lean&apos;s vision is also lean, with vast zones of sonic and visual silence -- several meditations on the unperceived. Though there is a story (who are you?) this is really a film of TE&apos;s &apos;Seven Pillars,&apos; which creates a romantic vision of sculpted natural forces. So powerful a depiction that Islam experienced a faddish attraction in the West, a place now enjoyed by Tibetan Buddhism. That was before.

See here the original Obiwan, every intonation, movement and dress. See here Peter O&apos;Toole&apos;s personality become completely entwined with the character, who is as fictionalized by our eye as by Lowell&apos;s. See the most expressive, anthropomorphic train wreck in history.

Watch a particularly interesting brand of acting by the &apos;Arabs.&apos; Macho men are acting anyway, so an actor can play an actor when he lands such a role.

The star of the film is the clever eye of God, not the clockmaker or judge of the west but the chess player of the mirage. Its face is clearest in my mind when the Turk holds TE down for torture and smiles. Its hand in the creaking of Feisal&apos;s tent -- who would ever imagine the wind acting?

There isn&apos;t any stereotyping in this movie, they have blacks and whites of different classes and backgrounds. Ever black isn&apos;t shiftless and and all of the whites aren&apos;t racist. I think it is a fair depiction of what blacks went through and the frustration they felt at that time. Its not the greatest movie I have seen, but it think it&apos;s worth watching.",7,['Drama'],"['national film registry', 'christmas', 'teenager', 'kansas', '1920s']",1970-03-13,['Gordon Parks'],"['Kyle Johnson', 'Alex Clarke', 'Estelle Evans']","['Gordon Parks', 'Genevieve Young']"
Leatherface: Texas Chainsaw Massacre III,A California couple and a survivalist encounter Leatherface and his family.,"This second sequel to the horror classic is something of a letdown, purely because of the storyline. While the first sequel, dominated by Dennis Hopper&apos;s crazed performance, explored the key figures in a novel way, LEATHERFACE is a film that&apos;s content to simply emulate the first movie&apos;s storyline. Once again we get unwary travellers falling foul of Leatherface and his family, and an extended climax involving a family dinner. It&apos;s all way too familiar, and of course lacks the sheer intensity of Tobe Hooper&apos;s original classic.

The film&apos;s tone is wildly uneven throughout, and even in the would-be horror scenes it&apos;s hard to take it seriously. The movie feels like a spoof; it has a light-hearted tone that sits at odds with the grimness of the plot. Still, on the plus side, it&apos;s very fast paced, and it features a great deal of crowd-pleasing horror elements that are sure to win the hearts of splatter fans, although as with the original, it&apos;s never quite as gory as you think it&apos;s going to be (and I&apos;m talking about the uncut version).

One of those crowd-pleasers is Ken Foree, Mr. DAWN OF THE DEAD himself, playing one of the film&apos;s would-be victims. Foree is a delight, and they sure play up to his potential, portraying him as a real ass-kicker of a man. I couldn&apos;t care less about the two characters who are supposed to be the leads, but Foree hooks you right from the start. The rest of the actors are less than impressive, and in particular the guy who plays Leatherface is just a stock heavy; there&apos;s certainly none of the hulking, imposing brutality that Gunnar Hansen brought to the role.

Of course, one of the draws watching this film today is seeing a pre-stardom Viggo Mortensen playing in a decidedly odd type of role, completely different from what you might expect; I enjoyed his performance, even if much of it is played for laughs. And that&apos;s the trouble with the film as a whole: we&apos;re back to that spoofy tone, that whole non-serious feel that everyone&apos;s laughing at the premise rather than getting to grips with the horrifying implications of it. Take the ear scene, for example, or the string of increasingly ridiculous and unbelievable things that happen at the climax (including the fate of one of the characters, which makes no sense whatsoever; blame a substituted ending for that one, after the original didn&apos;t go down too well with test audiences). In fact, come the end, I enjoyed this more as a bizarre comedy than as a genuine horror outing.",6,"['Horror', 'Thriller']","['gas station', 'shotgun', 'survivalist', 'leatherface', 'gas station attendant']",1990-01-12,['Jeff Burr'],"['Kate Hodge', 'Ken Foree', 'R.A.

Yang, the last of a long line of Song generals, is killed and his widowed wife Mu leads other widows into battle to save thei...","If there&apos;s a question I can ask director Frankie Chan, it will be whether he&apos;s genuinely proud of this effort. He&apos;s a veteran, and there&apos;s no denying that he&apos;s done a handful of entertaining films I&apos;ve grown up with. There&apos;s no lack of funding in making this film, from the numerous costumes, weaponry, and sheer logistics in staging large scaled battles, coupled with special effects that looked really slipshod, but this one really took the cake in the disrespect shown toward production values on the whole, and with that insulted the technical craftsmanship of those who work hard in the industry, having their craft sullied by quick hacks who couldn&apos;t care less about quality so long as they get a semblance of something done. It&apos;s as if the producers had paid Cecilia Cheung millions from their budget, then realized their folly as they ran out of funds to ensure quality in their delivery such that corners had to be cut, and cut in the most disgraceful manner.

Battle scenes were so obviously switched from outdoor shoots to interior sound stages with badly done green screen effects, and the action choreography itself was lacking in ideas that it started to be unintentionally funny, from obvious speeding up of frames to compensate for the actresses lack of martial arts background, to horses definitely on a slow trot rather than being ridden at top speed to escape pursuing enemies. I could have sworn the cast were just going through the motion during production, with little care being taken to ensure some form of proper stance adopted to make them credible warriors. Believability is something never considered at all by anyone in the film, and the wire work utilized here is nothing short of embarrassing the craftsman who had perfected the art of executing such moves seamlessly and without much fanfare. At best, it looked like Chinese Opera (no offense intended), with many twirls and gentle combat passing off as intense life or death battles Boasting a cast of veterans such as Ritchie Jen, Kathy Chow, Cheng Peipei and Cecilia Cheung herself amongst other relative unknowns to make up the numbers of 10 or more of the widowers from the Yang family who had to step up and be counted when the sole male bloodline is called upon to lead grossly outnumbered troops against the enemy. We learn who they all are, right down to their maiden names and weapons of choice, but frankly you would only remember the many poor wirework and effects trying to pass the characters off as formidable warriors. What you would get is the sorry feeling for any self-respecting performer having to put up with sub-standard support that calls for the actresses to be at their best to avoid laughing at themselves, keeping a straight face to deliver cringeworthy lines and juvenile action pieces.

Which is a pity, because there was so much potential hidden in the film that went unrealized, if only they had paid a lot more attention to what story they want to tell rather than to take on every caricature, and added depth to the romantic story contained within, which came complete with some lesbian undertones as well. But I digress. In summary it&apos;s summer blockbuster material with a very simple plot of good versus evil, with the former being outnumbered and hampered from victory no thanks to corrupt officials, and the reliance of their strategies and wits to defeat both the enemy from within and the larger invasion forces. If done right that is. Big action pieces were assembled haphazardly, with the ones that took the cake involving Raiders of the Lost Ark type giant rolling balls on fire, and the constructing of human bridges so ridiculous it has to be seen to be believed. Characters came and went according to their conveniences when doing battle, that the initial strategy of flanking and outflanking the enemy, and the employment of military deceit, turned out to be nothing but one complete, incoherent mess.

The filmmakers could have just gotten away with it if not for the very amateurish martial arts on display, since in my opinion good kungfu trounces the need of a proper plot, though not always. What&apos;s legendary in this film, was clearly the blatant slip shoddiness of its filmmaking, grossly insulting all paying audiences by conning their hard earned dollar to deliver something even if made in the 1970s, will be frowned upon for its lack of artistic merit and integrity. The subtitle in Mandarin refers to how military orders are like mountains, unmovable and expected to be followed to the letter, and would have served as a pretty awesome crux to the entire movie, but in reality these scenes became jokes, and the only unmovable experience was the innate need to see just how bad this film will go and stoop to.

Films such as Legendary Amazons can be made with Mainland funding, but please either have a little quality control or stop meddling with a veteran filmmaker&apos;s vision (I have an inkling Frankie Chan could have suffered interference from those who hold the purse strings), and restrict its distribution to a home market that is perhaps a lot more forgiving than markets abroad, where competition in quality is keener, and any average films put side by side will make them look like masterpieces. Avoid at all cost, unless you have plenty of time to burn, in which I would recommend you&apos;d get more kick out of watching paint dry.

Legong: Dance of the Virgins,"In Bali, a young woman falls in love with a musician, but he may have eyes for her half-sister.","I found this to be a very interesting film. It is shot in the film equivalent of a duo-tone, 2 strip Technicolor (more specifically process 3). This basically comprises red and green filters used on initial exposure of the film. Followed by a process which creates red and green dyed frames on a single reel. On playback the red and green frames combine on the screen to create various shades and hues. One of the major drawbacks of Technicolor 2 strip is that you shouldn&apos;t compose shots which contain blue sky, as it will reproduce green! Technical aspects aside, I first saw the film at Castro theater in San Francisco with Gemelan Sekar Jaya performing a score. While this may not be the original way the film was shown it surely enhanced my experience. Gamelan are Balinese metalophone orchestras which perform on instruments with non-western tuning. The color tones add a vaguely otherworldly hue to the proceedings. At several plot turns audience members actually let out audible gasps or shrieks. Such was the enthralling effect of the film. Yes there is an element of cultural colonialism, but not nearly so bad as contemporary films I have seen in other non-western locales. The principals are Balinese, not westerners made-up to look native. The depiction is sympathetic almost anthropological not sensationalistic. It is also remarkable in that it is one of the last of the silent films. 1935 being well after the inception of talkies. The story is somewhat simplistic. I do not know if this is a conceit of the directors style as I have not seen any of his other works. However it did not impede my enjoyment.",9,"['Drama', 'Romance']","['ethnofiction', 'docufiction', 'two color technicolor', 'unrequited love', 'letter']",1935-11-15,['Henri de la Falaise'],"['Poetoe Aloes Goesti', 'Bagus Mara Goesti', 'Saplak Njoman']","['Gaston Glass', 'Henri de la Falaise']"

Lenny,"The story of acerbic 1960s comic Lenny Bruce, whose groundbreaking, no-holds-barred style and social commentary was often deemed by the Establishment as too obscene for the public.","To be honest I don&apos;t think the rest of the film quite deserves 8 stars, but Dustin Hoffman&apos;s performance as Lenny Bruce is so extraordinary that it lifts the movie up to that rating.

Made in a fairly familiar quasi-documentary style, &apos;Lenny&apos; begins with &apos;present day&apos; (i.e. 1974) interviews with the surviving characters from Lenny&apos;s life, cut with flashbacks to his 1950&apos;s beginnings as a &apos;traditional&apos; comic, and &apos;late&apos; live performances in his post-drug-bust days. As the film progresses and the narrative catches up with the interviews, the gaps between these segments &apos;close&apos;. Clever use is made of some of Lenny&apos;s material, cutting from keywords or phrases in his bits, to events in his life with inspired or correlated to them.

All the same there is something a little dry and disappointing in the film&apos;s structure: almost as if it could have used a more conventional, linear narrative, like Milos Forman&apos;s tribute to Andy Kauffman, &apos;Man on the Moon&apos; would use to such great effect 25 years later.

Ironically though, such a structure might have deprived of us of seeing more of Hoffman doing Lenny&apos;s bits &apos;live&apos; on stage - and for me these were the highlights, which I wish had lasted longer, rather than flashing back to some past event after 30 seconds. As a big Lenny Bruce fan, I can only say that Hoffman&apos;s portrayal is almost supernatural. It&apos;s like he&apos;s channeling the guy. He has his mannerisms and improvisational style down perfectly. You would swear you were seeing these improvisations for the first time if you hadn&apos;t heard them already. In fact, Hoffman possibly even improves on Lenny&apos;s delivery in one small respect. Lenny had a penchant for the &apos;conversation&apos; that would erupt in the middle of one of his bits, between two or more characters. Hoffman probably puts a bit more distinction between the characters than Lenny often did (quite often they would all just sound like Lenny, which was part of the magic, but never mind.) Over 30 years on, it&apos;s quite amazing to me that this film has become a relative obscurity in Dustin Hoffman&apos;s filmography. Frankly, though Hoffman has blown me away on various occasions, I don&apos;t ever remember being more blown away than this. And if you were to pick easy people to imitate, I doubt Lenny Bruce on stage would be high on many people&apos;s lists.

The film as a whole is good, but to witness Hoffman channeling Bruce, it&apos;s a must-see.",8,"['Biography', 'Drama']","['stand up comedian', 'jewish', 'adult humor', 'self destructiveness', 'drug addiction']",1975-02-07,['Bob Fosse'],"['Dustin Hoffman', 'Valerie Perrine', 'Jan Miner']",['Julian Barry']

Låt den rätte komma in,,"Let the Right One In is a most unique film about early adolescent puppy love between a sweet and oft bullied boy and his new neighbor, a 100-plus year old vampire that has occupied a 12 year old girl&apos;s body. They are kindred spirits, both lonely, misunderstood and seemingly adrift, searching for meaning and, in their own ways - blood. I really liked the pacing of the film - some that are used to bang-bang-shoot-em-up flicks might say plodding, but for the patient film-goer I say - just right. The boy, living in a single parent family with his mom and with periodic contact with this dad, is the target of a cruel group of classmates led by one particularly vile and sadistic punk, whose even more brutal older brother gradually emerges from the shadows as the drama unfolds. The girl lives in squalor with an old guy who she probably has more years on despite the contrast between his aging body and her youthful shell. He is charged with getting fresh blood for her. But, he is a clod and blunderer (there is a sort of slapstick to his shtick) and he cannot consistently deliver, leaving her to seek her own sustenance in very dramatic fashion. As the two protagonists become great pals and a little more, their secrets are revealed to one another and the story builds to most imaginative and satisfying conclusion. I won&apos;t give it away by saying more. If you are adventurous, see this movie that you won&apos;t soon forget...PS.

Lethal Weapon,Two newly paired cops who are complete opposites must put aside their differences in order to catch a gang of drug smugglers.,"I have watched Lethal Weapon dozens of times and it still entertains me like it originally did in 1987.

A good cop movie has to have the following ingredients; chemistry between it&apos;s stars, plenty of action, plenty of humour, action, car chases and a damn good villain.

American cops seemed to be stereotyped in movies. They always seem to be crazy and without any respect for their superiors. I hope they&apos;re not like that in real life but it&apos;s perfect for a movie.

It&apos;s great seeing Riggs and Murtaugh become good buddies by the end of the movie. I like cop films like that. 

The really great thing about Lethal Weapon is the action. Riggs is crazy in this film-I wouldn&apos;t want to meet a cop like him. Riggs and Murtaugh are opposites but they say opposites attract. Riggs is mad and Murtaugh is sane. Together they spell bad news for the bad guys.

I would also like to give credit to Gary Busey who never disappoints when it comes to playing a villain (or indeed any other part).

Licence to Kill,A vengeful James Bond goes rogue to infiltrate and take down the organization of a drug lord who has murdered his friend&apos;s new wife and left him near death.,"The worst-performing movie in the Bond movie in terms of grosses, it probably failed because it wasn&apos;t really a Bond at all. True, it is the character Fleming created, and Q is in there, but this extremely violent thriller with its strong female characterisation (Carey Lowell, perhaps the only Bond girl with `balls&apos;) is not a neat fit with the others.

The only one of the franchise created especially with star Timothy Dalton in mind (perhaps the sexiest Bond of them all?) it is a tale of loyalty, drug cartels, sharks, and 007 losing his licence and setting off as a vigilante. Lowell plays agent Pam Bouvier, who shines in a bar fight and gives 007 as good as he gets. And boy, do these two have chemistry together!

The only problem with this movie is that it gets so truncated on its TV showings that it loses a lot of its point (and in the worst edit I saw, its sense). There is perhaps too much going on - the abused Latino bimbo, the crooked evangelist, the Japanese businessmen touring the factory, the casino 

Not at all as bad as many commentators at the time and since have suggested. What a pity the series stagnated after this before its big budget Pierce Bronson revival. Dalton should have had the chance to show us more of the character he portrays in `Licence to Kill&apos;.

The Lickerish Quartet,"Filmed in the breathtaking Castle of Balsorano in Italy&apos;s Abruzzi Mountains, The Lickerish Quartet finds three people obsessed with an erotic film that features a striking young blonde woman.","It&apos;s hard for me to rate this movie because I have no reference to what porn or sexploitation film was like in the late 60s. This is definitely not one of those seedy production, but actually a decent dramatic movie.

I understand that the director was born in New York, but the movie has European flavor to it. The world was going through the sexual revolution, and many experimental films were created during this period. What I see in this movie is what the French used to call Nouvelle Vague (New Wave) where the reason for the story takes back seat to the unintelligible vagueness that&apos;s supposed to enhance the artistry of the production.

Nouvelle Vague didn&apos;t last too long as it didn&apos;t gather much following, but there were more than few of this type of movies made by Jean-Luc Godard and Roger Vadim. In fact, the film strongly reminds me of Roger Vadim&apos;s style of film making.

I have to give credit to the beauty of this film. The director certainly has eyes for keeping interesting and clean appearance to the picture.

How you rate the story of the movie probably differs widely depending on the audience. I kind of liked it for its modern appearance, and interesting story.

Life of Pi,"A young man who survives a disaster at sea is hurtled into an epic journey of adventure and discovery. While cast away, he forms an unexpected connection with another survivor: a fearsome Bengal tiger.","Ang lee&apos;s life of pi is an adaptation of a &apos;Man booker prize winner&apos; novel by the same name, written by Yann Martel. It&apos;s a story set in the late seventies of an Indian teenager (Pi Patel) who is stranded on a life boat in the pacific. What distinguishes this tale of survival from the rest is that the author dishes out a delicious slice of creativity in giving the castaway, a tiger for a companion. Yes, like the posters and trailers have you believe, there is a boat on which a man and a tiger have to live! This makes &apos;life of pi&apos; not only a story of human struggle against nature but also a profound tale that questions &apos;what separates man from beast?&apos;. More interestingly, &apos;when does man become a beast&apos;? 

But worry not, Ang Lee&apos;s movie does not force you think on these lines , instead it&apos;s a film that lets you enjoy it on so many levels. If you are just looking for a beautiful 3D movie to feast your eyes , Life of pi can be it. If you are in a mood for a thrilling adventure epic on weekend, this is the right ticket. If indeed, you want to experience something thoughtful, Life of pi never forces you on a particular thought, instead it whispers ever so slightly to think about matters of human disposition and finding comfort in convention while caressing your senses with fabulous visuals and background score. 

Suraj Sharma debuts as pi with utter sincerity while Irfan Khan(as adult pi) and Tabu(as mother) do justice to their parts. The rest of the supporting cast blend in perfectly too. Ang lee helms the film with difficult source material with absolute grace and expertise. However there are two true heroes that make Life of Pi work. Firstly the studio and creative director behind the magnificent CGI. The Bengal tiger is perhaps the best animated animal ever created! The angry green eyes, richly textured orange –white striped skin and every hair on its fur look rich and full of life in 3D.And then when your hear the thunderous roar for the first time, you will realize this is as real as it can get! The rest of the animals (a Zebra, an orangutan) look great too. The lovely blue ocean and its resident creatures are the jewel in the crown. The other hero is the writer David Magee(screenplay) who adapts the novel with near perfection. One gripe the fans of the novel might have is the lack of all the gore descriptions and a particular chapter that deals with the surviving &apos;French cook&apos;. The addition of these might have pleased the audience who sought for the philosophical undertones from the story but the film would have lost out on the large PG-13 crowd (a fair deal considering the enormous budget). 

Life of Pi, is a rare masterpiece that stands as a prototype not only for a perfect book adaptation and a 3D movie( sorry avatar, you have just been replaced), but also for a movie based on intricacies of human nature .

Lifeboat,Several survivors of a torpedoed merchant ship in World War II find themselves in the same lifeboat with one of the crew members of the U-boat that sank their ship.,"In one of Alfred Hitchcock&apos;s earliest films, six people with different personalities and backgrounds are stranded together in a lifeboat after the passenger-carrying freighter they are on is sunk by a German u-boat in the Mid-Atlantic.

Lifeforce,"A race of space vampires arrives in London and infects the populace, beginning an apocalyptic descent into chaos.","I first saw Lifeforce back in 1985. I thought it was a decent sci-fi/horror concept of alien vampires. I agree with many of the other reviewers who said the ideas or concept of the film was good. Other than that it was entertaining, not great, but entertaining. There are really two good reasons to see this movie. And they are Mathilda May&apos;s boobs. Hell, her whole naked body for that matter. Man is she hot. She has to be the best looking vampire/alien that has ever graced the screen. Like another reviewer said, she plays evil, seductive, vulnerable and serious very well and all while being naked. To say the least it couldn&apos;t have been easy for her to play the role naked throughout the whole film. Needless to say,I&apos;m glad she did. I agree Railsback was miscast in this.

The Light at the Edge of the World,"A ruthless pirate captures the keeper of a lighthouse, in the most southern city in Argentina. His goal is obvious and horrific.

I first saw it when it was aired by the Beeb in the summer of 1995 and was most impressed. Off the bleak location of Cape Horn around 1865, three lighthouse keepers: a jaded ex-miner Will Denton (Kirk Douglas), Captain Moritz (Fernando Rey) and young Felipe (Massimo Ranieri) are confronted by wreckers led by pirate captain, Jonathan Kongre (Yul Brynner). After his companions are brutally murdered, later including Felipe&apos;s cute macaque monkey, Mario, Denton ekes out a passive existence in a cave till he resolves to fight back assisted by Montefiore (Renato Salvatore) a survivor from one of the ships lured to the rocks by the pirates. The desperate situation is complicated by another survivor, a young English woman, Arabella (Samantha Egger), who is used by Kongre to mimic Denton&apos;s former love, Emily Jane. Douglas and Brynner act with flair - Douglas gives another heroic sub-Nietzschean performance vis a vis 20.000 Leagues under the Sea (1954) and Ulisse (1954). In appearance he looks like a Nineteenth-Century hippie adventurer - bearded and with straight lightbrown hair and fiery blue-green eyes. Brynner is a flamboyant counterpoint. Despite some squeamish scenes and illogical phases the extraordinary Spanish settings - the white-topped rising arches and surreal psychedelic colours plus a soaring romantic light popular classical Italian score by Piero Piccioni give this film a metaphysical feel.",8,"['Adventure', 'Drama', 'Fantasy']","['1800s', 'wrecker', 'lighthouse', 'pirate', 'island']",1971-10-29,['Kevin Billington'],"['Kirk Douglas', 'Yul Brynner', 'Samantha Eggar']","['Tom Rowe', 'Jules Verne', 'Rachel Billington']"
Lightning Over Water,Wim Wenders abandons the shoot of one of his own films in order to help his friend and fellow director Nicholas Ray create his swan song before he dies.,"Lightning Over Water began as a collaborative idea to tell the story of a dying painter who steals art from museums and replaces them with his own forgeries. Suffering from terminal cancer himself, Ray&apos;s health quickly deteriorates during the project. The film eventually ceases to be a work of fiction and becomes a documentary of Ray&apos;s finals days in which he fittingly spends making film. In reflecting over his career and life, Ray ponders his successes and failures as a film maker who is best known for Rebel Without a Cause (1955). A poignant and often disturbing film, Lighting Over Water is ultimately a painful homage to a film maker and to a friend (Klaus Ming March 2013).",7,['Documentary'],"['reference to king lear', 'new german cinema', 'video footage', 'terminal illness', 'filmmaking']",1984-11-23,"['Nicholas Ray', 'Wim Wenders']","['Gerry Bamman', 'Ronee Blakley', 'Pierre Cottrell']","['Nicholas Ray', 'Wim Wenders']"
Lights Out,"Rebecca must unlock the terror behind her little brother&apos;s experiences that once tested her sanity, bringing her face to face with a supernatural spirit attached to their mother.","Lights Out wasn&apos;t a bad film, and it&apos;s always nice when a horror film comes out that has some scary moments and is only PG-13. Usually I go into PG-13 horror films with low expectations, which allowed me to enjoy the movie for what it is: a bunch of jump scares. The short film this movie was based off was simple, and effectively scary. By adding so much to the concept, it threw off the pacing. This film tried to be more than what is was. It tried to explore a deeper meaning, touching on mental illness and family problems (think The Babadook but not nearly as good), but it only managed to scratch the surface in a pretty shallow and uninteresting way. This was only accentuated by sub-par acting from quite a bit of the cast.

However, the film succeeded in making Diana frightening. By not ever showing her real form for much time outside of the shadows, she managed to be pretty horrifying. Definitely a creature to inspire nightmares when you turn out the lights.

Overall it was fun to go see in a theater filled with jumpy teenagers, but not really worth a second watch.",6,"['Horror', 'Mystery']","['switching lights on and off', 'mother daughter estrangement', 'woman in jeopardy', 'bedroom', 'young woman']",2016-07-22,['David F.

Lincoln,"As the American Civil War continues to rage, America&apos;s president struggles with continuing carnage on the battlefield as he fights with many inside his own cabinet on the decision to emancipate the slaves.","I approached this film with caution and did so for several reasons. First and foremost, this is Oscars season and this type of film is just what one expects to come out and be showered with Oscar buzz – and quite often these films are found to be lacking once they are out of this period and on their own. The second reason was related and it was that I didn&apos;t for a second think that this film would be able to go for more than two minutes without the heroic music coming up, a soft focus being slapped on the lens and someone giving a great speech about the morality of everything while the camera cuts to those around looking teary eyed and yet full of admiration. In other words I worried that this would simply be a more expensive version of The West Wing season 1.

Although the film does rather fall into these traps occasionally, it is by no means seriously flawed since the majority of the film is patience and very well delivered. We focus on the final few years of Lincoln&apos;s life, specifically the period towards the end of the war where slavery was abolished by Constitutional amendment. As such the film is about political wrangling and the determination to stay the course with the goal even though it would be difficult and smart politics suggested to not risk the bigger prize (peace) at the expense of an aspiration. The film shows this very well and it manages to be patient without being slow – which is quite the achievement considering that the film is essentially men in rooms talking. The politicking was well delivered so that it wasn&apos;t dull but wasn&apos;t falsely sped up. The sentimentality is kept to a surprisingly low. It is still there of course and the camera frequently looks for a heroic frame and the music often reminds us the grandeur of what we are seeing, but it doesn&apos;t overdo it too much and certainly nowhere near the levels I feared.

Day Lewis is perhaps a given for the Oscar. His Lincoln is certainly a spot on creation – he comes over as heroic and steadfast without being mythicalised by his own performance. He really gives an impression of the man&apos;s spirit throughout the film. The supporting cast is so deep in names and faces that it is hard to know where to start; being honest, at times I did find it a little distracting as a parade came across the screen – seemingly all from TV shows I watch or films I had seen, I suspect I could be quite far down the cast list before I found someone I couldn&apos;t place. Aside from this distracting a little, it does mean the cast is deep in talent and everyone does well. Tommy Lee Jones in particular adds passion and color to all his scenes and the film benefits from his performance. Field is perhaps not as good – although in fairness I didn&apos;t think the personal side to the story worked as well as the rest – and since this is her parts, maybe that is why I didn&apos;t like her performance as much. Spielberg&apos;s direction is very well paced; shots are very well picked and the camera is very patient in its movement.

Lincoln didn&apos;t blow me away but it did quietly impress me. Part of the reason for this is that the film doesn&apos;t go all out for emotion or history or sentimentality, it simply lets it happen in the main and manages to keep these traps to a comparative minimum that really helps the film. It is long but never boring, respectful but never overly so.",,"['Biography', 'Drama', 'History']","['based on real person', 'american politics', '1860s', 'american civil war', 'politics']",2012-11-16,['Steven Spielberg'],"['Daniel Day-Lewis', 'Sally Field', 'David Strathairn']","['Tony Kushner', 'Doris Kearns Goodwin']"

Lèvres de sang,"Frederick sees a photograph of a ruined seaside castle, which triggers a strange childhood memory. He then goes on a strange quest to find the castle and the beautiful woman who lives there.","The movies of Jean Rollin are an acquired taste. He specializes in haunting, sensual, visually impressive movies that frequently concern memory, or memory loss, and obsessively feature beautiful naked women, usually vampires. Maybe Rollin&apos;s therapist can fully explain why his movies deal with this subject matter over and over, but hey, I don&apos;t care, it sure works for me! If you haven&apos;t seen any of his work, &apos;Lips Of Blood&apos; is as good a place to start as any, but frankly I&apos;ve never seen a bad movie by him yet. They&apos;re all good. I&apos;m hooked!

Jean-Lou Philippe stars (and co-scripts) as a thirty something man who becomes obsessed with a photograph which reminds him of of his almost-forgotten childhood, which is sketchy at best. He attempts to track down the location in the picture, and this brings back memories of a beautiful and mysterious girl (the lovely Annie Belle/Briand, who also worked with Deodato and D&apos;Amato) he once met. He finds himself uncovering a family secret and his life goes in a direction he could never have anticipated.

&apos;Lips Of Blood&apos; is yet another wonderfully evocative, dream-like film from Jean Rollin. A truly unique film maker who creates fascinating worlds that are both seductive and dangerous.

The List of Adrian Messenger,A former intelligence officer is tasked by the heir to the Gleneyre estate to investigate the unusual deaths of a disparate group of eleven men on a list.,"(There are Spoilers) Visiting his good friend novelist Adrian Messanger, John Merivale, former WWII British intelligence officer and member of the secretive MI5 agency Anthony Gerthryn, George C. Scott, is puzzled by Messengers&apos; somewhat cryptic sheet of paper that he gave him to investigate. The paper has ten names on it all seemingly having nothing to do with each other.

It&apos;s not long afterword that when Messenger goes on a business flight to Canada that things begin to get a bit clearer for Gerthryn when the plane that Messenger is on suddenly explodes, from a time bomb that was secretly placed on it, in mid-air over the Atlantic Ocean. It just happened that Messenger survived the airplane crash by shearing a raft with another passenger of the doomed flight WWII ace French intelligence man Raoul La Borg, Jacques Roux. La Borg who took down, in his photographic mind, the dying mans last words that reveal, if deciphered, the truth about his list and the person who&apos;s not only responsible for his impending death but the deaths of all the persons, some who at the time were still alive, on it!

Despite its novelty of guessing just who are the actors, Burt Lancaster Frank Sinatra and Tony Curtis etc. etc., playing in the movie with them having very obvious disguises. It&apos;s only Kirk Douglas as George Brougham, together with some half dozen other disguises, and Robert Mitchum as James Slattery who had any real role in the movies plot line. Instead of just showing up in the end and, when the film was finally over, taking off their disguise revealing to the startled viewers just who they were playing.

Gethryn and Borg who both worked together in WWII against the Nazis team up to get to the bottom of what the late Adrian Messenger meant in his list of names and as the two check out the names one at a time.It turns out that all of them, with he exception of James Slattery, died mysteriously over the last five years. Trying to get to Slattery before the killer did the nutty and paranoid rummy gave the two the run around. Claiming that he&apos;s James brother Joe, who doesn&apos;t exist not who he really is James. Which in the end, with Gethryn & Borg giving up on him, lead to his death when the killer pushed him, wheelchair and all, off the docks and into the bay where he drowned.

The killer***SPOILERS***finally reveals himself at a fox-hunt at the estate of the Marquis of Gleneyre, Clive Brook, as his long dead brothers son George Brougham. And gaining his confidence and being excepted by the Marquis as a member of the family he then manically plans to do him in on the next fox-hunt. Where Brougham sets a trap for the old man, who&apos;s expected to be riding on the lead, at the end of hunt. 

It now becomes crystal clear that the reason that the murderous George Brougham had murdered all the people on Messengers&apos; list, as well as Messenger himself. In that they all knew about Bougham&apos;s treachery toward his fellow POW&apos;s whom they all happened to be. The one thing that all the men on Messengers&apos; list had in common in being POW&apos;s in a brutal Japanese prison camp in Burma during WWII. With having them gotten out of the way Bougham is now trying to murder the Maquis of Gleneyer and make it look like an accident so he, as his nephew, can inherited his estate and all the riches and royalties that goes along with it. But there&apos;s one or two things that he never figured on and thats Gethryn & Borg and that in the end would be his undoing.",7,"['Mystery', 'Thriller']","['fox hunt', 'disguise', 'misleading star billing', 'british', 'accident']",1963-05-29,['John Huston'],"['Kirk Douglas', 'Robert Mitchum', 'Tony Curtis']","['Anthony Veiller', 'Philip MacDonald', 'Alec Coppel']"
Little Caesar,A small-time criminal moves to a big city to seek bigger fortune.,"Rico Bandello, a petty crook nicknamed LITTLE CAESAR, plots his rise to become crime boss of the Big City.

Edward G. Robinson made a tremendous impact in this star-making saga of a thoroughly detestable little man who bandies his way through society&apos;s underbelly for a short time until fate brings him his just reward. The evil spawn of a deplorable age, Rico cares for neither booze nor dames, only pure raw power. Even loyalty & friendship are weaknesses to be deplored since no one can be ultimately trusted. Robinson, with his frightening eyes and large ugly mouth, makes this human scum fascinating to watch - a cheap little monster in expensive suits, a moral nonentity with a big gun.

Douglas Fairbanks Jr does a fine job with what little the script gives him as Rico&apos;s longtime buddy; the bland nature of his performance contrasts nicely to Robinson&apos;s florid acting style. Even more compelling is Glenda Farrell in an important early role as Fairbanks&apos; girlfriend - this talented actress would soon become one of Hollywood&apos;s premiere tough talking brassy blondes.

Stanley Fields, Sidney Blackmer & George E. Stone all deliver vivid portraits of crooks & criminals that Rico must intimidate or use. Special mention should be made of William Collier Jr who gives a touching portrayal as the mob&apos;s getaway driver who loses his nerve and attempts to go straight.

Movie mavens will recognize an unbilled Lucille La Verne as the old crone who intimidates Rico near the end of the picture.

Little Dieter Needs to Fly,"German-American Dieter Dengler discusses his service as a U.S. naval pilot in the Vietnam War. Dengler also revisits the sites of his capture and eventual escape from the hands of the Viet Cong, recreating many events for the camera.","After I finished watching this intriguing documentary, I wondered; how much of Little Dieter was in Herzog, and vice versa? For Werner Herzog(and Dieter likewise) seemed capable of evoking a whole spectrum of human emotions in his works, however idiosyncratic they looked on the surface.

 In this story of an American immigrant from Germany, who piloted a plane in Nam, got shot down, interned, escaped and survived, we got to see how the man lived, before, during and after this arduous period of ordeal. All that insurmountable pain and uphill battles might not have fazed the man, but it certainly took its toll. Memories of these experiences continue to haunt his being. Case in point, due in part to enduring that period of torture and starvation, the man now stocked his cellar with lotsa food in case he&apos;s ever locked in.... 

Could the above have been a reason why Herzog chose to film this man? A man seemingly steeped in personality dysfunctions but was in fact merely a wounded man living his life, the only way he knew how? Could it be that Dieter&apos;s story also somehow mirrored Herzog&apos;s life and outlook? Damned if I am to know the answers to these universal mysteries...

 Much had been said about the questionable sanity of Werner Herzog. But during my intensive devouring of his films over this last week, I began to see a pattern unravelling. This man had many profound insights to share with us all about humanity. And they often transcended intellectual boundaries. Through those intangibly twisted tales he weaved, he conveyed his ideas to us all lucidly, impactfully. And he did them all without ever gauzing the profusion in his bleeding heart. This man was never afraid of showing his earnest emotions nor was he afraid of breaking cinematic conventions. If one cared enough to be touched by the man, he or she will do so without safety nets. I did. Nice. 

Yes, its no longer fashionable in these times of impenetrable cynicism to embrace a man like Werner Herzog. But I am fascinated by this psycho visionary nonetheless. And I will follow the man to the very pits of wherever he&apos;s heading. As long as its somewhere I&apos;m willing to go, that is....heh.",,"['Documentary', 'Biography', 'Drama']","['five word title', 'military and war documentary', 'escape', 'vietnam', 'vietnam war']",1998-10-02,['Werner Herzog'],"['Dieter Dengler', 'Werner Herzog', 'Eugene Deatrick']",['Werner Herzog']

They don&apos;t need to encapsulate a moral lesson, they don&apos;t need to have a meaning, they don&apos;t need to tell you what&apos;s good or bad (even if in the end the bad guy learns his lesson here).

I&apos;m glad society was much more open a couple of years ago, not so shocked about everything and that it was possible to made a film like this.

Steve Buscemi is right at home in this film, his influence rubs off on the support actors, and his stress is convincing. This film makes you squirm but laugh - unlike conventional comedies - in this film you identify and live with the actors.

The screenplay timing is superb and taunts the audience to an almost stressful level. Offset this with lots of comedy and you&apos;re left with a powerful mix. You are almost relieved when it is over... but you are left with great memories of a strange but enjoyable film.

London in the Raw,,"A typical effort from Arnold Miller.As usual the title,advertising and trailer hint at a lot more than is actually in the film.The film is a pot pourri of unrelated items.It starts off with women going to a gym,a man having his bald head repaired,a visit to a pub restaurant,a Cypriot social evening,a belly dancer,a Jewish amateur dramatic society,and of course semi naked women sitting still posing.There is quite a lot of music and I would add that it is totally unerotic.This film would have been shown at the Compton cinemas,most of which were in London&apos;s west end.One can only guess what the punters would have made of it.On the disc released by the BFI there are a number of extras including 25 minute short Strippers,which really takes you behind the scenes at a strip club of the period.",3,['Documentary'],"['england', 'united kingdom', 'cold war era', 'female full frontal nudity', 'strip show']",,"['Arnold L.

Kozure Ôkami: Sanzu no kawa no ubaguruma,"Trailed by a clan of female ninja, Ogami is paid to assassinate a clan traitor accompanied by three killers known as the Gods of Death.","I thought the first movie was extremely grim. This one had a more thoughtful approach. I like that Lone Wolf confronted the sword woman five times. It was interesting that each confrontation was different, and that he spared her life. She was sworn to kill him but respected him, and had compassion for his son, when she could have tried to kill the boy. There were nuances as to their code of honor, their obligations, and their personal morality. There were a couple of funny moments relating to the little boy and his participation in the various battles. The use of the boy for some humor was a plus.

The fighting scenes were mostly good, but not as good as the Zatoichi movies which I love and have seen them all. The bloody effects were pretty bad in some scenes, as the injured (killed) samurai sometimes started bleeding many seconds after they were stabbed or sliced. In one scene, Lone Wolf impales two guys at the same time. One of them immediately starts spraying lots of blood from his wound. The other guy gets a trickle of blood dripping out. It would have been more impressive if the double-impalement lead to double sprays of blood.

Several heads were sliced open, and the last one looked like a venus flytrap popping open, and there were no brains, eyes, or other material visible, it looked totally silly. Then a single spray of blood shot straight up into the air from the middle of the head. Laughable and really bad special effects.

Otherwise, the film was pretty good. It had a lot of action, some good story lines, and some humor.",10,"['Action', 'Adventure', 'Drama']","['samurai', 'ninja', 'opening action scene', 'ambush', 'battle']",1972-04-22,['Kenji Misumi'],"['Tomisaburô Wakayama', 'Kayo Matsuo', 'Minoru Ôki']","['Kazuo Koike', 'Goseki Kojima']"

Lost After Dark,"In this clever homage to &apos;80s slasher films, a group of teenagers looking to party get stranded when their ride breaks down and end up being stalked by a cannibalistic killer.","Capitalizing on 80&apos;s slasher genre can work as a premise of satiric horror, but it doesn&apos;t excuse outdated delivery such as stiff acting and poor pacing. The idea is to put myriad of old horror antics in attempt to create gore as well as slight comedy. Unfortunately, it&apos;s not even better than actual 80&apos;s cheap movie.

Plot is as simple as they come, a group of students venture to the woods in the most dire condition possible, then meets a psycho killer. It&apos;d be a decent popcorn flick if not for, mostly, the jarring acting. The movie goes on a way to depict stereotypes, making the actors spew nonsense in incredibly overly dramatic way. Some of the scenes resemble blooper of actual classic slasher or cheesy commercial. Audience already knows that it&apos;s a throwback, so there&apos;s no reason to force every smirk or gasp to be ridiculous.

The entire thing looks plastic, down to the script which not only sounds random but incredibly pretentious. So, when the characters talk about fate or other serious issue, it&apos;s far from believable. Not to mention the movie spends quite some time for these characters, especially on first half, to make audience invest of stale personalities. Granted, one or two might be relatable, but as they interact with other characters the shallow performance underwhelms any distinct trait.

At the very least, it does partially deliver the expected gore. There are a few timidly shocking moments, but even those are simple stabbing or head crushing, certainly nothing you haven&apos;t seen before. For fans it may be mildly amusing, casual viewer might not be so lenient.

Lost After Dark tries to give a homage, or cheap imitation of classic slasher, however it only trips and falls to the same flaws from three decades ago.",4,['Horror'],"['retro', 'retro horror', 'satire', 'slasher', 'dark humor']",2015-08-21,['Ian Kessner'],"['Sarah Fisher', 'Mark Wiebe', 'Jesse Camacho']","['Ian Kessner', 'Bo Ransdell']"

Lost in Translation,A faded movie star and a neglected young woman form an unlikely bond after crossing paths in Tokyo.,"Being in a profession where there is constant noise, I enjoyed this movie for a very odd reason. The characters are pulling away from a hyped up society, away from a world, much of which is based on needless, trivial noise. Everywhere they go there is more numbing action. Watching the director of the commercial gyrating, trying to act like a real film director, despite the fact that they are doing a 30 second liquor commercial, typifies some of what this movie is about, a world where people are worn into the ground by a type A culture that is as vapid and unnecessary as we can imagine. I thought the Bill Murray character developed tremendously. While this trip to Japan was excruciatingly dull (money isn&apos;t everything), I believe that he began to see things he hadn&apos;t seen before. I liked that while he was struggling with his marriage, the crises were simple, day to day things that living brings to us. The young woman he meets shows through a whimsical kindness, that he is worth something. She is refreshing to look at an to be with. He, like many middle aged men, has self doubts. Because she has a sense of purity and can talk to him honestly about her world and his, he should go back to his life a little more sustained.",8,"['Comedy', 'Drama']","['older man younger woman relationship', 'loneliness', 'american in tokyo', 'insomnia', 'language barrier']",2003-10-03,['Sofia Coppola'],"['Bill Murray', 'Scarlett Johansson', 'Giovanni Ribisi']",['Sofia Coppola']

The Lost Weekend,The desperate life of a chronic alcoholic is followed through a four-day drinking bout.,"From the first shot of a bottle hanging from a drunk&apos;s apartment, we realize we are about to see a clever addict and a weekend of his demented exploits. Ray Milland has an honest face, not unlike Jimmy Stewart&apos;s, however, with this character it is only skin-deep. The great thing about his performance and the film as a whole, is that his face will gradually change, becoming dark and chilly, just like Stewart&apos;s in IT&apos;S A WONDERFUL LIFE. Stewart had lost his life momentarily. Milland has lost his soul to the bottle and he will stop at nothing to quench his thirst.

This really is a textbook example of the alcoholic&apos;s lies and schemes, a precursor to LEAVING LAS VEGAS, although there are people in this film who care about the drinker from the beginning. He just can&apos;t stop and we start to lose whatever sympathy we had for him because of how he treats other people. This is a drunk with a sober man wanting to come out, but Wilder&apos;s script dives deeply into the unpredictable outcomes of most alcoholics.

LOST WEEKEND was innovative and was almost never released because test audiences could not take the film&apos;s realism. The hospital sequence retains its horror, and Milland&apos;s withdrawal-induced hallucination of a rat in the wall was like him looking in the mirror. See this movie and you will come away with a completely informed and scary anthology of the antics of a hopeless alcoholic. This is amazing considering it came out of the old Hollywood system.",10,"['Drama', 'Film-Noir']","['suicidal thoughts', 'alcoholism', 'alcoholic', 'delirium', 'addiction']",,['Billy Wilder'],"['Ray Milland', 'Jane Wyman', 'Phillip Terry']","['Charles R.

A Life in the Balance,"In Mexico City, a poor single father is mistaken for a serial killer by the local cops, but the man&apos;s son stumbles upon the real killer and tries to warn the police after being abducted.","Ricardo Montalban and Anne Bancroft star, but Lee Marvin steals the picture in my opinion.

Marvin plays the villain so expertly that it&apos;s hard not to hate him.

He kidnaps a young boy, Paco, son of Ricardo Montalban&apos;s character, Antonio.

And becomes obsessed with Paco, dragging him across Mexico City, evading the entire 500 man Mexico City police department, highjacking a city bus which he promptly wrecks, and winding up at the world famous University of Mexico City as the backdrop for the exciting grand finale.

The little boy is also quite effective, much of the movie depends on him, and he doesn&apos;t fail to deliver.

Anne Bancroft&apos;s character is never given a chance to be fully developed, but she proves her motherly instincts at the very last moment, ignoring her own safety, risking her own life.

Anne Bancroft, Ricardo Montalban, Paco and Lee Marvin are the whole enchilada. The dozens of police officers do a lot of running, and chasing, but are not much more than uniformed props.

The lady who played the woman in the pawnshop was also quite effective.

The crumby title doesn&apos;t express the definite Noir thrust of the movie.

Not even close to being one of the best of Film Noir.

The worst part was the speech Ricardo Montalban gave at the conclusion of the picture still in character, as if he had to explain everything we had just seen.

Lust for Life,The life of brilliant but tortured artist Vincent van Gogh.,"Irving Stone wrote his book &apos;Lust for Life&apos; in 1934 and MGM obtained the film rights to it in 1946, long before there was any intention to create this film. Biographical films about the lives of artists were not regarded as likely to be financially viable, and at the time Van Gogh, who had only sold one painting in his lifetime, was not really well known to the public or regarded as the most promising subject for such a film. This changed following a very successful exhibition of his works in 1955 and MGM decided to commission Minnelli to direct the film for them, but they had little time left to create it as their film rights to the book expired at the end of 1955. This greatly complicated the production. For example, rights to create still reproductions of almost 200 of Van Gogh&apos;s works for this film had to be negotiated with all the museums, galleries and private collectors world-wide who owned them, the pictures then had to be copied by special still cameras requiring only low illumination levels, and printed as large transparencies that could be back-lit for filming in any scenes where they were visible. Minnelli was a good choice as Director - previously a stage designer he was known for artistic sensibilities and an eye for colour. In his memoirs Minnelli reports two major battles with the studio moguls, one he won - the other he lost. Minnelli knew the Metrocolor process used at MGM generated saturated colours which would be too garish for this film. He had recently finished filming Brigadoon using Anscocolor stock and insisted this was what was needed, but Anscocolor cine stock had just been discontinued. MGM eventually agreed to buy up the last 300,000 feet of unused Anscocolor stock available, and to set up a laboratory in which it could be processed. Minnelli also bitterly opposed working in CinemaScope format, claiming the large aspect ratio was incompatible with most paintings, and would also spoil the intimacy of many of the scenes to be filmed; but he was over-ruled on this.

Half a century later we are in a position to appreciate how right he was over both these issues. Like most viewers my first reactions to a film I am watching usually relate to the quality of the film-script, the direction and the acting. If these are acceptable I know I am likely to feel that I have seen a very good film. But film stock remains very important - as a still photographer myself I am well aware of the need to evaluate whether a particular shot should be made on, for example, Fuji&apos;s Sensia, Astia or Velvia emulsions - the wrong choice usually destroys the effect the photographer is striving for. It is the same with movies - I can recall just four films (&apos;The Riddle of the Sands&apos;,&apos; Laura, les Ombres de l&apos;Ete&apos;, &apos;Black Narcissus&apos; and &apos;Lust for Life&apos;) where one of my first reactions has been admiration for the atmospheric qualities and colour rendering of the photography. There may have been others but such films are certainly not very numerous. Although the opening credits of L4L still attribute the colour to Metrocolor, this film could not have succeeded as it did if MGM had been unable to obtain the Ansco stock that was actually used. As for aspect ratio, we have only to compare the VHS version with the new widescreen DVD to confirm that Minnelli&apos;s vision was correct (and this is of course after he did everything possible to utilise sequences which take maximum advantage of the widescreen presentation that he was forced to adopt.)

The film-script has been criticised for inaccuracies in Van Gogh&apos;s life as shown (unfairly as it is based on Irving Stone&apos;s book, which is normally classed as a novel rather than a biography. MGM might have done better to write an independent film-script and present their film as a biography- not as a film of a novel. What probably prevented this was recognition that they would then be responsible for any errors.) As written it is a very powerful depiction of the gradually increasing intensity of Van Gogh&apos;s commitment to his art, which increasingly became the only significant driving force in everything he did. The two hour overall running time is just about right - the emotional impact of watching the gradual disintegration of Van Gogh&apos;s personality might have become quite distressing for some viewers if the film has been a great deal longer. 

The acting is exceptional. Kirk Douglas, a remarkable look-alike to extant pictures of Van Gogh, put everything into his effort to create a believable picture of a man with an increasingly fanatical drive which eventually overwhelmed him. It earned him an Oscar nomination, but not an award. This, I feel, was not his fault - Van Gogh was too insecure to interact normally with others and this would have showed in his whole bearing, something an individual as secure and stable as Kirk could not easily emulate. An actor is by nature an extreme extrovert and trying to take the part of an introvert is very difficult - when the introvert is both fanatical and unbalanced it probably becomes impossible. This makes it hard to become involved with Kirk&apos;s portrayal of the role in the same way that one would have done with Van Gogh himself. Anthony Quinn&apos;s Best Supporting Actor Oscar award for his role as Paul Gauguin was well deserved. There were also memorable performances by James Donald as Theo and Pamela Brown as Christine. Theo&apos;s anguish in the deathbed sequence came over very effectively. The direction and camera work, although not faultless, were both of an extremely high standard. All in all, anyone interested either in modern painting or in the lives of modern painters will find this a most rewarding film to watch.",8,"['Biography', 'Drama']","['painter', 'mental illness', 'painting', 'suicide', 'liberation theology']",1956-11-30,"['Vincente Minnelli', 'George Cukor']","['Kirk Douglas', 'Anthony Quinn', 'James Donald']","['Norman Corwin', 'Irving Stone']"

Though what&apos;s most fascinating is that it&apos;s no more about crime than how easily a life can be corrupted, turning an individual into a criminal. Daniel Morgan is a confused, violent character but we sympathize with him nonetheless 

All in all it&apos;s an interesting, near forgotten piece of film-making.

Mad Love,The wild and sexy story of two passionate young people who take to the road for the incredible adventure of their lives.,"Matt Leland (Chris O&apos;Donnell) has talkative best friend Eric (Matthew Lillard). Matt is taken with new girl Casey Roberts (Drew Barrymore). They begin a wild relationship. She gets suspended and her parents put her away. He helps her escape the psych ward and they go on a road trip. However, her manic depressive state gets more volatile and beyond his ability to help.

I never bought Chris O&apos;Donnell as a romantic lead. He&apos;s too white bread and doesn&apos;t have the passion. This is love at first sight and who can blame him. Drew can do that to many men but I don&apos;t see them as Romeo and Juliet. Drew is convincing with mental illness but it is a little overwrought. I&apos;m not really that invested in this relationship.

Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome,"After being exiled from the most advanced town in post apocalyptic Australia, a drifter travels with a group of abandoned children to rebel against the town&apos;s queen.","Mad Max 3 has shown me that this Australian film franchise is continuing to be big and successful. Part way through watching this movie, I felt that Mel Gibson was born to play the role of Mad Max, as he suits the character that was created. I was thinking that this film might have had a very &apos;Hollywood&apos; feel to it. But to my surprise, I was glad to see and hear a very Australian flavour continuing, which has accompanied all the Mad Max movies to date.

 Two men enter. One man leaves. That is the law in Bartertown&apos;s Thunderdome arena. But lawmaker Aunty Entity will soon add another: Do not get Max mad! Max is back as the hero who takes on the barbarians of the post-nuclear future - and this time becomes the savior of a tribe of lost children. However, the power-mad Aunty Entity, a dominatrix, is determined to use Max to tighten her stranglehold on Bartertown.

What was lacking in the second of the Mad Max movies was its script, which seemed to be underdeveloped, so I was hoping that the &apos;Beyond Thunderdome&apos; would be better. Thankfully it was, as there was a lot more dialogue, some intriguing characters, and an even better story, which contained a lot of entertaining elements. I especially like the location of Bartertown, as it still had an &apos;Australian feel&apos; to it, the idea of the Thunderdome was well explained and shown through the story. Then to have Max, be the protector of all these children made the story just that much better. MM3 was written once again by George Miller and Terry Hayes.

But George Miller also did so much more. He directed the third movie, giving it all the necessary touches that have made Mad Max, the movies they are today. Helping Miller in the director&apos;s chair is another George, director George Ogilvie. Having two directors I think only enhances the movie all the more. I like the way we see the famous &apos;Thunderdome&apos; fighting scene, as Miller and Ogilvie focused very much on that event and the many elements within it. I also like the grand view of the open desert that we see numerous times through out the film, as both directors certainly wanted us to see that the conditions surrounding Bartertown were pretty harsh to both humans and animals. Credit for this section of the movie has to also go to the cinematographer, Dean Semler, who shot some great camera angles of the deserts.

MM3 also had some fine performers. Mad Max (Mel Gibson) shows that he is still a force to be reckoned with. His introduction to Aunty Entity (Tina Turner) was highly entertaining, as Max takes an impossible situation to show that he is a person not to be taken lightly. Max, for part of this movie, has long hair, which I believe gives Max an even more silent, heroic, darker edge to his character. However I was not a big fan of Tina Turner&apos;s performance in the film, as she did not seem at all in her place as an actress, but the look of her character was effective. Tina sings the song &apos;We don&apos;t need another hero&apos; for the movie&apos;s soundtrack.

I also liked the actors with minor roles in the film. Max is told to separate Master-blaster, who is two identities. There is the very small and intelligent Master (Angelo Rossitto), and the very muscular Blaster (Paul Larsson), who Max has the huge encounter with in the Thunderdome. There was also a very Australian feel to this cast. Pigkiller (Robert Grubb) was a peculiar character that I immediately liked. He genuinely wants to help Max&apos;s cause in any way he can. Of the nastier looking guys, you have Ironbar (Angry Anderson), who might not have much to say, but has many lives in the film. In fact, many incidents with him are humorous and breathtaking as well. Back in MM3 is Jedediah (Bruce Spence), who now has a son, Jedediah Jnr. (Adam Cockburn). Max and Jedediah have a very clear understanding, which continues here. Another major component to the film is the use of pigs. I will not say why they are used here, just that I liked their presence every time they were onscreen.

There are some amazing scenes attached to MM3. I have to agree that the film contains one the best movie fight scenes ever, as Max and gladiatorial Blaster face off with maces, chainsaws and anything not nailed down inside Thunderdome. It is truly an exhilarating scene to see playing out, (although I cringed when I saw Max drop-start the chainsaw). However the customary car chase scene, which MM is famous for, was not as great here, as in the previous two movies. But it did have the fun sequence showing Ironbar barely escaping with his life many times. I enjoyed the lead up scenes to the car chase, as they had a lot of action and involvement of many people from the cast.

While, I like the characters we see in this movie, I do not believe they are as well developed as the people created for the first movie, as they were a lot easier to get to know, love and understand. I guess the big question after this movie is, &apos;which Mad Max is better, one or three?&apos; I am still a bigger fan of the original, as it is a great film, showing that a small budget filmmaking can be very successful. That does not mean I am not a fan of this film, because I am. &apos;Beyond Thunderdome&apos; had such a fine conclusion, that perhaps they should have left the &apos;status quo&apos;. But hearing that a 4th film in the series is being made as we speak, says to me, that Mel Gibson, George Miller and his talented crew have more in store for Mad Max fans. I cannot wait!

But the film also does not fall into the trap of becoming a self-indulgent showpiece, which, with so many years of work the filmmakers put into this, might as well have happened. 

Additional props must go to the music score, which fits the film&apos;s mood perfectly and greatly enhances the spectrum of emotions the viewer will experience while watching Madame Tutli-Putli.

Madman,A legendary psychopathic murderer stalks a summer camp.,"I think that a complete guide of the slasher subgenre it&apos;s almost impossible to write: because of its very simple&cheap formula, a lot of movie have been produced since the beginning of the 80s.

Among these, one of the earliest and most appreciable is MADMAN by Giannone, which is a very honest low-budget flick with some variations from the original (Cunningham&apos;s) model and a more fairy-tale oriented atmosphere (the nominal villain really looks like an ogre). Of course, as many other similar features, it has its flaws - acting, for example - but that&apos;s not what you seek from such kind of movies. The special effects are pretty well done and they&apos;re obtained with very simple solutions. Giannone&apos;s style is good, especially in the use of deep focus and the cinematography is genuinely inventive (the green painted leaves!). Eventually, it&apos;s better than many others.",5,"['Horror', 'Thriller']","['summer camp', 'slasher', 'axe murderer', 'male nudity', '1980s']",1983-02-18,['Joe Giannone'],"['Gaylen Ross', 'Tony Nunziata', 'Harriet Bass']","['Joe Giannone', 'Gary Sales']"
Maggie,"A teenage girl in the Midwest becomes infected by an outbreak of a disease that slowly turns the infected into cannibalistic zombies. During her transformation, her loving father stays by her side.","&apos;MAGGIE&apos;: Four Stars (Out of Five)

An indie zombie flick, made on a budget of just $4 million, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and Abigail Breslin! It was directed by first time feature filmmaker Henry Hobson and written by first time feature film writer John Scott 3. The movie is actually more of a dramatic character study, than an action or horror film, dealing with the relationship between a teenage girl, in the Midwest, and her loving father. The catch is that the girl is infected with a deadly zombie virus. It&apos;s definitely not the type of movie that a lot of Schwarzenegger fans are expecting, but I really liked it. 

The story is set in a small Midwest town, where a virus, called the necroambulist virus, has broken out. It slowly turns it&apos;s victims into zombies and the government deals with the problem by throwing &apos;the infected&apos; into isolation wards. Maggie (Breslin) is a young teenage girl, who was recently infected by the disease. Her father, Wade (Schwarzenegger), must do his best to care for her, in her last days, and also come to terms with what must be done, when she finally changes.

I wasn&apos;t sure what exactly to expect, going into this movie. The premise, and idea of Arnold Schwarzenegger starring in a low-budget zombie drama flick, were both very intriguing to me. I am a little disappointed it doesn&apos;t have more action, and gruesome thrills, but it is a very well made drama film. Arnold gives, arguably, his best performance to date, and Breslin is pretty impressive as well. I wish there would have been a little more to the story, than just another drama flick about a terminally ill teen, and her relationship with her friends and family. It&apos;s almost like a zombie version of &apos;MY SISTER&apos;S KEEPER&apos; or &apos;THE FAULT IN OUR STARS&apos;, except with a little Schwarzenegger thrown in as well. I think he&apos;s making a lot of wise career choices lately, and he&apos;s starting to resemble Clint Eastwood, more and more, with each movie. This isn&apos;t a great film but it is a nice entry in Arnold&apos;s impressively expanding resume.

Of course, Denzel Washington was a good main character, however, unbelievable given that historically, the west was populated largely by people of Caucasion and Mexican descent. I feel that the casting of mostly minorities was another pathetic attempt at re-writing history with a broad, multi-colored and politically correct brush that is all too common today. This movie largely lacked character development and I wished there was more substance to the film. What can I say? Like many other movies released in the last 10 years, it had plenty of action and fast-moving scenes, but fell short of becoming something memorable.

The Maid,"An American teenager, who while visiting his estranged dad in England, gets into an emotional relationship with the older foreign maid working there.","I watched this movie not knowing what to expect.

And it was a really refreshing change from watching the over-fed Hollywood blockbusters, that in the late time, tend to look-alike.

I won&apos;t give away much, but it is about somewhat forbidden fruit, love that was not suppose to happen. Young guy with a bright future falls for an older maid. The maid recognized many similarities between her and the young boy, and he reminded her of her own forgotten hopes and dreams. On the other side, he found someone who understands him.

Can they make it, can their love stand the test of time? Well, I recommend you to go and watch this nice movie and enjoy in it, as I have enjoyed.

Chaplin, in a pre-Tramp role, shows some of the things that would eventually make him one of the most recognizable figures in the world, such as keeping an opponent away from him by using his cane during a fight). There&apos;s very little (ok, no) plot development.

This is a Keystone short, so there is quite a bit of slapstick humor. Perhaps it&apos;s due to this movie being over 90 years old when I saw this, but I could not tell what exactly happened between Chaplin and the reporter (played by director Henry Lehrman). There are a few interesting parts.

If you are a fan of Chaplin and can&apos;t get enough of his work or a fan of silent slapstick comedies, this might be worth a look.

The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,"In the early 1960s, CIA agent Napoleon Solo and KGB operative Illya Kuryakin participate in a joint mission against a mysterious criminal organization, which is working to proliferate nuclear weapons.","I just saw a sneak preview of this movie and I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed it. I will have to preface this review by saying that I have not seen the original show, so I can&apos;t say whether this paid appropriate homage to the original, or if it is a bastardization.

The opening sequence chase scene featured heavily in the previews, but surprisingly the trailer did not ruin the scene. It actually came across even more crisp and clever in the theater and was a great beginning for the movie. It perfectly sets the tone of the two spy characters and establishes their respectful rivalry.

The movie isn&apos;t wall-to-wall action, but there are enough action scenes to keep the pace lively. There is also a second chase scene towards the end of the movie that is perhaps even better than the opening scene&apos;s chase.

I think the real strength of the movie is the comedic element. The banter is quite snappy and a few of the lines I couldn&apos;t hear because of the laughter filling the theater. In particular Henry Cavill delivered as the slick cool spy Solo.

Armie Hammer also delivered as the Russian counterpart, Illya. In many ways he plays the straight man to Cavill&apos;s comedian, which is actually the harder part to play. It was also apparently the harder part to direct and/or film since a few of his scenes came across as a bit clichéd.

The third part of the group is Gaby, played by Alicia Vikander. The part she played is the most uneven of the group. To an extent it seemed like they couldn&apos;t quite figure out her role, so she ended up being a bit of a third wheel. That being said, she didn&apos;t detract from the movie, and serves as another foil for the two main characters.

As long as I&apos;m mentioning actors/actresses, I have to say that Hugh Grant did a superb job in a relatively minor role. Also Elizabeth Debicki did an excellent job as the female villain.

Since this is a period piece, I think it&apos;s important to point out that they went through a lot of effort to get things right. Fortunately for me, they did such a good job that it, that it didn&apos;t feel like I was being beaten over the head with the 60&apos;s. There were a number of iconic outfits, but overall it was subtle enough that I wasn&apos;t jarred out of the movie, which says a lot about the great job they did.

Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, and would recommend it for anyone who enjoys spy movies, or action/comedies. Also, if you&apos;ve seen the trailer and thought it showed promise, then you should definitely see the movie, because the trailer doesn&apos;t show all (or even most) of the good parts, but gives a good sampling.",,"['Action', 'Adventure', 'Comedy']","['cia agent', 'spy', 'kgb agent', 'cold war', 'kgb']",2015-08-14,['Guy Ritchie'],"['Henry Cavill', 'Armie Hammer', 'Alicia Vikander']","['Guy Ritchie', 'Lionel Wigram', 'Jeff Kleeman']"

The Man from Laramie,Newcomer Will Lockhart defies the local cattle baron and his sadistic son by working for one of his oldest rivals.,"I like Jimmy Stewart a lot, and like a vast majority of his movies, and when I saw that this was going to be on television I told yes I must see it. After seeing The Man from Laramie, I thought it wasn&apos;t absolutely outstanding but it was very good all the same. The story, about a man who seeks vengeance on the man who sold the guns that killed his brother, has its unfocused spots and while Cathy O&apos;Donell looked lovely her acting wasn&apos;t that great at times, I found her somewhat bland. That said though, The Man from Laramie is beautifully made, the cinematography is crisp and the scenery is breathtaking. And George Duning&apos;s score is excellent, and the dialogue has some bite. Also there are some very good performances, Jimmy Stewart is excellent in the lead of Will Lockhart and Donald Crisp is brilliant as Alec Waggoman, who along with his sons played respectively by Arthur Kennedy and Alex Nicol dominate the action. Antony Mann&apos;s direction is tougher than most of the other psychological westerns that he directed, and here it works. Then there are some effective scenes such as when Will gets shot in the hand and the final shoot-out on the cliffs. Overall, not flawless but very satisfying western, telling of anguish and vengeance. 8/10 Bethany Cox",8,"['Drama', 'Western']","['native american', 'repeating rifle', 'ranch', 'sheriff', 'action hero']",1955-08-31,['Anthony Mann'],"['James Stewart', 'Arthur Kennedy', 'Donald Crisp']","['Philip Yordan', 'Frank Burt', 'Thomas T.

He has no facial movements and a single expression, as if he is paralyzed. They befriend him but Schallert soon screws things up by cutting off the air supply to the poor guy. Schallert seems to think that somehow this creature will make him rich and famous, though we&apos;re never sure how that is going to happen. This guy is connected to the planet that is going to launch a full scale invasion. The reporter goes to the local authorities. People have been disappearing and there is a lot of tension.

Man in the Shadow,"Virgil Renchler owns most of the town, providing a thriving economy. When his men go too far and kill one of his migrant workmen, the sheriff goes after him, even if it means his job and everyone else&apos;s.","With the debate over illegal immigration and the concern that it is mostly coming from south of the American border, Man in the Shadow is a film that has assumed a serious relevance for us today.

Jeff Chandler is the sheriff of a small southwestern town and a Mexican migrant worker, Martin Garralaga, has brought news of a homicide committed by white ranch hands on the property of his employer Orson Welles. It seems that a young Mexican was paying to much attention to Welles&apos;s daughter, Colleen Miller, and Welles wanted to teach him the error of his ways. Of course Leo Gordon and John Larch go too far and now a murder has to be covered up.

It becomes two murders when witness Garralaga also turns up dead. Though Welles and his Golden Empire Ranch have a stranglehold on the local economy and the town&apos;s leading citizens beg Chandler not to pursue the case, Chandler doggedly goes ahead anyway. He&apos;s the sheriff and it&apos;s his duty.

Chandler in this modern western is a standup straight arrow sheriff in the mold of Gary Cooper or John Wayne. He takes his oath of office quite seriously. And what happens to him during the course of the investigation makes the townspeople want to re-examine just how much they want to kowtow to Welles and his hired thugs.

Mario Siletti, the town barber and one of the few who backs Chandler without reservation, puts it best in that his father fled from a guy who was running Italy in the Twenties the same way Welles was running this corner of the USA. 

Orson Welles just by his appearance in what is a B picture lent enormous prestige to it. This was one of those acting jobs he did trying to earn money to finance his own projects. But Welles never gave less than 100% of himself in anything he did. His portrait of a malevolent Ben Cartwright is a great piece of work.

Tarde para la ira,"A hard-working single mother and wife of a getaway driver who is about to be released is approached by an unassuming and gentle man, completely unaware though of his inscrutable and utterly impelling motives.","The viewer totally relates with Jose&apos;s fury and his all-consuming desire to avenge the death of his fiancée and comatose father. His outlook and mien changed markedly when her fiancée dies gazing at him with tears rolling down her cheek.

He was able to carry out his plan only after the driver of the getaway car is released from prison 8 years later. Jose&apos;s secret plan is simple and he carries it out methodically and without remorse. It&apos;s so secret that even Ana, Curro&apos;s girlfriend, was clueless about it.

The film is simply a story of revenge. But what&apos;s so different is how the director treats it. It feels as if you&apos;re there beside Jose as he goes about his bloody business knowing fully that there&apos;s no turning back for him.

Great acting from the main characters. Antonio Dela Torre inhabits his role totally. And you emphatize with Curro who&apos;s become helpless although initially the viewer might have thought he&apos;s fearless.

And there&apos;s this twist in the end that you didn&apos;t see coming. Clever touch from the writer.

Man on Wire,,"We saw this film at the Edinburgh Film Festival, it&apos;s European premier, and it was a packed audience. Unfortunately due to an error, the reels were swapped in the middle of the film, which threw the timing a bit but to be honest the poor organisers looked so miserable as they apologised that no one minded, and the film was just as beautiful as it should have been.

We were lucky enough to have a Q&A with the director and the star, Philippe Petit where we all asked the same old questions; &apos;how did it feels?&apos; &apos;are you scared of death?&apos; &apos;what made you do it?&apos; but what made the experience and the film so refreshing was the personality of Petit. Of course you would assume he is a rampant egotist, he was a very good looking young man, talented, with a raft of friends happy to be involved in his dangerous and exciting endevours. Petit is actually incredibly funny and oblivious. I would describe his act not as simply entertainment but as a sublime experience, taking us to the edge of terror and death.

I was worried I&apos;d spend the whole film with clammy hands, watching a guy on a high wire so high up, but his friend describes it so well the feeling you get watching him walk up there, it&apos;s so poetic and peaceful.

This is a very unusual film, very beautiful and exciting.

The Man Who Would Be King,"Two former British soldiers in 1880s India decide to set themselves up as Kings in Kafiristan, a land where no white man has set foot since Alexander the Great.","My friend threw this DVD at my head one night while we were arguing about film. I said all adventure movies left me feeling a little hollow - adventure movies tended to abandon story, really, in favor of plot (important distinction: stories are interesting, plots boring; consequently a film with a story to tell is better than a movie with a plot to move forward). I think he hurled the disc at me out of pure frustration with my point of view. In doing so, he also won the argument.

The Man Who Would Be King is the single greatest adventure film I&apos;ve ever seen. It&apos;s a story - It&apos;s a tale - It&apos;s not a series of plot developments (to me, to go further with this plot/story dichotomy, a plot is mechanical (and sometimes that machine is well-oiled) while a story is organic and feels less contrived (though the story, as organic matter sometimes is, can be rotten)). It&apos;s a very good story at that. The Man Who Would Be King (I believe as a result of its derivation from Kipling) has a depth and development of character that is foreign to most adventure tales. Few films are as rousing as this and few films that are this rousing have nearly as much to say about mankind.

John Huston, of course, is a master of instilling greatness into traditionally tedious genres. He transformed the mystery, the western, the swashbuckler. Why not the adventure story too? As evidenced in The Maltese Falcon and Treasure of the Sierra Madre, Huston can take what might wind up a plot and transform it into a story. He understands that characters - human, conflicted, devious characters - are essential to creating genre pictures that transcend their genre. Without Huston, this film would have undoubtedly faltered; his steady and determined hand guides this film from the hazards of superficiality without sacrificing entertainment and adventure.

He does not create a great film single-handedly though, as Connery and Caine, who both give tremendous performances, bestow upon Peachy and Daniel immense likability despite their scoundrel airs. Caine proves again why he may be the greatest living British actor and Connery reminds us that there&apos;s more to him than 007.

As I said, this is one of the greatest adventure tales brought to the screen. Though some may disagree, in particular my friend who threw the DVD at my head, it&apos;s better than any of the late 30s swashbucklers and better than most shoot-em-ups made since.",,"['Adventure', 'War']","['adventurer', '19th century', 'imperialism', 'execution', 'epic']",1975-12-19,['John Huston'],"['Sean Connery', 'Michael Caine', 'Christopher Plummer']","['John Huston', 'Gladys Hill', 'Rudyard Kipling']"

The Man with the Golden Gun,"James Bond is targeted by the world&apos;s most expensive assassin, while he attempts to recover sensitive solar cell technology that is being sold to the highest bidder.","Altho there&apos;s a lot of hate for this second Moore 007, I never understood it. For a change, most of the witty dialogue works well. I think it&apos;s one of Moore&apos;s best Bond performances.

So let&apos;s break it down: The Good: - Roger Moore is witty and action ready. His fight scene in the belly dancer&apos;s room is pretty good. Tough and violent. Don&apos;t know about that cigar, but it adds a little extra somethin&apos;.


* Herve Villechieze as Knick Knack. Not threatening, but a fun memorable sidekick with lots of playful malevolence. I love it when he shushes Bond.



* Christopher Lee. Nuff said, tho they didn&apos;t build up this character to the level they could have. Where are those deleted scenes between him and Moore (from the trailer and photos)that obviously exist? 



* John Barry. Yes, Lulu&apos;s song is ridiculous. Still, I love the brassy music and this is one of Barry&apos;s most memorable catchy Bond scores. Especially during the karate scenes and the jazzy swing of Scaramenga&apos;s fun parlor.



* Kung fu. The Bond films always lucked out when it came to latching onto the culture of the day. 1974 was the height of kung fu exploitation and Bond was there. Still have BLACK BELT magazine featuring this on the cover...


The Bad: - Miss Goodnight. Giving Bond a ditzy helper...well, bad night.


* Lack of compelling plot. The energy cell and Scaramanga are too loosely tied together and the film shouldn&apos;t have tried to pull a Blofeld at the end.



* Production design. Ken Adams is sorely missing here. And what&apos;s with that ONE GUARD in the massive solar laser set? Missed opportunity there.


The Ugly: - JW Pepper.


* Slide whistle.

Manhattan,,"From a technical standpoint, this film is top-notch - the acting is brilliant, the cinematography is beautiful, and the George Gershwin soundtrack is excellent. 

But the content of the film is another thing. Basically, Woody Allen comes across as an egomaniacal creep who writes parts for himself in order to make him look like he&apos;s God&apos;s gift to women (there are so many references to his sexual prowess one could start a group drinking game based off it). 

And anybody with even a beginner&apos;s understanding of adolescent psychological development knows that men who pursue teenage girls are sick and sadistic bastards who find joy in ruining promising young lives. 

So my summary is: Like the film for its craft, but loathe the creator for his statement.",6,"['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Romance']","['17 year old', 'man wears eyeglasses', 'teenage girl', 'love triangle', 'central park manhattan new york city']",1979-04-25,['Woody Allen'],"['Woody Allen', 'Diane Keaton', 'Mariel Hemingway']","['Woody Allen', 'Marshall Brickman']"
Manhattan Baby,"An archaeologist opens an Egyptian tomb and accidentally releases an evil spirit. His young daughter becomes possessed by the freed entity and, upon arrival back in New York, the gory murders begin.","Manhattan Baby is Fulci&apos;s dive into beautiful imagery. There&apos;s some scenes in this one that are genuinely breathtaking.

A medallion from an archaeological dig leaves a man blind. And a family falls into jeopardy after their son disappears into thin air, and their daughter is possessed by an ancient demon.

If the budget hadn&apos;t been cut for the film, I would imagine that this would be Fulci&apos;s most memorable film. People would think &apos;Manhattan Baby&apos; instead of &apos;Zombie&apos; when they heard the name Lucio Fulci.

Most horror fans haven&apos;t seen this one. It&apos;s true that MB isn&apos;t a film that succumbs to everyone&apos;s tastes. This is simply because in most Italian films, it&apos;s usually style over substance, which in some cases can leave an unseasoned viewer in total awe at the apparent inept plot line before them.

In Italian films (especially), you have to pay very close attention to the whole film. Certain plot definers aren&apos;t given &apos;camera-attention&apos; at crucial times at any given time through any given film. in American films, the camera tells the story. The same can be said for Italian cinema, but a lot of times, it&apos;s much more subtle in its delivery and can leave one feeling incomplete until they eventually see it again.

Anyway, should you watch Manhattan Baby? Sure. I&apos;ll recommend it. It&apos;s a beautifully shot film with hardly any of that Fulci gore we all expected. It also has a great Gothic score that adds tons of surrealistic atmosphere that pulls you in for the most part.

Maniac Cop,A killer dressed in a police uniform begins murdering innocent people on the streets of New York City.,"Maniac Cop is a cool little movie. Made with a small budget and few known actors, I thought that it was going to be stupid and cheap looking. I was wrong. With an original script that features respective characters and a new horror villain, this film was very entertaining and well done. Unlike many horror and action movies of today, this film didn&apos;t need a huge budget to make it good. It just called for good direction and good use of low funds.What really made this film good was not just a cool hero like Bruce Campbell to root for, but the actual reality that some of the things in here could very well happen in real life, adding to the films scary mood. The main point of this flick is about a cop who was killed in prison by his fellow inmates(after being sent their for police brutality and murder)and then somehow returning to life to go back onto the streets and get revenge against not only criminals but against innocent people as well. It is then up to Bruce Campbell and company to put an end to the Maniac Cops murderous rampage and restore peace to the fearful city once again.

Mansion of the Doomed,A mad scientist fills his basement dungeon with victims in an insane attempt to restore his daughter&apos;s eyesight.,"Here is a film that will make your skin crawl.

The transfer from VHS to DVD is poor adding to the creepy, dreamy and eerie feel of the sets and scenes. It adds to the stomach turning queasy feel of the story. 

Injuries of the eyes always make people feel frightened so this really strikes a cord. Seeing the after effects of the transplant surgeries and watching the prep of the surgeries is truly unsettling. 

The make-up effects are OK and I believe there is some real footage being used at some point but what is more disturbing is the doctor&apos;s obsession and the story itself of which I don&apos;t want to give away here. 

Let me just say that the film is hard to watch and I doubt anyone will want to sit through it twice. It&apos;s hard to shake. It leaves greasy little snail tracks on your brain.

Marquis de Sade: Justine,"Penniless and separated from her sister, a beautiful, chaste orphan must endure an endless parade of villains, perverts and degenerates who covet her virtue and life.","On paper, this looks like THE greatest exploitation idea ever! The vicious writings of Marquis de Sade brought to the screen by no less a person then the Godfather of sleaze: Jess Franco! And starring the fabulously outrageous Klaus Kinski as the Marquis. And there are several other aspects about this film that indicate that you&apos;re about to see a triumph in the euro-exploitation field. Like the rather big budget. Franco normally makes the most out of small budgets but here he actually had the chance to work with decent set pieces, costumes and actors. The cast is more than decent with Jack Palance, Howard Vernon (Franco regular) and the ravishing Maria Rohm and Romina Power. This latter one plays the title role and  as well as the entire film  disappoints. The movie is a series of unspectacular events and I never saw Franco this tame! Marquis de Sade: Justine is low on violence, low on nudity and extremely low surprises. Kinski is dreadfully underused and the whole thing is just too correct! Which is NOT Franco&apos;s trademark 

Of course, it&apos;s very stylish and guided by brilliant music. The sets are gorgeous and the two leading ladies remain a joy to stare (preferably when they keep their mouths shut).

The Martian,"An astronaut becomes stranded on Mars after his team assume him dead, and must rely on his ingenuity to find a way to signal to Earth that he is alive and can survive until a potential rescue.","Exceptional sci-fi drama from Ridley Scott about an astronaut (Matt Damon) stranded on Mars and the efforts made to rescue him. As others have pointed out, there&apos;s more than a little bit here that reminds you of movies like Apollo 13 and Cast Away (particularly the former). I fail to see how that&apos;s a knock on it but it&apos;s being presented as such by some. We all come to movies with our own expectations and baggage. I&apos;m not a Scott fanboy expecting him to wow me (his last two films were not great). I just wanted to be entertained and this did the trick. It&apos;s a movie aimed at the masses that is smarter than your average movie aimed at the masses. Maybe it&apos;s not for all nerds (a quick glance at some of the reviews shows a lot of inane nit-picking from people who seem to have no concept of dramatic license), but I didn&apos;t find the movie dumbed-down at all. I also want to say how much I appreciated that this managed to stay remarkably light and positive while still maintaining the tension, proving once again that you don&apos;t have to be depressing to be good drama. If you haven&apos;t seen The Martian yet, you should. It&apos;s a great film with a first-rate cast, good direction, and stellar effects. If you&apos;re just looking for a quality movie to entertain you for a while, this should be something you&apos;ll enjoy.",8,"['Adventure', 'Drama', 'Sci-Fi']","['astronaut', 'space habitat', 'left for dead', 'presumed dead', 'disco music']",2015-10-02,['Ridley Scott'],"['Matt Damon', 'Jessica Chastain', 'Kristen Wiig']","['Drew Goddard', 'Andy Weir']"
Mary of Scotland,The recently widowed Mary Stuart returns to Scotland to reclaim her throne but is opposed by her half-brother and her own Scottish lords.,"The complicated historical background involved in MARY OF Scotland is such that unless you know something about British monarchs you&apos;ll have a hard time knowing where the truth lies in this epic historical romance. But it&apos;s clear that KATHARINE HEPBURN gives a radiant performance as Mary, Queen of Scots--the only drawback being that she never ages a bit over a twenty-five year span. When she goes to her execution, she looks just as young as she did in the opening scene.

It&apos;s a pleasure to report that FREDRIC MARCH breathes a lot of life into his portrayal of Bothwell. Too bad he didn&apos;t exhibit this kind of gusto when he played the title role in ANTHONY ADVERSE the same year. He&apos;s all bravado and robust athletic grace and looks good in his period costumes. Maybe we owe his strong performance to John Ford, but whatever it is, he&apos;s much better here than he was as Anthony Adverse.

JOHN CARRADINE seemed an unusual choice to play Rizzo, the Italian secretary who happens to be a troubadour of sorts, but it&apos;s nice to see him in a more sympathetic role for a change. DONALD CRISP, ALAN MOBRAY, DOUGLAS WALTON and FRIEDA INESCOURT are interesting in supporting roles.

Walton is another actor who shines here, rather than remaining colorless in the background of many a film. He gives a flamboyant performance as Lord Darnley and it&apos;s probably among the best roles he ever had.

FLORENCE ELDRIDGE makes an interesting Queen Elizabeth, less showy in the role than Bette Davis or Flora Robson but still with the right amount of regal spirit.

John Ford directs the first half of the film with his usual authority but things get a little too repetitious and slow-moving in the second half when tedium really settles in before Mary&apos;s final walk to the execution block.

Summing up: A mixed bag, some strong performances, a few strong scenes but overall result is disappointing. Here&apos;s an historical romance that cried out for Technicolor. It manages to look drab in B&W despite the lavish costumes and good photography.",6,"['Biography', 'Drama', 'History']","['mary queen of scots character', 'queen elizabeth i character', 'john knox character', 'character name as title', 'queen elizabeth i']",1936-08-28,"['John Ford', 'Leslie Goodwins']","['Katharine Hepburn', 'Fredric March', 'Florence Eldridge']","['Dudley Nichols', 'Maxwell Anderson', 'Mortimer Offner']"

A classic! This is a MUST see if traveling to Scotland. It may take a few liberties with history, but the story line is intact and accurate. The film takes the viewer from Mary as a teenager in France, through her turbulent reign in Scotland, to her death in England. Mary is unapologetic for her faith or her actions, sorry only that she is imprisoned and prevented from seeing her son, who is a pivotal person in the evolution of Great Britian. Redgrave is wonderful and Jackson does her role very well, despite reviews to the contrary. The scenery is lush and the set depicting of the era.

The Mask,Bank clerk Stanley Ipkiss is transformed into a manic superhero when he wears a mysterious mask.,"Carrey is on top mad-cap form in the Mask, he plays Stanley Ipkiss, a boring Mr. nice guy with a longing for more excitement and success in his life. When he finds a relic of an ancient mask, he gets slightly more than he could have dreamt of; he becomes a cartoonish superhero and at last he can live out his desires; or not! 

This film also introduced the very beautiful Cameron Diaz, and what man can forget her first screen appearance as she breezes in to the bank in all her splendour.

Hilariously funny, cracking special effects and a thoroughly entertaining story, the Mask is a winner people, and it&apos;s an absolute must-see for everyone who likes a bit of Jim Carrey madness.

The Mask of Fu Manchu,Englishmen race to find the tomb of Genghis Khan before the sinister Fu Manchu does.,"The Mask of Fu Manchu is not perfect. The dialogue does feel corny to me, Karen Morley overacts dreadfully that it was difficult to take her hysteria seriously and Lewis Stone makes a piece of wood more animated. However, the black and white cinematography does show crispness and atmosphere and the sets and costumes are beautiful. The score is haunting and while occasionally silly the story is fun and never felt dull. The tortures were both scary and amusing, and I got some entertainment from the scene with the crocodiles. While Charles Starrett is not the most convincing of actors he does make up for it by his sexiness. The two best performances come from Myrna Loy and especially Boris Karloff. Loy is lustful and incredibly magnetic, while Karloff seems to be having the time of his life.

All in all, The Mask of Fu Manchu is a flawed film but it is a decent and fun one. 7/10 Bethany Cox",7,"['Adventure', 'Horror', 'Sci-Fi']","['fu manchu', 'bare chested male bondage', 'bell torture', 'opium den', 'homosexual subtext']",1932-11-05,"['Charles Brabin', 'Charles Vidor']","['Boris Karloff', 'Lewis Stone', 'Karen Morley']","['Irene Kuhn', 'Edgar Allan Woolf', 'John Willard']"

"Like Father, Like Son",The ruthless son of a Mafia kingpin blasts his way through Hollywood on a bloody crime spree.,"The travails and exploits of a Sicilian hit-man, one could accurately refer to The Executioner as a classic example of deservedly obscure and very sleazy 70s exploitation. It&apos;s poorly written and it&apos;s badly acted. Thus, what this film really needed was more action and fewer lines. The story takes into account the rise of XXX pornography, as the main character in The Executioner considers entering into the porn industry as its taking off with the success of Deep Throat, which kind of connects the film&apos;s violent content to sex, both prime exploitation ingredients. As a 70s exploitation film, The Executioner has too much of the downside and not enough of the upside that that term carries with it.

Le colt cantarono la morte e fu... tempo di massacro,A prospector and his drunkard half-brother must fight a rancher and his sadistic son after they seize control of his farm.,"I have loved Fulci&apos;s Zombie films and his other horror films since long before I became interested in spaghetti westerns, so I was naturally very curious about this movie when I discovered that Fulci directed it. After viewing the film, I am very pleased to say that Fulci has directed an excellent western as well.

The music is a perfect example of a great non-Morricone score. Lallo Gori shows that he can have a style of his own and still create a score that is unmistakeably spaghetti western flavored. The theme song is fantastic, and you hear very different variations of it throughout the movie. This gives a feeling of continuity throughout the film without sounding redundant.

Nero and Hilton are both great, as usual. Hilton plays a funny character- a drunk who can shoot faster and straighter than anyone no matter how much he drinks! He can also fight several men at once even though he can&apos;t walk a straight line. The other actors are very good also. Nino Castelnuovo gets to play the most interesting part in the film. His character is truly weird and sadistic, and his preoccupation with playing the organ adds a nice hint of the macabre.

If you are a fan of spaghetti westerns or euro-films in general, do yourself a favor and see this movie.",8,"['Action', 'Thriller', 'Western']","['spaghetti western', 'brother brother relationship', 'western town', 'alcoholic', 'old west']",1968-12-04,['Lucio Fulci'],"['Franco Nero', 'George Hilton', 'Linda Sini']","['Fernando Di Leo', 'Lucio Fulci', 'Enzo Dell&apos;Aquila']"
Sette scialli di seta gialla,A blind pianist tries to figure out who is responsible for a string of murders using a black cat with its claws dipped in curare.,"The first half of this giallo is fairly undistinguished, especially since it blatantly copies Mario Bava (the fashion-house setting being lifted, yet again, from BLOOD AND BLACK LACE [1964]) and Dario Argento (borrowing its blind hero-turned-sleuth from THE CAT O&apos;NINE TAILS [1971]). However, the film is stylish enough (particularly the zoom-happy murder sequences) and the plot convoluted enough (taking in a plethora of shady characters invariably involved in adultery, drug-taking, blackmail and revenge) to overcome its basic lack of originality; the circus-world back-story, then, should perhaps excuse its uniquely far-fetched murder method...though the seven yellow-silk shawls referred to in the original Italian title are equally insignificant! 

The film&apos;s pulsating score by Manuel De Sica (son of neo-realist master film-maker and versatile actor Vittorio De Sica) is serviceable but unremarkable, as is the cast led by Anthony Steffen, Sylva Koscina (in what at first appears to be merely an extended cameo) and Giacomo Rossi-Stuart. Its use of nudity is very discreet (though it doesn&apos;t appear that any cutting was done, I haven&apos;t been able to establish the film&apos;s correct running time; the print I watched was around 94 mins. in PAL format, but some sources list versions running as long as 108 mins.!) and the gore only truly surfaces at the very end (with a particularly nasty shower murder, shamelessly ripping off Hitchcock&apos;s PSYCHO [1960] - but remaining, for my money, one of the genre&apos;s most memorable set-pieces). After the mystery has supposedly been solved (and the revelation of the killer&apos;s identity having thus proved quite lame and lazy, in my opinion), the film manages to pull the rug from under our feet - so much so that I had to watch the ending twice! - by providing one final twist. By the way, the decision to conclude the film in mid-sequence on a freeze-frame is another Argento influence, namely FOUR FLIES ON GREY VELVET (1971)! 

All in all, a giallo more interesting in its borrowings than for any individual achievements - but one that remains eminently watchable just the same.",6,"['Crime', 'Mystery', 'Thriller']","['black cat', 'giallo', 'woman murders a woman', 'murderess', 'cityscape panorama']",1972-08-12,['Sergio Pastore'],"['Anthony Steffen', 'Sylva Koscina', 'Giovanna Lenzi']","['Sandro Continenza', 'Sergio Pastore', 'Giovanni Simonelli']"
Mata Hari,"Mata Hari is a beautiful Dutch-born dancer, working in Paris. It is August 1914 and war between France and Germany seems imminent.

It is August 1914 and war between France and Germany seems imminent. However, she accepts an invitation to travel to Berlin as part of a show. On the train she meets a young German army officer but any thoughts of romance are cut short when a French agent is murdered on the train, while in her company. She is arrested in Germany but freed when the German officer intervenes. While in Germany war breaks out and she is recruited by German Intelligence to spy on France.

I was under no illusions regarding this film, figuring it was mostly made as a skin flick (it stars Sylvia Kristel) but hoping that it was at least historically accurate, thus making it sensual depiction of the life of Mata Hari. Despite my low expectations, however, it is still disappointing.

About the only historically accurate things about this movie are the facts that she was Dutch, lived in the Dutch East Indies for a while, was a dancer, was a German spy and was captured by the French and executed. Everything else is pretty much fiction, created for dramatic effect, and poor effect at that.

Her whole story gets turned into one of her being blackmailed into being a spy, doing it for all love and actually doing her best to undermine the Germans. The idea is to make this into a love-during- wartime drama, but it fails as a romantic drama too - quite unengaging.

It even fails at it primary purpose - as a skin flick. Quite tame in that regard, what there is. The topless female fencing duel was unintentionally quite hilarious though...

It&apos;s essentially a B-grade (at best) skin flick with pretensions of being a romantic biopic, but by trying to encompass so many genres and audiences it fails in all of them.",2,"['Drama', 'Thriller', 'War']","['female frontal nudity', 'sex orgy', 'spy', 'execution by firing squad', 'innocent woman executed']",,['Curtis Harrington'],"['Sylvia Kristel', 'Christopher Cazenove', 'Oliver Tobias']",['Joel Ziskin']

Matchstick Men,A phobic con artist and his protégé are on the verge of pulling off a lucrative swindle when the former&apos;s teenage daughter arrives unexpectedly.,"Ridley Scott and Nicolas Cage deliver some of their best and most intelligent work in a few years, even if Matchstick Men is not quite either&apos;s great contribution for this year in film. What they have done, from Eric Garcia&apos;s novel (adapted by The Griffins), come off rather entertaining, if anything else, and boasts much more thought than would usually be attributed to such a Hollywood film. Nicolas Cage, who plays Roy, part anxious/obsessive compulsive, part sly con man, and part father to a daughter he never knew he had, is a main reason to see this movie. His performance is on par with someone like Jack Nicholson in As Good As It Gets for watch-ability of a truly sad lifestyle, and while Nicholson&apos;s performance was and still is funnier and more charming, Cage gets so into his character, the little mannerisms that pop up more often than expected, that we feel for the guy even as his eyes get twitchy and goes over certain spots in his house like a detective. He may be the most believable obsessive compulsive/con man you&apos;ll see in a long while. Add then an outgoing, occasionally sneaky daughter (Alison Lohman in a performance that skillfully balances sweetness and irritability, sorrow and playfulness in a teenage girl) to the mix, along with a protégé-cum-partner (a cool Sam Rockwell) who has a love/loathe relationship Roy, and there&apos;s the map work for an interesting, if here and there predictable, drama/comedy/crime film. 

 Along with the performances, which are all above average (Cage could be deserved of an Oscar nomination come February, and Lohman could deserve the win possibly), is the visual framework that Scott pushes in each scene. By getting certain camera tricks, and fantastic editing by Dody Dorn (of &apos;Memento&apos; fame), the viewer can really get into Roy&apos;s head even in the smaller scenes, the ones that have little to do with the plot and only to do with the neuroses of Roy (there is even a little touch that I loved when Roy is waiting online early in the film at the supermarket, and the music in the background is an excerpt of the mental hospital music from &apos;Cuckoo&apos;s Nest&apos;). This echoes the style that Scorsese used in Bringing out the Dead, also with Cage, in moving the film to get so into the mood that the story, no matter how intriguing and important, becomes secondary. 

 Which brings me to my own personal beef with the movie, and that is the last fifteen minutes or so. It was clever, up to a point, but as it unfolded, no matter how much I was still emotionally involved with these people, I felt that the twists (I won&apos;t reveal them here) undermined a lot of the rest of the film. It will be based on viewer to viewer, but I just thought that it did a little too much to jab at Roy&apos;s lifestyle. And yet, when I walked out of the theater, though I wasn&apos;t sure I had seen anything spectacular, I didn&apos;t feel like I had wasted time and money either. Matchstick Men is witty, sometimes wonderful moviemaking.",9,"['Comedy', 'Crime', 'Drama']","['criminal', 'child', 'man wears a hospital gown', 'man wears eyeglasses', 'crying man']",2003-09-12,['Ridley Scott'],"['Nicolas Cage', 'Alison Lohman', 'Sam Rockwell']","['Eric Garcia', 'Nicholas Griffin', 'Ted Griffin']"
The Matrix,"When a beautiful stranger leads computer hacker Neo to a forbidding underworld, he discovers the shocking truth--the life he knows is the elaborate deception of an evil cyber-intelligence.","At first, I wasn&apos;t interested in seeing the Matrix. But after hardly hearing any bad reviews for it (and believe me, I hear bad reviews for every movie I enjoy) I decided to give it a try. At first, although I really loved the fights, graphics and characters, the plot confused me. (Anyone confused by the plot at all should go to www.knowthematrix.com and you&apos;ll find out everything you could want to know) By the second time I watched it, I really understood it, which made the movie even more enjoyable.

I really loved this movie. Just about every character, good or bad, is very interesting and cool. The acting was excellent. Even though I think this was Keanu Reeves at his best, the best acting jobs were done by Laurence Fishburne (Morpheus) and Carrie-Anne Moss (Trinity). Hugo Weaving did an excellent job as Agent Smith and Joe Pantoliano was great as Cypher as well.

The plot is one of the best movie plots I&apos;ve seen in a movie. An accountant by day, computer hacker by night guy suddenly finds out that reality as we know it is fake and that we are actually in a giant computer program run by robots (that we created, of course) in order for them to get power. Not only that, but he finds out that he is one who is, according to prophecy, going to put an end to it. The greatest thing is that you learn things just as Neo does, so you can really relate to his character.

My favorite thing about this movie is that no matter how many times you watch it, you will learn more about it. I guarantee this. Some may not like this movie because the plot is too complicated, but I recommend that anyone who enjoys movies should go buy this one right away.",9,"['Action', 'Sci-Fi']","['artificial reality', 'war with machines', 'simulated reality', 'dystopia', 'post apocalypse']",1999-03-31,"['Lana Wachowski', 'Lilly Wachowski']","['Keanu Reeves', 'Laurence Fishburne', 'Carrie-Anne Moss']","['Lilly Wachowski', 'Lana Wachowski']"

Mean Streets,A small-time hood tries to keep the peace between his friend Johnny and Johnny&apos;s creditors.,"&apos;Mean Streets&apos;, the earliest Scorsese film people have heard of, is the result of an on-form film maker, telling a personal story.

One thing to immediately note about &apos;Mean Streets&apos; is the performance of our two leads, Harvey Keitel and Robert De Niro, both looking young and are full of energy. They deliver the goods, big time. They are both so watchable and make up at least half of the movie&apos;s appeal. In fact, &apos;Mean Streets&apos; is an inherently watchable movie overall, helped by some fine dialogue and Scorsese&apos;s trademark energetic and involving camera-work. The main draw is the antics of the characters and their relationships rather than a high-stakes narrative. Dramatic things happen but don&apos;t relate intrinsically to the central plot: that of De Niro&apos;s character Johnny Boy, his debts to clubs, bars and old pals along with his long-suffering buddy Charlie (Keitel).

In comparison to other Scorsese films (which is inevitably going to happen if this is not your first Scorsese), it is very low on scale and as mentioned before, low on stakes. This is no gangster epic or psychological portrait but simply a 2 hour window into the streets of New York. It is certainly worth watching.",7,"['Crime', 'Drama', 'Thriller']","['italian american', 'epilepsy', 'gangster', 'bar', 'close up of breasts']",1973-10-14,['Martin Scorsese'],"['Robert De Niro', 'Harvey Keitel', 'David Proval']","['Martin Scorsese', 'Mardik Martin']"

The team: Graham Chapman, Terry Gilliam, John Cleese, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, Michael Palin and others do a good job of acting, writing and directing. Yes, it might not be everyone&apos;s cup of tea but those familiar with the Monty Python series know what kind of humour to expect.

And don&apos;t get me wrong, cause I&apos;m not a Statham&apos;s fan. I didn&apos;t like &apos;The transporter&apos; cause the acting (especially the bad guy) was way too unreal.

The action scenes are really sublime and they don&apos;t stop until the last minute. Actors also fit in an interesting story.

Memento,A man with short-term memory loss attempts to track down his wife&apos;s murderer.,"Thank Goodness I didn&apos;t read the reviews posted before I saw the film!! Most reviews (including ones on this site) will tell you waaayyyy too much about the movie, and that&apos;s just plain frustrating. But, as an avid cinephile, I promise not to do the same.

Memento is one of those pictures that will have you sitting in the theater after the lights come up so you can talk to everyone else about what they thought of the movie. This is a highly intelligent and original brain teaser that will have you guessing from beginning to end, and even afterwards. The story and the direction are the best I&apos;ve seen so far this year, and it deserves all the kudos it gets.

Plainly put, the film tells the story of Leonard Shelby: a man who lost his short term memory in an assault where his wife was raped and murdered; now he&apos;s looking for the killer, despite his handicap. Simple as that. You don&apos;t need to know anymore.

The film is constructed and told in such a way that you are constantly put into the shoes of Leonard Shelby, beautifully played by Guy Pierce. Carrie-Ann Moss gives an equally mysterious and complex performance. This film is well-made all the way around--from the direction, to the editing, and especially the unique story that is rarely found in Hollywood these days. Four Stars!

This review may have been a little dry on the details, but go see the movie--you&apos;ll be thanking me later.

Meteor,The U.S. must join forces with the U.S.S.R. in order to destroy a gigantic asteroid heading straight for Earth.,"Meteor and When Time Ran Out marked the end of the decade of the disaster epic. I guess that Hollywood was just running out of ideas and that the formula of getting a bunch of big name players and put them in harm&apos;s way was wearing thin.

You can see that just about everybody here is bored, they all say the lines without any real conviction. Except for Martin Landau. As an Air Force General and Cold Warrior of the first order, he&apos;s extremely upset that the USA and the USSR have buried their differences to work on a real immediate problem. He resents Russians Brian Keith and Natalie Wood in the war room and Landau overacts outrageously.

A comet hurtling through the asteroid belt hit one of the big asteroids and sent one big chunk of rock and a whole bunch smaller ones as space calling cards speeding to Earth. That big guy if it hits spells the end of life on the planet. 

Some criticism has been made that the special effects were a bit cheesy. By today&apos;s standards of course they were. So are some of those of the great Cecil B. DeMille. That&apos;s progress for you.

I&apos;m not sure but this may have been the first time that Natalie Wood played someone of her own ancestry on film. Too bad she and Sean Connery as the NASA scientist didn&apos;t get to do something better before she passed away.

All the stars got a good pay day out of this though Sean Connery said there were some real scary moments with the cast trying to escape through the subway system with all the mud. A few times some people came close to really being buried in it for art&apos;s sake.

Microwave Massacre,"Fed up of his wife&apos;s bad cooking, Donald kills her and turns to cannibalism to satisfy his appetite.","Far from being the worst horror film of all time, and really not much of a horror movie at all but more of a black comedy for lack of a better description. Jackie Vernon plays Donald whose wife refuses to give him solid, working-man food but rather inundates his lunch box with crab sandwiches and other gourmet meals. Donald gets so upset after a night of drinking his woes that he slays his wife and then packs her in the freezer, later goes for a bite to eat, and unwittingly eats her hand wrapped in tin foil. From there he realizes he loves the taste and begins to eat women all the time(yes, that pun and every possible one under the sun was used in the film!). Thereis an endless parade of one-liners, many just wretched, but after a bit I was finding some of them amusing as this film is trying to be nothing more than a sophomoric horror spoof. It has a seventies feel to it though it was made in 1983. The scary moments are non-existent. What do we get: roly-poly Jackie Vernon quipping wisecracks as he searches for dinner and a date all in one. Vernon is just, well, there. He quite honestly doesn&apos;t have much of a movie presence, but he can deliver his lines - if you can be more unlike me and get past the voice of Frosty the Snowman swearing and having his way with a prostitute and even stuffing a turkey. The gal that plays his wife is amusing if nothing else, and the rest of the cast could be extras on Lost for all we know/care. There are a few exceptions because the film has liberal doses of gratuitous nudity - no more eye-popping then the opening with the knothole girl. A real looker and possibly the high point of this film. More is the pity. that being said; however, Microwave Massacre is watchable - even again in the next decade possibly. seeing Vernon act is intriguing as we have little of him in film(I wonder why?). You could definitely do a lot worse than this. I have seen horror films that made my eyes glaze over from boredom and wished/willed my fingers to pass the fast forward.

Midnight Cowboy,"A naive hustler travels from Texas to New York City to seek personal fortune, finding a new friend in the process.","I saw MIDNIGHT COWBOY in easter 1970 when i was 15. It was at a very quiet matinée in a very cold rural mountain holiday resort town in in Australia. I was alone as I had gone for a walk but discovered I was in time for the matinée. It was one of the great cinema experiences of my teenage life and left an impression on me that still resonates. After the screening, it was freezing and foggy outside and almost dark. I walked to a nearby park in the freezing fog, sat on a wet bench and cried and cried until the tears began to freeze too. I wiped them away and went home for dinner. Nobody the wiser except me. Recently I was the film again for the first time in 40 years. I am simply awestruck at the sense of NY 1969 that floods from the screen, the sense of the time anywhere in 1969 and the fact that the film is shattering in it&apos;s depiction of poverty and friendship in a bleak city. Recently I also went to NY and found that as fascinating for I felt NY was completely safe and totally unlike the squalor seen in their lives in the film. NY today is very pretty and epic and like a fun park. I have enduring respect and admiration for this extraordinary film. I hope you do too. The performances by Voight and Hoffman are award worthy, and Joe Buck, like Forrest Gump is the sexy flip side of the American Everyman. Directed by a Brit: John Schlesinger whose International eye for NY and the tawdry but fascinating life of USA 1969 has allowed this film to be as great as it is, only made one other great American films and that is the equally tangible and shocking Hollywood pit of 1937 called DAY OF THE LOCUST.

Xing xing wang,,"It&apos;s very fast-paced and very silly, which makes for a somewhat entertaining monster movie that&apos;s never quite as engaging or as charming as many of the old Godzilla movies it&apos;s clearly inspired by. I&apos;d say it&apos;s not even as good as the 1976 version of King Kong (starring Jeff Bridges) that it was probably trying to capitalise off of.

Still, the schlocky set pieces are somewhat fun, and at 90 minutes with lots of action/special effects, you can&apos;t call it dull. And as the King Kong movies have shown, it&apos;s easier to have a monkey monster as a victim than a lizard monster as a victim (for the most part), and there are parts that do sort of make you feel bad for this big, slightly crazed looking giant monkey.

Mildred Pierce,A hard-working mother inches towards disaster as she divorces her husband and starts a successful restaurant business to support her spoiled daughter.,"The story that unfolds in Mildred Pierce is complicated and dark, and at its darkest, is a chilling portrait of a mother so devoted to her children (well, child, really) that she would go to any and all lengths for them. Although some of the situations and scenes suffer from the passage of time (the modern audience in the cinema, myself included, couldn&apos;t help laughing at some of the more ludicrous things said/done), the film as a whole worked, mostly on the strength of the performances.

Joan Crawford won her only Oscar for her role, and it was well-deserved--she held the film together with a confident performance that ranged from charming and sassy, to desperate and almost frightening. The final scenes of the film, especially, captured Mildred at her most pathetic, and Crawford looked utterly despondent in the telephone scene. Ann Blyth is utterly convincing as the spoilt, deeply disturbed Veda, narcissistic and unrelentingly manipulative of her mother. And the best supporting performance had to come from Eve Arden, who played Mildred&apos;s friend Ida--Arden saunters across the screen, stealing scenes left and right, before disappearing from view again. She was excellent!

The film is well worth the watch--not brilliant, but definitely very good. I also like the story-telling technique and the direction (the director made quite clever and frequent use of shadows and mirrors), and it&apos;s good that the darkness and melodrama was frequently mitigated by the well-written dialogue. 8/10.",8,"['Crime', 'Drama', 'Film-Noir']","['in medias res', 'restaurant', 'ungrateful daughter', 'dysfunctional marriage', 'ex husband ex wife relationship']",1945-10-20,['Michael Curtiz'],"['Joan Crawford', 'Jack Carson', 'Zachary Scott']","['Ranald MacDougall', 'James M.

Minority Report,"In a future where a special police unit is able to arrest murderers before they commit their crimes, an officer from that unit is himself accused of a future murder.","Before they joined forces to give sci-fi fans their hugely disappointing version of War Of The Worlds, Spielberg and Cruise worked together on Minority Report, a near-future tale based on a short story by Philip K. Dick in which violent crimes can be predicted and prevented from occurring, the perpetrator intercepted before they can carry out the deed. Star Cruise plays pre-crime cop John Anderton, who finds himself on the run after it is predicted that he himself will commit a murder.

The good news is that Minority Report is a lot more enjoyable than the duo&apos;s H.G.Wells debacle, with an engrossing murder mystery plot, lots of great visuals, excellent production design, and some well executed and extremely fun action set-pieces, all of which help detract from the story&apos;s inevitable paradoxical issues and Spielberg&apos;s occasional, frustratingly unrestrained direction (Cruise leaping from car roof to car roof on a towering vertical road stretches plausibility a bit too far, but at least it&apos;s not &apos;nuke the fridge&apos; bad).

When his sanity is questioned, a lawyer defends him in court by arguing that he&apos;s not mis...","Miracle On 34Th Street was a great Christmas movie. The major conflict of the movie was whether or not Santa Claus really existed. 

 The movie begins with Kris Cringle (Edmund Gwen) walking by a store with a man setting up a display of reindeer and notices that they are not in order. Kris tells the man politely how to fix them in the right positions, but the man gives him a strange look and goes back to work. Kris Cringle believes himself to be Santa Claus although most everyone else thinks he is crazy. Even little Susan (Natalie Wood) thinks he is a fake and doesn&apos;t believe in any fairytales&apos;. Her mother, Doris Walker (Maureen O&apos;Hara), taught her that to believe in fairytales&apos; is childish and impractical. Kris is later made a part of the Macy&apos;s parade when the Santa Claus that was supposed to be in the parade is found drunk. When asked if he had ever had any experience, Kris replied, `Many times.&apos; Doris makes him the department store Santa Claus at Macy&apos;s where he tells many people that he is the real Santa Claus. 

As more people find out about Kris Cringle calling himself Santa Claus&apos;, they get upset saying that no such person really exists. Many people took it more literally and said that it would be impossible for reindeer to fly or for anyone to live in the North Pole. He is forced to take a mental examination and the doctor convinces Doris that Kris is mentally ill after he gets in a fight. Kris is arrested and taken to court and his lawyer is Mr. Gailey who starts to believe, along with Doris and Susan, the he actually is Santa Claus.

	I thought that this was a really good holiday movie that focus on something that all of us as little kids went through- believing or not believing in Santa Claus. It even feels like I should believe in Santa after watching it. I thought that Edmund Gwen was a really good actor and perfect for his part. He played his role very innocently, which made him very believable as Santa Claus. Natalie Wood was a great actress who played very well the typical role of the cynical child. The acting and the plot was very well written. It was a very innocent movie that is entertaining for all types of audiences.",,"['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Family']","['christmas movie', 'christmas', 'delusion', 'girl', 'courtroom']",1947-07-04,['George Seaton'],"['Edmund Gwenn', 'Maureen O&apos;Hara', 'John Payne']","['George Seaton', 'Valentine Davies']"
Mirrors,An ex-cop and his family are the target of an evil force that is using mirrors as a gateway into their home.,"A man and his family are terrorised by a supernatural force that is using mirrors as a way access their home. 

I welcome Kiefer Sutherland with open arms as he&apos;s in the land of TV far too often. Although he seems to lack the great range of his father Donald, he is a great underrated actor. Mirrors gives Kiefer plenty to play with, but as with so many Asian horror remakes that have been spat-out recently and while Mirrors is one of the better re-workings, the story twist is something we&apos;ve seen too many times.

No stranger to remakes director Alexandre Aja (The Hills Have Eyes re-do and 2010&apos;s Piranha 3-D) takes the viewer though paint by numbers stuff as Ben Carson (Kiefer), a former undercover detective, is forced to take a night time security job at a department store that was gutted by a fire. However, there is an evil lurking in the mirrors, an entity he must stop to save his family.

Lately, I wish all the PC&apos;s in the world were stolen so I wouldn&apos;t have to see another dodgy effect detract from an actor&apos;s performance. While some effects are modest it&apos;s the bad CGI that spoils some moments of scariness. When practical effects are used there&apos;s one moment that would stop you ever looking into a mirror and taking a bath again.

Jason Flemyng shows up for a brief moment but seems to take his pay cheque and disappear as fast as some of the eerie atmosphere. Between Paula Patton and Amy Smarts (almost a cameo appearance) the acting is above average right down to the child actors who are at no time annoying.

Overall, Kiefer leaves his mark and it may not be the most original horror but at times it is certainly is creepy, not since Poltergeist and Poltergeist 3 have mirrors been so chilling.",,"['Horror', 'Mystery']","['mirror', 'psychiatric hospital', 'female rear nudity', 'supernatural horror', 'remake']",2008-08-15,['Alexandre Aja'],"['Kiefer Sutherland', 'Paula Patton', 'Amy Smart']","['Alexandre Aja', 'Grégory Levasseur', 'Sung-ho Kim']"

Missing in Action,Colonel Braddock launches a mission deep into the jungles of Vietnam to find the POW camp that he escaped from and free the Americans still held captive there.,"Angered by a Vietnamese General&apos;s claims that there are no prisoners-of-war in his country, an American soldier goes on a rogue mission to rescue the missing-in-action US troops that he suspects are still held in Vietnam in this Chuck Norris action thriller. The film benefits from a rousing music score by Jay Chattaway and a delightful supporting turn from a moody M. Emmet Walsh who accompanies Norris on his mission. There are solid action sequences too, though much of it is shooting and explosions rather than hand-to-hand combat, and they are surprisingly few and far between with most of the excitement saved until the end. The plot is also a tad half-baked. James Hong is perfectly charismatic as the Vietnamese General, but his motives for lying to the US about the POWs are never made clear. By lying about their existence, the Vietnamese are not able to use the MIA soldiers for bargaining purposes, and if they are lying to cover up the fact that they took so many Americans prisoners, it would make more sense to execute them rather than keep them alive in camps. Even if the finer details do not quite add up though, Norris is saddled with an interesting enough character to keep things plodding along, and the film suffices quite well as a story of a man reluctantly returning to Vietnam to settle unfinished business that he would really rather forget.",6,"['Action', 'Adventure', 'Drama']","['jungle', 'jungle adventure', 'vietnam war', 'one man army', 'vietnam']",1984-11-16,['Joseph Zito'],"['Chuck Norris', 'M.

The Mist,"A freak storm unleashes a species of bloodthirsty creatures on a small town, where a small band of citizens hole up in a supermarket and fight for their lives.","If, two years ago, you told me that within a couple of years two excellent Stephen King film adaptations would be released, I would probably have laughed it off. Films like The Shining, Shawshank Redemption, Stand by Me, The Stand and 1408 are usually pretty far between (Note that I consider The Green Mile and Carrie to be the most over-rated King adaptations, so they do not appear here). I like most of the films that have been made from Stephen King novels, novellas, and short stories mainly because I like Stephen King, but I do not recommend many of them as truly good films.

Frank Darabont&apos;s (writing and directing) The Mist adapts a horror novella of the same name. King&apos;s horror work has been the most difficult material to adapt, but this film is comparable to other genre stand-outs such as The Shining and 1408.

A brief, dramatic thunderstorm is followed by a freak mist that descends on a small New England town. As the mist permeates the town, people congregate in the local supermarket and hardware store to stock up and gather supplies. David Drayton (Thomas Jane), his son (Nathan Gamble), and his neighbor (Andre Braugher) are among them. Tension builds as a steady stream of military vehicles pass through the mist headed south from a nearby base. But serious concern doesn&apos;t start until one of the locals runs to the supermarket with blood spatters on his clothing and talking of monsters in the mist.

Indeed, there are horrors outside in the fog, but there are also horrors inside the market - as paranoia, irrationality and religion come into conflict with practical issues of survival.

Unlike many horror films, The Mist examines fear and its effects realistically, looks at the horror created by forces beyond human control and the even more terrifying horror that fear creates through forces that are completely within our grasp - our own fears, our beliefs and our treatment of each other. It does so using a classic formula which is comparable to films like Night of the Living Dead and, more recently, Feast.

The cinematography, editing and directing are all excellent. The acting is quite good - Marcia Gay Harden and William Sadler stood out for me - and the script is exactly where it needed to be for this adaptation.

Highly recommended for King fans and horror fans. Recommended for Sci-Fi fans.

Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,"A naive youth leader is appointed to fill a vacancy in the U.S. Senate. His idealistic plans promptly collide with corruption at home and subterfuge from his hero in Washington, but he tries to forge ahead despite attacks on his c...","Frank Capra&apos;s knack for getting the best out of JAMES STEWART and JEAN ARTHUR is demonstrated here with both stars giving superb performances. Ironically, Stewart would not win the Oscar for this role but was awarded one the following year for a lesser role in THE PHILADELPHIA STORY.

 As a bumbling, naive senator who is a lamb thrown to the wolves in Washington, D.C., Stewart does a fabulous job--although there are moments when his bumbling awkwardness looks a bit staged. Jean Arthur is a natural for the role of the wise secretary who at first scorns his innocent ways but soon comes to realize he&apos;s the real thing.

All of the supporting players are excellent--especially CLAUDE RAINS as a mentor to Stewart who finally has a conscience about deceiving him, and Harry Carey (the western actor) as the man with the gavel who soon realizes that Stewart is not to be underestimated. His reaction shots, grinning and sometimes stifling a grin, say more than words. He and Rains both deserved their supporting role nominations.

But, as usual in a Capra film, you have to be willing to forgive some obvious plot contrivances or overall schmaltz. The ending (when it finally comes after some excessive length in running time) is rather abrupt as though the director suddenly realized he&apos;d gone overtime on the story. And some of the sentimentality (such as the scene where Arthur joins him at the Lincoln Memorial where she knew she&apos;d find him), is hard to swallow until you remind yourself that--hey, this is Capra-corn. 

Nevertheless, despite some flaws, it&apos;s the kind of comedy-drama about Washington, D.C. that only a director like Capra could make. And the replica of the Senate is amazingly detailed, as are all the interiors which were shot on a soundstage at Columbia.

Moby Dick,"The sole survivor of a lost whaling ship relates the tale of his captain&apos;s self-destructive obsession to hunt the white whale, Moby Dick.","Gregory Peck gives a riveting portrayal of Captain Ahab, a man obsessed with hunting down the white whale, Moby Dick, who disfigured him years earlier. I haven&apos;t read the Herman Melville novel on which this film is based so I can&apos;t comment on it as as adaptation. Standing alone as a

film however, it was very entertaining. Peck draws the viewer in and makes him believe in (and fear) his obsession. The audience instantly becomes familiar with the hard life and the hopes of Ahab and his men

as they engage in the ageless confrontation between man and nature. The special effects are suprisingly good for the era in which they were created.

"Monsters, Inc.","In order to power the city, monsters have to scare children so that they scream. However, the children are toxic to the monsters, and after a child gets through, two monsters realize things may not be what they think.","You may admire the hair detail on Sully the Yeti&apos;s arm, but you will be amazed at the warmth of characterization in `Monsters, Inc.,&apos; surpassing even the great `Shrek&apos; earlier this year. Goodman and Crystal are a comedic team reminiscent of the zaniest Martin and Lewis days. Crystal&apos;s Borscht-belt routines brought smiles even to this jaded and admittedly tough-on-comedy critic. I thought Eddie Murphy&apos;s donkey in `Shrek&apos; was smart and funny; Crystal&apos;s one-eyed monster is even better with its wry and annoying wit.

Cleaning the environment of child contamination is a hilarious conceit that turns around the usual fears children have of monsters in closets. It is also a chilling parallel to the challenge of removing anthrax from today&apos;s letters. Generally, the allegorical underpinnings of animation are natural for the medium, powerful like the images of the novel `Animal Farm&apos; for political and sociological levels of meaning. For example, the endless-door motif in this film is an ingenious metaphor for the scary and glorious possibilities the present and future hold for kids.

Even before you see this feature, Pixar offers the short feature `For the Birds&apos; -- a brilliant takeoff on Hitchcock&apos;s memorable film besides being a great commentary on diversity. The expressions around the animated eyes, as the little birds deal with the big bird interloper, are more expressive than those of most contemporary film actors, with the exception of Brando, Pacino, Depp, and Streep.

The short trailer for `Star Wars II: Attack of the Clones&apos; may precede the showing as it did ours for an added delight.

Moonrise Kingdom,"A pair of young lovers flee their New England town, which causes a local search party to fan out to find them.","Despite the dreadful title, Moonrise Kingdom is simply wonderful. 

Since his flying start with Bottle Rocket and the triumph of Rushmore, I felt that Wes Anderson had rather tottered off a true path. The Royal Tenenbaums was hit and miss, The Darjeeling Limited was too twee, and The Life Aquatic was simply AWFUL. I take against ANY film that wastes Bill Murray.

Moonrise Kingdom doesn&apos;t repeat that error. Despite covering ground Anderson&apos;s already visited to an extent in Rushmore, MK looks at a teenage crush with fresh eyes, and surrounds it with a fantastic cast of oddballs and misfits. Unlike his films where the characters are irritatingly quirky for the sake of it, these oddballs seem organic to their strange island home. Star among them is Ed Norton as Scout Master Ward, who looks as if he&apos;s having the time of his life in shorts and woggles, in charge of a troop described as &apos;beige lunatics&apos;.

Bruce Willis, Frances McDormand and Bill Murray all play their parts but never feel as though they&apos;re elbowing for the spotlight, which keeps the mood kind, befitting the hearts of all involved in the search for runaway scout, Sam, and his pen-pal, Suzy. 

Visually, it&apos;s a feast of saturated colour and fabulous design, but - as with the best of Wes Anderson - the devil&apos;s always in the detail. The laughs come from minutely observed accessories (keep an eye on the scouts&apos; badges!) and from throwaway truths. And the soundtrack is a great mix of wistful Western and classical pieces. Definitely buyable. 

Anderson flirts with surrealism, but never gets Burtonesque, controlling his story with a firmer hand and to better effect. His situations might be bizarre, but the people in them are always painfully, wonderfully human. It&apos;s also a rare film - one you could watch with your grandmother or your grandchildren, with only a couple of moments where young eyes would have to be covered, and no real violence or swearing.

There is an overwhelming feeling of innocence and good will throughout.

I loved it from the opening frames, and it only got better from there.",10,"['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Family']","['young love', '1960s', 'boy scouts camp', 'coming of age', 'storm']",2012-06-29,['Wes Anderson'],"['Jared Gilman', 'Kara Hayward', 'Bruce Willis']","['Wes Anderson', 'Roman Coppola']"
Donde caben dos,A diverse group of people share a night of sexual self-discovery.,"I&apos;m always game for a sex positive story but I&apos;m equally wary about how obnoxious they can be.

As our stories interweave throughout this club (I need one near me, seriously) they paint a picture about how our sexuality isn&apos;t really good or bad; you just need to have an emotional honesty with yourself and all other relevant individuals.

By turns, intriguing, sophomoric, bawdy and thoughtful, the one storyline not involved with the club is very disharmonious and is soured by a sort of smugness as well intentioned people seem to suffer.

The storyline of the cousin was so almost handled impeccably but they had to blow the subtlety.

To be honest I mostly watched to see if it would be the soft-core erotica I hoped it would be and asides from one fine pair of mini-lolas approaching the bar, it isn&apos;t.",6,['Comedy'],"['swingers club', 'sexual desire', 'sexual fantasy', 'uptight man', 'marriage']",2021-11-30,['Paco Caballero'],"['Ernesto Alterio', 'María Morales', 'Luis Callejo']","['Paco Caballero', 'Daniel González', 'Eric Navarro']"

Morvern Callar,"After her beloved boyfriend&apos;s suicide, a mourning supermarket worker and her best friend hit the road in Scotland, but find that grief is something that you can&apos;t run away from forever.","Ramsey&apos;s second film after the totally impressive Ratcatcher has an air of aimlessness about it. I haven&apos;t read the book but the film has only one idea: how does a girl behave when she finds her boyfriend dead with slashed wrists on the floor of their flat? Callar&apos;s response is almost post-contemporary - what happens here could simply never have been conceived of more than a few years ago. We follow Samantha Morton (as Callar) through subsequent hazy meanderings with her girlfriend. We assume she is in severe temporary shock at the tragedy - so the creeping suspicion that she is simply a half-wit is disappointing, though all the soft drugs confounds the issue. Life seems impoverished here, as if the city has sucked something out of people. Even death is meaningless.

The early part of the film looks dangerously like Catherine Breillat territory - the last thing we need is an original talent like Ramsey to start ripping people off - and I think she was only partly able to haul herself out of the Breillat groove. The tension lapses completely during the second half when Callar goes on holiday in Spain, and there is a silly scene when she meets publishers and passes herself off as the writer of her dead boyfriend&apos;s novel that we could have done without.

On the whole, very nicely executed though; a fine performance by Morton, a great and atmospheric opening, and some cool music including Aphex Twin make it worth watching.

I love the fact that this is a gangster except Abel is desperately trying not to be a gangster. Also fuel oil delivery is not the usual backdrop but it works. Oscar Isaac does an amazing job.

Mother&apos;s Day,,"Garry Marshall died this year after a very long career of feel goo films he wrote, directed, acted in, produced – and sometimes all simultaneously, both on television (The Odd Couple, Mork and Mindy, Happy Days, Laverne & Shirley) and in movies (Beaches, Pretty Woman, Runaway Bride, The Other Sister, The Princess Diaries, Valentine&apos;s Day, New year&apos;s Eve, etc). He often worked with the same actors – a trusted bond of friendship. While MOTHER&apos;S DAY my not be one of his best films, it completes his trilogy of holiday films and brings the usual warmth and keen observation of interpersonal relationships to play from a richly popular cast of fine actors.

Three generations come together in the week leading up to Mother&apos;s Day. Sandy (Jennifer Anniston), a divorcée who has two sons who tries to co-parent with her ex (Timothy Olyphant). But when her ex remarries a girl half her age (Shay Mitchell), she freaks out because she&apos;s spending time with her sons and doing things with them that she usually does. Her friend, Jesse (Kate Hudson) is surprised by her parents (Margo Martindale and Robert Pine) who show up unannounced and they discover who Jesse&apos;s Indian husband (Aasif Mandvi) is and he learns that she didn&apos;t tell them about him which prompts him to leave, And they also learn whom their other daughter Gabi (Sarah Chalke) Is married to Max (Cameron Esposito) in a lesbian marriage. Kristin (Britt Robertson) is a girl who has a boyfriend Zach (Jack Whitehall) and a child but her boyfriend wants them to go to the next level, marriage but she has unresolved issues which keeps her from taking the plunge and her boyfriend is uncertain how long he can wait. Things change a bit when Kristin discovers who her birth mother is. Bradley (Jason Sudeikis) is a widower with two daughters, one of whom is a teenager and Bradley finds it hard to accept her new interests like boys and he still misses his wife. It all comes together at Mother&apos;s Day – time heals all things.

Mother&apos;s Red Dress,A Twilight Zone-type story about a young man who falls in love and is ready to start college. His problems begin when he cannot tell if his memories are real or imagined.,"I was highly impressed with the quality of the this film. It has the look of mainstream work and I am sure that was no easy task without a mainstream budget. The story is touching, shocking, and dark at times. The acting and directing compliment the writing perfectly. I felt like I had been to that coffee shop and could be friends with any of them. Since it is an Independent film, I think there was more freedom to examine the darker sides that a mainstream film might skim or pretty up a bit to be appealing to more general audiences. Because of that freedom, you end up with a film that is much more real, much easier to identify with, and something that draws you in like a great novel. -- Teeco71",,"['Drama', 'Romance', 'Thriller']","['boyfriend', 'love', 'loyalty', 'domestic abuse', 'violence']",2011-09-18,['Edgar Michael Bravo'],"['Timothy Driscoll', 'Alexandra Swarens', 'Alisha Seaton']",['Edgar Michael Bravo']

The Mummy&apos;s Curse,"Shipped to Louisiana, the mummy Kharis from Egypt roams the bayou, tormented by his forbidden love for Princess Ananka.","From &apos;The Mummy&apos;s Hand (1940) through &apos;The Mummy&apos;s Curse (1944)&apos; some interesting things but none more bizarre than the fact Kharis and Ananka sank into the Massachusetts swamps in the &apos;The Mummy&apos;s Ghost (1944) but end up rising in the Louisiana swamps in &apos;The Mummy&apos;s Curse (1944)&apos;.

How did they end up in Louisiana? All we know is the townspeople and the sheriff&apos;s office (supposedly) chased Kharis and Ananka to Louisiana but the last film was set in Massachusetts... they chased them that far??? LOL The one major flaw with The Mummy&apos;s Curse but the film is fine otherwise.

If can go with or overlook the strange explanation given and can get into the idea of The Mummy ending up in Louisiana then you will find the film is is really just about as good of a B-Film as rest of the films in this series. Kharis can finally rest in peace.

The Mummy&apos;s Ghost,"Kharis the mummy is given a sacred potion that grants him eternal life to search for his lost love, Princess Ananka, despite the unending curse that haunts them.","This mummy film is one of a series of four produced by Universal Pictures in the 1940s--well after their original film starring Boris Karloff. While none of these films opened up a lot of new ground, they were good escapist fun--for kids and adults willing to suspend reality and have a good time. I personally LOVE these old Universal horror films--even the lesser ones like this film. This one&apos;s plot isn&apos;t so special (except once again the mummy somehow makes it to America), but it stands out due to the acting of George Zucco and John Carradine--two wonderful veteran horror actors who played up the campiness of the film and made it far more entertaining.

The film looks a lot less impressive than the newest mummy films from Hollywood, but they still managed to be fun. Plus, the newer films, in my opinion, lack fun because they are so special effects-driven.

Murders in the Rue Morgue,"A mad scientist seeks to mingle human blood with that of an ape, and resorts to kidnapping women for his experiments.","Murders In The Rue Morgue casts Bela Lugosi as one of the many mad scientists he played in his long career. To make ends meet he has a carnival act, but it&apos;s really a blind for some gruesome experiments involving sex. InterSpecies sex that is.

If Charles Darwin is correct and man is related to the other primates than it follows, reasons Bela apes should be looking to mate with man given the proper stimulation. So for his horny gorilla he kidnaps women and injects them with simian blood. In the Paris of 1845 Bela&apos;s experiments are working pretty good as his ape is let loose on these injected women and the young women of Paris are in danger. Women of all classes as streetwalker Arlene Francis discovers to her tragic regret.

King Kong never eyed Fay Wray with more lust than Bela&apos;s simian had when he was checking out Sidney Fox. In fact King Kong should prove the hypothesis Lugosi was advancing. The climax of Murders At The Rue Morgue is very similar to King Kong with Leon Ames playing the Bruce Cabot part.

Some really great sets and beautiful cinematography are the main attraction of Murders At The Rue Morgue which bares only the slightest resemblance to Edgar Allan Poe&apos;s story. Lugosi is fabulously sinister and lustful, he&apos;s checking out Fox and the others himself.

Watching the Iguchi movies, I always feel that the producers and directors are having fun while making the movies. This fun translates into the scenes and movies. This movies is not an exception, some of the comedic elements are hilarious - The Astro Boy scene is a laugh!!.

The action in the movie is quite well done as well. The rampage by Rin in part 1 is very well done. The director knows how to frame the shots to actually make it look like fights.

The acting by the 3 leads is solid, these girls shows an earnestness and professionalism in their roles, no bad B movie acting here. The bad guys are caricatures, the main baddie reminds me of the lead singer from Dead or Alive one of those 80s androgynous pop bands.

The Mutilator,"A college student, who accidentally killed his mother as a child, decides to take his friends to his father&apos;s fishing cabin during fall break, not knowing that his crazed father is stalking the place.","The Mutilator (1984) 

** 1/2 (out of 4) 

A young boy named Ed is cleaning his father&apos;s gun for his birthday but while cleaning it the thing goes off killing his mother. From this point on the father has nothing to do with Ed. Flash forward several years and Ed is in college when he gets a call from his father out of nowhere. The father asks for Ed to return to a beach front property and close it down for the winter. Ed takes along his girlfriend and four other friends but soon they start to get violently murdered.

THE MUTILATOR has a pretty big following among people who enjoy the slasher boom that happened from 1980-84. I&apos;m a major slasher fan but for the most part there were a lot of movies that were made to try and get some of the box office dollars. More times than not these films were poorly made, poorly shot and featured very little gore. They were just cheap C movies that were thrown into theaters for a quick buck. THE MUTILATOR isn&apos;t one of those movies as it&apos;s fairly well-made, features a nice cast and best of all is that it actually delivers on the gore.

One thing that did surprise me about this film is that it really doesn&apos;t try to play up a mystery aspect. We&apos;re pretty much told from the start what to expect and we see who the killer is pretty early on. The screenplay spends way too much time with the characters as the murders are spread out quite a bit and there are some logical issues but I guess this here is to be expected. I think the film really benefits from the six main characters being likable and you at least don&apos;t mind hanging out with them while you wait for them to be slaughtered.

Of course, when it comes to a slasher the most important thing is the actual kills and THE MUTILATOR is a major success here. In fact, I&apos;m really surprised that these effects got past the MPAA because they are rather graphic and gory. This includes a decapitation but the highlight of the film involves a hook. I&apos;ll just leave it at that but it&apos;s certainly very cringe-worthy and contains a great amount of blood. THE MUTILATOR certainly isn&apos;t a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination but it&apos;s a good slasher.",,"['Horror', 'Thriller']","['sadistic murderer', 'walking on a beach', 'teenager', 'car won&apos;t start', 'skinny dipping']",1984-10-05,"['Buddy Cooper', 'John Douglass']","['Matt Mitler', 'Ruth Martinez', 'Bill Hitchcock']",['Buddy Cooper']

While it is actually true that the humour here isn&apos;t too original, the execution is so irresistibly sure all can be forgiven. Even certain emotional, life lesson -like moments didn&apos;t bother me, for they have been done with utmost class.

The film flows flawlessly through its duration, and hardly anything seems out of place; there&apos;s no forced (I stress that word) emotionality to be found. Those things alone are something you don&apos;t often get. It has a splendid look to it, with the bright colours and the design, the costumes contributing to the wonderfully old-fashioned and fresh feel it has (how convenient).

The script is full of almost-priceless moments and witty one-liners and otherwise hilarious dialogue. I would imagine the film is of high re-watch value. It is by no means without its share of problems, though. As said, there&apos;s little that&apos;s not been done elsewhere, but the finished film works so well as a whole I can but say that all the praise is deserved.

My Little Eye,"Five people are offered one million dollars to spend six months together in an isolated mansion, with cameras watching their every move.","What a great idea: shooting a film using only web cams. I usually like to watch movies that aren&apos;t mainstream, and the concept of My Little Eye sure stands out.

The plot isn&apos;t that complicated; it focuses on five people trying to live in an old house in the middle of a forest. If they manage to stay there for six months without contacting the outside world, each of them wins 1.000.000$. If someone breaks the rules, everyone loses their million. The movie takes place in the final week of the competition, and suddenly, weird things start to happen. It seems that the contestants&apos; pasts have come back haunting them. But as it usually is, some things aren&apos;t what they seem to be...

The cast of My Little Eye is great, since all of the few actors/actresses are pretty much &apos;non-famous&apos; (for me at least), helping to create an illusion of an Big Brother-type of game, where ordinary people do stuff for money.

There is this certain tension throughout the movie, creating a disturbing feeling that &apos;something isn&apos;t right&apos;. However, in my opinion this movie wasn&apos;t scary. I&apos;d rather call this movie a thriller-, than a horror-movie.

Don&apos;t get me wrong, but the movie disappointed me a little. Everything in this movie was a bit pale. I admit, that the night-vision scenes were cool, but at the end of the movie you&apos;ve definitely had enough of web cams.

Il mio viaggio in Italia,World-renowned director Martin Scorsese narrates this journey through his favorites in Italian cinema.,"How does a filmmaker get out of being asked in every interview what films influence him? He makes a movie about them. Martin Scorsese&apos;s lengthy documentary, My Voyage to Italy has been making the rounds on film festival circuit since 1999. It is now available to the general public on two-disc DVD.

Scorsese says in the beginning of My Voyage to Italy that his film was made so that people, especially today&apos;s youth, can realize that not all great films are born deep in the heart of Hollywood, USA. Scorsese directs and narrates this documentary about the history of Italian cinema. My Voyage to Italy includes home video from Scorsese&apos;s childhood and footage from 24 movies made between 1914 and 1966. It is these films that inspired him to become one of America&apos;s most well known and beloved directors. Scorsese gives us plot points, character descriptions and even endings of each classic film, pointing out specific elements that make the movie great. He tells us the strengths and weaknesses of each film and what he got out of it. At one point, he even shows us the same scene twice so we can spot exactly what he wants us to see. And, although you know the ending of these films, you are somehow still compelled to go out and see them anyway. It is as if he is a close friend who is describing a movie he just saw and tells you to go see it. This is a person whose opinion you can have confidence in.

The films featured in My Voyage to Italy opened the door for today&apos;s writers and directors. In a time where free speech was only something the press could take advantage of, many of the films were considered scandalous and provoked boycotts and law suits in the US. Roberto Rossellini&apos;s film Il Miracolo (The Miracle) prompted a US court to rule that filmmakers are entitled to the same freedom of speech as the media. Where would modern cinema be without this landmark decision?

Scorsese&apos;s main influences were the films made during the Italian neo-realism movement. All of the films in the genre focused on the reality of World War II; the horrors and sacrifice, liberation and compassion; all of the emotions felt during that time are on the screen, giving the audience little-to-no optimism or silver-lining. Through these films, the viewer experiences the filmmaker&apos;s response to that moment in history. They were not about a hero or a villain, but about life during and after the most extensive and costly war in the history of the world. Through these movies, Scorsese was subjected to the true Italian life and culture he couldn&apos;t experience at home in New York.

My Voyage to Italy should be required viewing for people who want to pursue a career in film; it is like a four-hour advanced film class that is as interesting as it is entertaining. It is obvious to the viewer that the films Scorsese highlights are dear to his heart. Based on the films that he loves, you can clearly see their influence reflected in the darker movies he has directed. Films like Taxi Driver and Goodfellas came to life because of the old movies he watched on the tiny black-and-white TV in his childhood home. 

Before watching My Voyage to Italy, I had never seen even a frame of a film by Rossellini or Federico Fellini. Now, I feel compelled to go out and study each one. That, I suppose, was Scorsese&apos;s intention all along.",,['Documentary'],"['film history', 'filmmaking', 'italian cinema', 'italy', 'cult director']",2002-05-16,['Martin Scorsese'],['Martin Scorsese'],"['Suso Cecchi D&apos;Amico', 'Raffaele Donato', 'Kent Jones']"
My Week with Marilyn,"Colin Clark, an employee of Sir Laurence Olivier, documents the tense interaction between Olivier and Marilyn Monroe during the production of The Prince and the Showgirl (1957).","I liked this movie, it was a non-judgemental re-telling of a slice of history. I thought the performances were all very good by the leading characters. I have no idea what the real Marilyn was like and I don&apos;t think many people do, but Michelle Williams character is a more than plausible interpretation, vulnerable at times, manipulative at others, who really knows where the reality lies, but there was something for everyone&apos;s interpretation. The movie did a good job of depicting that moment in time and transporting the audience there for a couple of hours. I guess it is every man&apos;s fantasy to have this opportunity, so the story is a satisfying one for any man who has ever wondered what the real Marilyn may have been like.",8,"['Biography', 'Drama']","['marilyn monroe character', 'laurence olivier character', 'vivien leigh character', 'jack cardiff character', 'arthur miller character']",2011-12-23,['Simon Curtis'],"['Michelle Williams', 'Eddie Redmayne', 'Kenneth Branagh']","['Adrian Hodges', 'Colin Clark']"
Mysterious Island,During the Civil War a group of Union soldiers and two Confederates escape the stockade using a hot-air balloon and end up on a strange Pacific island.,"This is a nice, satisfying telling of the Verne story, with special effects by Ray Harryhausen and a good score by Bernard Herrman. Escapees from a Civil War prison camp are blown way off course in a balloon they stole. They find themselves on an apparently deserted island somewhere in the Pacific, are joined by two women who were shipwrecked, and eventually come face-to-face with Captain Nemo and the wrecked Nautilus.

They have to deal with pirates, an erupting volcano and Harryhausen&apos;s creature threats. These include very large versions of a hungry red crab, an aggressive chicken (or dodo), a bee and an unhappy squid. Some of the creatures turn out to be very good boiled or roasted.

The movie holds up well because of a strong story, good action, and fairly well-defined characters. It features Herbert Lom, in my view an under-rated actor, and Joan Greenwood. By this time Greenwood was taking character parts and doing a lot of stage work. But from the mid-Forties to the mid-Fifties she was, I think, one of the sexiest, smartest actors Britain has ever produced.

The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!,Incompetent police Detective Frank Drebin must foil an attempt to assassinate Queen Elizabeth II.,"This likable silly farce with numberless comedy set pieces deals about the Agent Frank Drebin (Leslie Nielsen) , he is assigned by Mayor (Nancy Marchand) to protect the Queen of England and thwart the plans of a cunning baddie (Ricardo Montalban) . Frank along with captain Ed (George Kennedy) must investigate the attempt murder of his mate policeman (O.J.Simson) . Meanwhile , he falls in love with a gorgeous woman (Priscilla Presley) . 

This is a hilarious parody of the TV series :¨Police squad¨ with a similar premise to ¨Airplane¨ and ¨Top secret¨ . The spoof is surrealist , extreme and gross-out , but is also bold and intelligent with a myriad of imaginative sketches with no sense , slapdash and slapstick . The picture contains an unstopped string of gags each thirty seconds and silly jokes ; from start to finish the up-roaring comedy and humor result to be interminable , that&apos;s why the viewers will laugh uncontrollably . Habitual quirky and lunatic roles , especially reincarnated by Nielsen as a deadpan , idiot detective . Most of the laughs and sight gags galore work acceptably , particularly the jokes with the Queen&apos;s reception fiasco ; however, the overlong gags about the baseball are dull and boring . The picture is well screen-written and realized by Jim Abrahams and brothers Jerry , David Zucker (ZAZ) , parody pioneers and longtime collaborators with successful work making their own comedy troupe . Rated PG (parents guide) for some sexually , gags with occasional adult content and profanities . Followed by two inferior sequels with similar actors , elements and characters :¨The smell of fear¨ and ¨The final insult¨ . The film will appeal to absurd , unruly , wacky comedy fans . The movie is a Nielsen vehicle ,if you like his crazy , manic performance , you&apos;ll enjoy this one .",7,"['Comedy', 'Crime']","['parody', 'good versus evil', 'police investigation', 'scene before opening credits', 'musical scene']",1988-12-02,['David Zucker'],"['Leslie Nielsen', 'Priscilla Presley', 'O.J.

The Naked Spur,A bounty hunter trying to bring a murderer to justice is forced to accept the help of two less-than-trustworthy strangers.,"What I imagine makes THE NAKED SPUR stand out among other Westerns is its close, intimate focus on a small band of characters--for once, the motivations of the cynical bounty-hunter, the luckless gold prospector, the brash ne&apos;er-do-well, the slick outlaw are actually all explored and explained as best as psychology can allow. The focus isn&apos;t on the action, though there&apos;s plenty of that too; one really gets the idea that the action is peripheral to the character development, to the glimpses of history given by snatches of dialogue. James Stewart turns in a riveting performance as Howard Kemp, the embittered rancher turned bounty-hunter, who is seeking outlaw Ben Vandergroat (Robert Ryan) for the $5000 price on the latter&apos;s head. What Howard doesn&apos;t gamble on is the people added on to his journey along the way--the prospector Jesse Tate (Millard Mitchell), who&apos;s been running after gold all his life but has never managed to catch up to it; the reckless ex-soldier Roy Anderson (Ralph Meeker), discharged from the army for being &apos;morally unstable&apos;; and the young feisty Lina Patch (Janet Leigh), Ben&apos;s companion.

Throw this bunch of opposites in a trek back to Abilene, Kansas is a recipe for great drama: for example, the mini Indian massacre Roy brings about that gets Howard shot in the leg; the rock avalanche Ben starts to try to escape after sending Lina to distract Howard... even the even-tempered, apparently rational and loyal Jesse being so blinded by his life&apos;s pursuit that he frees Ben in return for gold and certainly winds up regretting it. Throughout the trek, one sees Ben&apos;s true duplicitous side, as he charmingly manipulates each and every other member of the group into distrusting one another. He knows Howard as well, from back in Abilene, and he is the one who lets us in on some of Howard&apos;s painful past. (Brilliantly illustrated by the fevered dreams Howard suffers from while still in shock from the bullet in his leg.)

The entire small cast is excellent. Ryan is slimily charming, Mitchell plays Jesse straight and honestly, Leigh brings off a rather thankless, almost characterless role well (her character is probably the least well developed in the film). It is James Stewart, however, who really deserves special mention for his portrayal of Howard Kemp... particularly since he&apos;d first thought that he was supposed to be playing the role of Ben Vandergroat, and had to be talked into taking the risk and playing Howard Kemp. One can certainly see why: Stewart&apos;s stock-in-trade is as the undeniably good hero, with whatever--if any!--psychological darkness (see George Bailey in It&apos;s A Wonderful Life) always lurking just beneath the surface but never enough to damage the character&apos;s positive standing in the audience&apos;s eyes. So of course, it&apos;s not easy to accept Stewart as the cynical, rude Howard at first--this probably is the least sympathetic character he has ever played, since the cracks in his tough, mean veneer come very seldom during the course of the film (and kudos to the writers for not having Stewart&apos;s innate goodness shine through more often and therefore use the audience&apos;s sympathies for the actor to bring some for the character).

 Howard is driven and relentless, as evidenced with the near psychosis he brings to his task of capturing Ben. From his sullenness when Ben reveals how much the capture really is worth, through to the final exciting sequence when Kemp pulls himself up the rock to face his nemesis (thereafter making it clear why the film is given the title of &apos;The Naked Spur&apos;), Howard Kemp is evidently a man who no longer trusts even *himself* to do the good thing. Quite a twist on the James Stewart persona, and certainly one he pulls off with great aplomb. His final scene with Janet Leigh, as Howard has to decide whether he can stand to lose his future to his past, definitely stands proud as some of Stewart&apos;s greatest work. 

I watched this film largely because of a great review I&apos;d read of it for Stewart&apos;s performance, and there is no denying that that is surely a good enough reason to watch this film. Stewart outdoes himself. Still, I got a lot more than I&apos;d bargained for, because this really is an excellent, psychologically-charged Western as well--the kind that makes you feel and think, and it&apos;s only the better films that make one do that.",8,"['Drama', 'Thriller', 'Western']","['woman shaves a man', 'bounty hunter', 'hand held over someone&apos;s mouth', 'coffee', 'hands tied']",1953-02-01,['Anthony Mann'],"['James Stewart', 'Janet Leigh', 'Robert Ryan']","['Sam Rolfe', 'Harold Jack Bloom']"

Kaze no tani no Naushika,Warrior and pacifist Princess Nausicaä desperately struggles to prevent two warring nations from destroying themselves and their dying planet.,"The film of all times. My personal favorite of all films, anime and non-anime. It has it all, a great, involving story that holds many important lessons of life. Interesting characters. Action, adventure, and above all feeling, the mood just sucks me in and holds on till the very end and beyond. The music is epic, and the animation is top class. The setting is a futuristic kind of midevil inspired fantasy... if that says anything... but anyway it feels very real although fantastic and apeals to me. This movie is from the very heart of Hayao Miyazaki, the master of anime... Its so sad that the dubbed version was so butchered, it was the first version I saw(actualy the swedish dubbing of the american dubbing(sigh)) and I thaught it was great, but now that I have seen the original, a new door has opened and revealed a true masterpiece.

Near Dark,A small-town farmer&apos;s son reluctantly joins a traveling group of vampires after he is bitten by a beautiful drifter.,"A real gem of a film which deserved a lot more credit than it ever received. Director Kathryn Bigelow went on to produce Aliens and direct Blue Steel and Point Blank, while writer Eric Red went on to direct the brilliant but rarely-glimpsed Coen and Tate, an equally dark movie. In this stylish tale of modern-day vampires, gothic horror is mixed with modern-day American society. The hero, Caleb, is plunged into a shadowy world of immortal vampires that exists just below the ordinary world as the bad guys imitate modern mortals to hunt their prey. With atmospheric music by German techno-band Tangerine Dream, an impressive and evocative horror film with the added attraction that it features my favourite actress, Jenny Wright!",,['Horror'],"['vampire', 'truck', 'bar', 'motel', 'cure for vampirism']",1988-01-08,['Kathryn Bigelow'],"['Adrian Pasdar', 'Jenny Wright', 'Lance Henriksen']","['Eric Red', 'Kathryn Bigelow']"

I guerrieri dell&apos;anno 2072,"In 2072 Rome, Italy, the ruthless CEO of a TV network plots to stage a modern series of gladiator games for ratings while one &apos;contenstant&apos; learns of a conspiracy behind the true nature of the results.","After knocking out a succession of gory cannibal flicks and umpteen cheap clones of Romero&apos;s Dawn of the Dead, several of Italy&apos;s horror directors moved on to the post-apocalyptic genre, bringing fans a tirade of silly Mad Max inspired nonsense with suitably daft titles: New Barbarians; Atlantis Interceptors; 2019: After the Fall of New York; New Bronx Gladiators of the Year 3000 (actually, that one&apos;s not real... but you get the idea).

Amongst these iffy, cheap looking and often laughable efforts was Lucio Fulci&apos;s Rome 2033 - The Fighter Centurions (as it was known here in the UK), a violent (natch!), cheesy, and amazingly shonky production, made slightly more interesting by the fact that it&apos;s plot bears more than a passing resemblance to the Arnold Schwarzeneggar hit The Running Manwhich was made three years later!

Jared Martin plays Drake, star of the bloodthirsty show Kill Bike, in which contestants on motorcycles must attempt to slaughter their opposition. However, when the corrupt bosses at TV network WBS decide that they need something even more brutal to help them win the ratings war, they frame Drake for murder and enrol him as a participant in their latest TV spectacular, Battle of the Damned, a fight to the death between condemned criminals in a gladiatorial arena.

There&apos;s also some boring nonsense about a super-computer planning to take over the world, and a beautiful WBS employee who attempts to help Drake avoid certain death, but, let&apos;s face it, that&apos;s probably not why most people will sit down to watch this. So what juicy delights does Fulci serve up for fans in this potential bloodbath?

Well, not that much actually! An early graphic throat slashing turns out to be merely an image projected into the mind of a game-show contestant; much of the motorbike mayhem results in bodies being either blown up or crushed, but with very little gore on display; and the brief decapitation of a gladiator ends with a shot of the neck spurting blood.

For maximum enjoyment, I advise viewers to sit back, forget about the lack of splatter, and just revel in the sheer silliness of the whole thing: the incredibly bad Bladerunner-style cityscapes; the entertaining chariot race featuring really naff-looking, customised bikes; and the fact that, somehow, not only do all of the condemned criminals know how to ride a motorbike, but they can all effortlessly pop a prolonged wheelie!",5,"['Action', 'Sci-Fi', 'Thriller']","['timeframe 2000s', 'flying car', 'punk rocker', 'night cityscape', 'game']",1984-01-28,['Lucio Fulci'],"['Jared Martin', 'Fred Williamson', 'Howard Ross']","['Elisa Briganti', 'Cesare Frugoni', 'Lucio Fulci']"
The New Kids,"A brother and sister arrive in a small town to help their relatives run an amusement park, and they find the town is terrorized by a local street gang.","The New Kids is probably best for fans of the cast or anyone satisfied by mediocre teen 80s movies. This is one of those movies about a bunch of psychotic weirdos trying to do as much damage as possible to two innocent victims, leaving you to wonder what the heck these kids did to push the antagonists so far over the edge.

Here, our innocent victims are Abby (Lori Laughlin) and Loren (Shannon Presby). After their parents died, the brother and sister go to live in an amusement park (how awesome is that?) where their relatives (surrogate parent-types) live and work.

The psychos are led by Eddie Dutra (James Spader) a sadistic albino, and his gang of merry men (one of which is the excellent John Philbin who 80s fans will remember as &apos;Turtle&apos; from the surf adventure, North Shore). Anyways, Eddie wants Abby, and what Eddie wants, he gets. But when Abby pushes him away after several forceful advances, sadistic control-freak Eddie doesn&apos;t want it to look like he let a girl weaken him. He and the gang go after Lorren, Abby, and their family, in a do or die situation.

 Despite having a decent finale of chases and destruction, the movie has a very simple story. Unfortunately, it can also be quite sappy during those brother-sister inspiration talks. Abby and Lorren are willing to fight back against Eddie and his gang once and for all after so many of his vicious acts against them and their family, but for such tough kids (especially Abby), they do seem to come off as bitterly sappy sometimes.

 Unfortunately, too, the movie has a very simple story. I watched it on the Spanish Channel (I don&apos;t understand Spanish) and I figured everything out alright. It&apos;s a generic story, but one you&apos;ll like if that&apos;s what you&apos;re into or if you&apos;re fans of the actors in this film.",7,"['Crime', 'Drama', 'Horror']","['violence', 'aunt nephew relationship', 'woman in a shower', 'female in a shower', 'kidnapping']",1985-01-18,['Sean S.

Nuit et brouillard,The history of Nazi Germany&apos;s death camps of the Final Solution and the hellish world of dehumanization and death contained inside.,"Resnais intersperses then-current-day (1955) color footage of Auschwitz with archival B&W to demystify and provide context for the Holocaust in modern western society rather than in anything unique to the German experience of totalitarianism. Photos of concentration camp personnel at home with their families invite the viewer to reflect on the banality of evil. Construction of the camps is described as like that of any large project, requiring bids, architects, contracts. Heart-wrenching scenes document a prisoner&apos;s view, from the transports being loaded through selections, showers/gas chambers, existence in the barracks, and in the end, mass death.

Included on the DVD is an excerpt from a 1994 radio interview with Resnais, wherein he mentions French censors required the film makers to obscure the hat of a policeman guarding prisoners being deported - the French government refused to permit this recognition of French complicity and assistance with the deportations.",10,"['Documentary', 'Short', 'History']","['nazi', 'prison', 'nurse', 'doctor', '1940s']",,['Alain Resnais'],"['Michel Bouquet', 'Reinhard Heydrich', 'Heinrich Himmler']",['Jean Cayrol']

La notte che Evelyn uscì dalla tomba,"A rich, mentally-unstable man - with a penchant for playing deadly S&M games with women who resemble his dead wife - sparks off a chain of bizarre events after getting remarried.","Alan (Anthony Steffen), an English multi-millionaire with a few screws loose (thanks to his first wife&apos;s infidelity and untimely death during childbirth), entices sexy, red-headed women to his castle, offering them bundles of cash to stay the weekend. Once back at his ancestral pile, he gets them nekkid, proceeds to flog them with a bull-whip, and then kills them.

But when he meets blonde hottie Gladys (Marina Malfatti) and falls for her ample charms, he decides to give up his murderous ways and get married. Their wedded bliss is short-lived, however, thanks to Alan&apos;s iffy mental state, which becomes increasingly fragile when his dead wife Evelyn starts to appear outside his window and a spate of gruesome murders occur within the castle grounds.

So let&apos;s recap: a groovy 70s Euro-horror with loads of tasty women in various states of undress; spooky Gothic retreats and misty graveyards; a sadistic rich psycho with a penchant for drop-dead gorgeous babes with cracking bods; several vicious murders (including a great bit where one victim has her head bashed in with a rock and her entrails eaten by foxes). Normally, a checklist like that would guarantee me a good timeso why did I find &apos;The Night Evelyn Came Out Of Her Grave&apos; so dull? Well, for starters, the plot is way too convoluted: there are red herrings, crazy plot developments, and suspects galore, and it all becomes a bit too much. By the ridiculous endingin which we discover that, all along, several people have been plotting to get their greedy paws on Alan&apos;s wealth, and that our red-head killing nut-job is actually supposed to be the hero of the moviemy head was hurting too much to care! Secondly, Emilio Maraglia&apos;s direction is pretty torpid. Stylish, yes; but as slow as molasses at times.

And then there&apos;s the bits that are just too damn silly, possibly even for a giallo: the death by poisonous snake bite (surely one of the most bizarre choices of weapon ever); Alan&apos;s Aunt Agatha, an old crippled relative who is played by a pretty young woman; the hiring of a group of identical curly headed blondes as maids; the poor attempt at convincing the audience that the film is set in England (mentioning &apos;pounds&apos; and hiring a crap police uniform for one of the extras is not enough); and then, of course, there is the unlikelihood of finding a bag of sulphuric acid laying next to a swimming pool...

&apos;The Night Evelyn Came Out Of Her Grave&apos; isn&apos;t a total waste of time (how could it be, with so much female flesh on show?), but there are much better giallo&apos;s out there.

Night Monster,"Kurt Ingston, a rich recluse, invites the doctors who left him a hopeless cripple to his desolate mansion in the swamps as one by one they meet horrible deaths.","Crippled Kurt Ingston (Ralph Morgan) has no arms or legs despite the fact that three doctors tried to save him (from what is never said).

I caught this on late night TV when I was a kid and remember being pleasurably spooked by it. It&apos;s nice to see it still holds up all these years later. First off don&apos;t let the top billing of Bela Lugosi and Lionel Atwill fool you--they&apos;re hardly in the movie. Lugosi is totally wasted as a sinister butler and Atwill chews the scenery but is gone halfway through the movie. Most of it deals with Morgan and various supporting characters. The good thing is all the supporting actors are interesting and well-acted especially by Leif Erickson as a lecherous chauffeur and Nils Asther as a sinister yogi. The direction is very good and the movie has a nice dark atmosphere. There&apos;s a VERY spooky scene where one of the doctors is approached by the killer. Another nice touch is all the frogs and animals in the swamp surrounding the estate go dead quiet when the killer appears. The sudden dead silence is more than a little unnerving. The final sequence when you find out who the killer is doesn&apos;t make a lot of sense but the movie is so good that you let that go. A low-budget horror from Universal that is exceptionally well-done. I give it an 8.",8,"['Adventure', 'Crime', 'Drama']","['b movie', 'gate guard', 'chauffeur', 'housemaid', 'woman in jeopardy']",1942-10-20,['Ford Beebe'],"['Bela Lugosi', 'Lionel Atwill', 'Leif Erickson']",['Clarence Upson Young']

The sequence that shows what they told to the police is characteristic of Ed Wood´s way of work; we can see the old couple driving and taking a shortcut that lead them to pass in front the house. You can watch that sometimes some scenes show daylight -as a close shot of the house- while another shows the dark -when appear the ghost in black dress-. I laugh each time I watch the flying trumpet and the ghost of the whooping whistle. I like too the head grimacing and wearing I think, an explorer´s hat with the mark of pirates.

Expressionism vs. naturalism, fable vs. social commentary, dream vs. reality, convention vs. experiment. Yet somehow these disparate elements not only hold together, they soar together, into film making heights. I&apos;m almost tempted to say miraculously so, because on paper such opposing styles would seem to resist any kind of meaningful synthesis. Yet there it is, on the screen, an almost seamless work of movie-making art. After so many reviews - a testament to Hunter&apos;s mesmerizing effect - there is little left to say. Except to observe that if the film&apos;s brain is Director Laughton, and its eyes Stanley Cortez, then its heart (which is considerable) comes from screen writer James Agee. Literary conscience of the Great Depression, Agee makes of this modern day fairy tale a moving tribute to children of all times who have had to struggle against forces so much bigger and more knowing than themselves. Cast adrift in an alien world, they can only hope for the best, which amounts to trusting in the presence somewhere of a benevolent force to protect them. John and Pearl are lucky. Other children as Agee well knew are not so lucky. In an odd way, this is a conscionable movie about spiritual compassion that Hollywood too often turned into emotional mush, but not here. Too bad this neglected masterpiece was not so recognized during Laughton&apos;s lifetime.",,"['Crime', 'Drama', 'Film-Noir']","['widow', 'preacher', 'southern gothic', 'spanking', 'psychopath']",1955-07-27,['Charles Laughton'],"['Robert Mitchum', 'Shelley Winters', 'Lillian Gish']","['Davis Grubb', 'James Agee', 'Charles Laughton']"

However deep inside he longs for more than the horror and scares of Halloween Town, a longing he cannot understand until he stumbles into Christmas Town and sees happiness and cheer the likes of which has evaded him all these years. Having finally worked out what Christmas is all about, Jack decides to kidnap Santa and make himself the new king of Christmas Town so that he can have the happiness of Christmas all the time. But the others in the towns realize the significant consequences that this disruption of the norm will have as Jack&apos;s evil nature proves harder to overcome than he thought.

With Pixar currently dominating the world of &apos;animations that please both children and adults&apos; it is easy to forget that over a decade ago Tim Burton delivered this delightful family film to the cinema using a much more traditional animation and a huge amount of imagination. The basic plot is a great little fantasy fairytale with a very dark heart to it that make it much more enjoyable for having that edge. Too often kids films (especially at the time and animated) are soaked in a sweet sentiment that simply forgets that kids are not stupid and indeed often prefer a bit of darkness in the story. The only downside of this darkness is that younger children might not &apos;get it&apos; and just end up being scared by the Halloween images and imaginative images. Despite this the material will play equally well to adults and children because it neither panders to nor excludes one group over the other at any time. Regardless of the material, the film still manages to come off as charming and enjoyable thanks to a well-written script that never plays for the basic laugh or easy sentiment. Some viewers may come to this with Pixar in their minds and bemoan it for not being hilariously funny from start to finish, but they are missing the point and

The songs reflect this approach and are very clever throughout; whether it is the sorrowful longing of Jack at the start or the Cab Calloway-inspired song from Oogie Boogie Man, generally they are inventive and fun. The same praise can be laid at the door of the stop-motion animation, which is inventive and fun to look at from start to finish. All the characters have a great deal of effort put in and they add to the dark feel of the film. The voice cast may not feature a load of well-known voices in the same way as Pixar films generally do, but they still do a great job. Sarandon and Elfman combine to do a good job with Jack; Page is fun as Oogie Boogie; O&apos;Hara is good as Sally despite not having as fun a character to work with but for my money it is Hickey (as Dr Finklestein) and Shadix (Mayor) that make the biggest impression, mainly due to having the most enjoyable characters.

Overall this is a very short but very enjoyable film that will please both children and adults at the same time (with the same material) and never ignores or panders to one side of the audience over the other. Both groups will appreciate the dark fairytale, the clever songs, the darkly imaginative animation and the comic sense of humour, making this a family film that deserves to be remembered even as kids movie get smarter and fancier.",,"['Animation', 'Family', 'Fantasy']","['christmas', 'halloween', 'stop motion animation', 'santa claus character', 'villain']",1993-10-29,['Henry Selick'],"['Danny Elfman', 'Chris Sarandon', 'Catherine O&apos;Hara']","['Tim Burton', 'Michael McDowell', 'Caroline Thompson']"

A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors,A psychiatrist familiar with knife-wielding dream demon Freddy Krueger helps teens at a mental hospital battle the killer who is invading their dreams.,"I&apos;ve been a fan of Chuck Russell&apos;s films ever since his 1994 classic THE MASK. Each one of his movies have a strong amount of slickness and energy, especially A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 3: DREAM WARRIORS. It&apos;s one of the better &apos;ELM STREET&apos; films in the series and was one of the cinematic highlights of 1987. Like THE LOST BOYS, which was also released in 1987, it has style, imagination, a good premise, and gore. It does have a few faults though. Some of the special effects are dated and look quite cheesy and the flick seems to rely more on blood than genuine scares at times. Also, while by no means terrible, Heather Langenkamp&apos;s performance is not quite up to par with her performance in the first &apos;ELM STREET&apos; and NEW NIGHTMARE. Occasionally it feels like she&apos;s phoning it in. These faults don&apos;t hurt the movie too much. It&apos;s still a enjoyable horror picture that holds up relatively well today. It may not be as good as the first A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, but it&apos;s much better than most third installments are. I give it 7/10.",,"['Fantasy', 'Horror']","['nightmare', 'dream', 'group of teenagers', 'dungeons and dragons', 'springwood ohio']",1987-02-27,['Chuck Russell'],"['Heather Langenkamp', 'Robert Englund', 'Craig Wasson']","['Wes Craven', 'Bruce Wagner', 'Frank Darabont']"
A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master,"Freddy Krueger returns once again to terrorize the dreams of the remaining Dream Warriors, as well as those of a young woman who may be able to defeat him for good.","A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master, the fourth installment in the Nightmare on Elm Street series. I was lucky enough to get the boxed DVD set of Nightmare on Elm Street series and I just finished all the sequels and while the fourth isn&apos;t a bad sequel or continuation of the story, it was pretty silly. It was cool to continue on with the dream warriors who were clever enough to defeat Freddy in the third Nightmare on Elm Street. But Freddy&apos;s back and he is more ticked off than ever and you know that&apos;s not good. But while the story was a good idea, the way it was executed, I wasn&apos;t really that into it, just the acting I think is what killed it for me. The way the movie was made was what made it feel like it was more of a cheesy TV show like on the Sci-fi Channel than an actual movie.

We start off where the third installment of the Nightmare on Elm Street series left off, the kids from the hospital are now grown up and are all on their own. But they are quickly killed off by Freddy hoping to get Kirsten back to help them, but they are too late. But when Kirsten finds a girl, Alice, she finds out that Alice has the same powers as she does. She has the ability to pull other people into her dreams and of course Alice is scared to find out how to use her powers, but she may just have to use them since Freddy is now after her and other kids too.

A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master was a good enough sequel, but it just could have been better. I liked it, but so far it&apos;s not my top favorite sequel. Again, we&apos;ve got some very cool deaths, don&apos;t think I could choose one, I think the water bed one was very cool. But once again, I don&apos;t wanna spoil it. Of course if you wanna see the Nightmare on Elm Street sequels, this is recommended, but as a horror movie on it&apos;s own, it&apos;s OK.

Nightmares,Anthology of four horror tales with a supernatural twist based on urban legends.,"Straight from the mid-80&apos;s comes the mild-mannered &apos;Nightmares,&apos; a horror anthology of four seemingly unrelated tales of terror that hardly deserve the R-rating they so unjustly received (the film was released one year before &apos;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,&apos; which resulted in the PG-13 rating, a rating this film deserves, if not a PG).

Segment one, &apos;Terror in Topanga,&apos; re-tells the old urban legend of a woman, an escaped psychopath, and a suspicious gas station attendant. In this case the woman is Lisa (Christina Raines), a cigarette smoker who needs a nic-fix so bad; she&apos;s willing to risk being horribly stabbed for some Marlboro 100&apos;s. I suspect the filmmakers were trying to comment on the health hazards of tobacco--something new in 1983. This is the third best, or second worst-depending on your point of view, segment of the film.

Segment two, &apos;The Bishop of Battle,&apos; on the other hand, is undeniably the best! It stars none other than a very young Emilio Estevez (&apos;the &apos;Mighty Ducks man himself!&apos;) as J.J. Cooney, a kid so good at arcade games, all the other kids stop playing to watch him. One game Cooney can&apos;t seem to beat is &apos;The Bishop of Battle,&apos; which supposedly has 13 levels, although it is believed level 13 is a myth as nobody has gotten past level 12 (Cooney claims he heard about &apos;a kid in New Jersey&apos; who did sotwice). Cooney becomes obsessed with surpassing level 12 and defeating &apos;The Bishop,&apos; the digital master/boss of &apos;The Bishop of Battle,&apos; he looks like an electronic-neon version of Magic Mirror from &apos;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.&apos; So obsessed does Cooney become, that he alienates his parents, sneaks out of his bedroom in the middle of the night, and breaks back into the arcade to take on &apos;The Bishop&apos; one more time. I won&apos;t spoil the funky ending; suffice to say it evokes &apos;Tron,&apos; sort of a &apos;Tron-in reverse.&apos; The most enjoyable aspect of Segment two is the lacquer of 1980&apos;s youth culture it evokes. Estevez sports a neon, sleeveless shirt and a Walkman the size of a toaster that blasts punk-rock as Cooney hustles amateurs in the tough arcades of Oakland. Back at the mall, one anonymously delivered line of dialog from an unseen member of Cooney&apos;s spectators is, I kid you not, &apos;Totally awesome!&apos; At one point, a flirtatious female friend asks him if he wants to &apos;Get a pizza!&apos; This isn&apos;t really the 1980&apos;s I remember, it&apos;s how I&apos;d like to remember them.

Horror legend Lance Hendriksen gives arguably the best performance of all segments in #3, &apos;The Benediction,&apos; as a priest in the American-Mexican wasteland who, after witnessing the pointless death of a child, loses his faith and begins the long trip home across the desert. On the way he encounters a demonic monster truck apparently intent on killing him &apos;Duel&apos; style. The truck is loud and deep black, with an upside down cross hanging in its rear-view mirror. At the stories climax, we see the truck literally burst out from the desert earth as if it were a surfacing submarine. It&apos;s a surprisingly effective, and very cool, moment in the film.

Despite a well tuned cast, &apos;Night of the Rat,&apos; the fourth segment, is terrible, the worst in the film, and a poor finale. It centers on the Houston family&apos;s encounter with, as the title so eloquently eludes, a giant rat. As if that weren&apos;t enough, the rat has psychic powers as well! Wife Claire is the protagonist, played by polished actor Veronica Cartwright, who tries to convince her arrogant husband Steven (mustached character actor Richard Massur, whose demeanor mirrors his dry-toast last name) to call an exterminator. But alas, Steve refuses, and it&apos;s not until the devil-rat almost kills their young daughter (future overdosee Bridgette Andersen in a phenomenal child performance) that he whips out the conveniently closet-stored shotgun and goes-a-rat huntin&apos;. The finale of &apos;Night of the Rat,&apos; is too awfully hilarious for words to define.

Overall, &apos;Nightmares,&apos; is too gentle to be scary. It reminded me of Nickelodeon&apos;s soft-core, &apos;Are You Afraid of the Dark?&apos; which also had happy endings and corny fables (although I remain a fan of that series). I would recommend this film only for the nostalgic &apos;The Bishop of Battle,&apos; Hendrickson&apos;s performance in &apos;The Benediction,&apos; and as an overall night of laughs for 80&apos;s horror connoisseurs. &apos;Creepshow,&apos; and &apos;Creepshow 2&apos; are far superior horror anthologies than this film. 

However I must admit I enjoyed it, in some ways, more than &apos;The Twilight Zone, The Movie.&apos;",,"['Horror', 'Sci-Fi']","['based on urban legend', 'urban legend', 'anthology', 'giant rat', 'close up of eyes']",1983-09-09,['Joseph Sargent'],"['Cristina Raines', 'Joe Lambie', 'Anthony James']","['Christopher Crowe', 'Jeffrey Bloom']"

No Name on the Bullet,"When hired killer John Gant rides into Lordsburg, the town&apos;s folk become paranoid as each leading citizen has enemies capable of using the services of a professional killer for personal revenge.","Audie Murphy (as John Gant) plays it real smooth here. He manipulates the whole town &apos;leading citizens&apos; into thinking which one is the one he&apos;s after (that he&apos;s been hired to kill), and leaves them all feeling quite guilty over their past misdeeds. So guilty that the town banker commits suicide, and a couple of others start shooting one another without Gant ever having to lift a finger. 

This is one of the few times you&apos;ll see Murphy play a bad guy, although quite different from the unhinged character you&apos;d later see him play in John Huston&apos;s THE UNFORGIVEN (1960). Nothing he did acting-wise, ever topped that one.

Universal has released the widescreen Technicolor DVD of this and it&apos;s the best way to see it. No speckling and only a couple of brief frame blemishes. Sound is excellent, although the only extra is a trailer.

Now if Universal will only see fit to release the following excellent Audiepix westerns on DVD, I&apos;d be a happy man:

SEVEN WAYS FROM SUNDOWN (1960) w. Barry Sullivan; RIDE CLEAR OF DIABLO (1954) w. Dan Duryea; HELL BENT FOR LEATHER (1960) w. Steven McNally; and RIDE A CROOKED TRAIL (1958) w. Walter Matthau

So if you all liked NO NAME ON THE BULLET, then I bet you&apos;ll probably like the four I listed up above. They&apos;re all solid oaters.

No Such Thing,The story of a young journalist who journeys to Iceland to find her missing fiancé only to encounter a mythical creature. She eventually forges a relationship with the being.,"As individuals, or collectively as a society, what is it, exactly, that we are afraid of? Since the beginning of time, what has really been behind all those knee-jerk reactions that have brought us to where we are today? These are the questions posed (and answered) by writer/director Hal Hartley in `No Such Thing,&apos; an often biting satire of the news media, the all-to-prevalent-in-our-society tabloid-type mentality and our response to the unknown, be it tangible or imaginary; a film that brings us face to face with fear and confronts it with humor, pathos and Hartley&apos;s own insightful and inimitable take on the human condition.

Some time after a three-man television news team disappears after being sent to Iceland to investigate reports of a `monster&apos; living on a rock island just off the coast, the station receives a tape recording from someone claiming to be the monster himself, describing in graphic detail what he did with those dispatched to find and film him. `The Boss (Helen Mirren)&apos; of the news department, in her quest to give the public the `worst news&apos; possible, agrees to send another employee, Beatrice (Sarah Polley), to Iceland to follow up on it, since Beatrice was engaged to the cameraman of the crew gone missing.

After a temporary delay due to circumstances beyond her control, Beatrice finally makes it to Iceland, where she has to trek to a remote village on the coast (the final leg of which she has to walk, as even horses can&apos;t make it through). Once there, the locals tell their tales of the `monster,&apos; who has apparently always been with them, and point out to her the rock upon which he is purported to live. And Beatrice finds herself at the point of no return; she has come this far, and now it&apos;s just a matter of getting some help from the villagers to get her across the channel to the rock-- and her encounter with this monster who is `changeless and eternal.&apos;

As no one else can, Hal Hartley has crafted and delivered a film that is part `Beauty and the Beast,&apos; part `Frankenstein,&apos; part `Forbidden Planet,&apos; and ALL Hartley. Unlike most films featuring a `monster,&apos; Hartley does not keep his audience in suspense, but reveals his `man/beast&apos; at the very beginning, as we see him making the tape he subsequently sends to the T.V. station. And he&apos;s an ugly spud (credit goes to Mark Rappaport for special effects makeup), unique among all of the monsters in cinematic history. Hartley&apos;s creation affects a John Wayne countenance, drinks too much and speaks perfect English (how this can be so is ultimately revealed). Hartley then layers one unexpected event upon another, using black comedy to present a scathing social commentary, incisively composed through his keen insights into human nature. The allegory of the tale is concealed in who this monster really is, and what he wants, and it brings to mind Dr. Morbius and the secrets of the Krell. 

Absent in this film is the trademark cadence Hartley generally has his actors employ through a very deliberate delivery of their lines, and it is missed, as it is one of the elements that makes his films so engaging, creating as it does a fairly hypnotic effect (similar to the method employed by David Mamet in his films). Still, the Hartley magic is alive and well, and by keeping his volatile monster front and center throughout the film, rather than as a mysterious entity hidden in the shadows to whom he merely alludes, he succeeds in keeping his audience totally involved. Hartley is also a master of `thinking outside the box,&apos; which enables him to offer entirely unique perspectives on the human condition and this thing we call `life&apos;; you never know where he&apos;s going to take you, which is another reason why his films are so engaging (as this one certainly is). He knows how to make that all-important connection with his audience, but he chooses to do it indirectly, offering thought-provoking scenarios in a way that gives his viewer the option of coming on board or standing by while the ship sails; a kind of `you can lead a horse to water,&apos; proposition that most filmmakers would not have the courage to employ. Keep in mind, though, that once you hit the deck with Hartley, the rewards are many and great.

Working with Hartley for the first time, Sarah Polley proves to be a quick study in all things Hartley; in creating Beatrice, she demonstrates an innate grasp of his methods, and most importantly, what it is he is attempting to accomplish through his characters. And this has to be a challenge to any actor; just as not every actor can work with Woody Allen because of his approach, it would seemingly be difficult with Hartley because of his unique perspectives. Whatever the case may be, Polley succeeds splendidly, presenting a convincing character who is decidedly all `Hartley.&apos;

Helen Mirren, too, demonstrates her versatility and consummate professionalism by falling into Hartley&apos;s rhythms with apparent facility. The role of `The Boss&apos; is something of a departure for Mirren, but she immerses herself in the character with gusto and makes The Boss believable. And she seems to be enjoying herself immensely in doing so. A terrific actor, she&apos;s a joy to watch in this one.

As the monster, Hartley regular Robert John Burke steals the show by creating a monster that is so stunningly atypical; this beast has a fearless swagger and the wisdom of millennia to back it up. Burke readily conveys his disdain for human beings with terms and a tone that fairly drips with cynicism, and it is in his portrayal that we find both the real humor and the pathos of the film. 

The supporting cast includes Baltasar Kormakur (Artaud), Julie Christie (Dr. Anna) and Stacy Dawson (Mugger). Off-beat and entertaining, `No Such Thing&apos; is a unique experience that is going to make you think a bit. 9/10.",9,"['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Fantasy']","['monster', 'iceland', 'rural setting', 'surgery', 'airplane crash']",2002-11-15,['Hal Hartley'],"['Sarah Polley', 'Robert John Burke', 'Margrét Ákadóttir']",['Hal Hartley']

This movie is guaranteed to keep you entertained. the acting is really quite good, as well as, Traci Lords is super hott and has a great body.

"Not Quite Hollywood: The Wild, Untold Story of Ozploitation!",The story of the Australian exploitation genre cinema of 1970s and 80s.,"I have wanted to see this film since I saw it advertised at the Melbourne Film festival so naturally I had to see it opening night when it came to my local cinema, I saw it last night and what can I say, it was fantastic, I had no idea that Australia made so many films in the 70&apos;s and 80&apos;s.

The film features interviews with a lot of Australian directors, filmmakers, critics, some A list Hollywood actors and even Quentin Tarantino, who has an unbelievable knowledge of Australian exploitation cinema. 

The film explores the good, the bad and the ugly of Australian genre films. There is no doubt that there were some pretty dodgy ones made at the time but there is no denying that there were also some real gems made as well, it&apos;s just a shame that they seemed to do better overseas than they did here.

Weather you are interested in Australian film, Australian culture, or just film in general I highly recommend seeing this film. Listening to the filmmakers stories about how they made there films is both amusing and inspiring. 

Over all this is a fun movie that should be seen in the theater.",10,"['Documentary', 'History']","['comma in title', 'archive footage', 'reference to john grey gorton', 'reference to gough whitlam', 'australian western']",2008-08-28,['Mark Hartley'],"['Phillip Adams', 'Glory Annen', 'Christine Amor']",['Mark Hartley']

Now You See Me,"An F.B.I.

It&apos;s all about appearances and show in this one, rather than actually being brilliant, the characters and story just ask you take their brilliance for granted. 

The story revolves around illusionists (implicitly portrayed as demigods I would say) and how they manage to fool everyone and get a little fooled themselves. Of course, with all this fooling around there are always chances that something might strike the funny bone, that is to say it has its humorous moments now and then but on the whole the illusions and tricks etc. is just more of a dazzle than something logical and realistic. There is not much depth to the characters and a lot of misdirection to make the climax more effective, but the misdirection only adds to the illogical nature of the plot and makes the story hollow.

Having criticized enough the good parts for me were the cocky-as-usual Jesse Eisenberg and some of the funny moments but nothing else. Even the dazzle of the magic tricks was made slow and plain by all the simple filler like dialogues.

The Nude Bomb plays as a spoof of James Bond movies. James Bond films ALREADY are a spoof so that was a bad idea. The film didn&apos;t realize that the cold war was over. Terrible, terrible Turkey. Don Adams would reunite with most of the Get Smart gang in the much superior Get Smart...Again! which picks up the original story line as it has progressed in the future and spoofs the fact that the cold war and spy era is virtually over.

La vampire nue,"A young man falls in love with a beautiful woman being chased by sinister masked figures at night. He tries to track her down, and learns she&apos;s being held captive by his father and colleagues who believe she&apos;s a vampire.","Rollin in his usual mode impresses with place, color, dreamlike reverie. His women are unappealingly scrawny and bland, but his teasing of the cinematic imagination works for me enough to want to step in his ether - his films feel much less constructed than what passes as sensual these days, the night air and architectural walls of the thing always feel real, the texture real. 

The film opens with a distraught &apos;virgin&apos; being followed in dark streets by mysterious masked figures, everything in the film that is of that same somnambulist quality carries resonance and I would not dissuade you from watching. It really is fine in ways that you will seldom see in a horror film and that Kubrick bombastically killed in Eyes Wide Shut (it breathes here).

But damn it all to hell, if he isn&apos;t utterly inept as a storyteller and ruins every pleasure of touch. I don&apos;t mean that he wants to confound logic, I like that he does. I welcome filmmakers of the sort - Lynch, Ruiz, Zulawski, those who tether you to narrative threads you have much less control of than usual then pull and leave you scudding through the shattered story-parts.

It&apos;s quite the opposite with Rollin. Though the world feels real, the interplay of story dynamics is cartoonish at best. Every initially baffling element has to be explained in due time, and each explanation is dumber than a sack of rocks. He is not illogical in the sense that we cannot fathom more than bits of a deeply inscrutable world, quite simply he jots down a coherent story from a few absurd/fantastical elements then gives it to us in conveniently random ways.

In this case, the movie about vampires is a horror show being put on, the vampires are only vampires because we believe they are. This is repeatedly stressed out for us.

The point of all this is apparently the celebration of the rigor and &apos;purity&apos; of youth, remember those where the Vietnam years, who in Rollin&apos;s garbled set of metaphors are equated with a mutant race of immortals.

Rollin&apos;s problem is that he is not content to be a perfume master who seduces the senses, he wants to be a bit like the meditating mentor in this film, someone who promises initiation into the &apos;hidden dimension&apos; of truths so he ends up being as silly.",,['Horror'],"['vampire', 'real twins playing twins', 'mutant', 'espionage', 'murder']",1970-05-20,['Jean Rollin'],"['Caroline Cartier', 'Olivier Rollin', 'Maurice Lemaître']","['Jean Rollin', 'Serge Moati']"

My conclusion upon doing so is that the other reviews must have been written by cast, crew and investors - this film is awful, awful, awful and I really cannot think of one good thing to say about it. It&apos;s not &apos;so bad it&apos;s good&apos; - it&apos;s just plain bad! This film could have been written, acted and directed by high school students and as such has no aesthetic whatsoever.

Yes, there are beautiful girls and plenty of boobs and stocking tops on show for those boys going through puberty to enjoy but the blood scenes might prove a bit daunting for a 13 year old

I suppose it can be classed as a black comedy horror that even Ray Bradbury could not have thought of.

I can&apos;t remember seeing another film where a woman is wearing a bra but no knickers.

The film could have been a whole lot more but there is a moral to the story which will give disaffected husbands nightmares.

I appreciate that these are modern times and the PC gang are out in full force; so many films and TV shows these days make men out to be weak and feeble and women so strong and dominant (ok, so there are men that like that sort of thing)but surely some sort of parity is needed.

On the plus side, the end is not what you would normally predict to happen but I am sure there is no-one demanding a sequel anyway.

The film is a bit short but more than adequate enough to pleasure the desires of many of it&apos;s viewers.

The film is about James Bond (Roger Moore) is given an assignment to solve the murder of agent 009 after carrying a fake Fabergé egg.

He ends up going to India, and meets Octopussy (Maud Adams) who runs a circus, but is also a jewel smuggler and a theft. Bond must team up with her in order to retrieve the egg and save the day.

Octopussy was great. The idea of it taking place at a circus may be silly, but it actually worked with an accurate script and a good story. The action wasn&apos;t as mind blowing as some of the other Bond films, but was still worthwhile.

Acting was great again. Roger Moore did an awesome job as Bond in this one, and Maud Adams was stunning as Octopussy. Louis Jourdan made a decent villan for the film. Not one of my favorites, but still good.

The crack began in the mid to late 60s, and we started to question why some had and others didn&apos;t, why a church held such power over our lives, why love could not be shared by all, black and white, straight and gay.

Office Space,Three company workers who hate their jobs decide to rebel against their greedy boss.,"Every aggravating thing about working in an office, from the traffic on the way to work to that damn copier, is in this movie, and dealt with in ways that we&apos;ve all wanted to, at some point or another. Well, except for the traffic, of course. The traffic remains undefeated. Besides telling a highly amusing story about office workers who are just fed up with it all, Office Space is full of other little comments on society, such as the way the film points out the sheer goofiness of geeky white guys who listen to hardcore rap music. The film presents a heavily exaggerated version of the typical office, but underneath that exaggeration, the depiction is very accurate. You have the fairly timid but passive aggressive superior, Bill Lumbergh, portrayed hilariously by Gary Cole, the repressive office cubicles, the mumbly guy that kind of weirds everyone out, and of course, the disillusioned office employee who just doesn&apos;t care anymore.

Ron Livingston fulfills this last role very well, being very open about his dislike of his job and his intentions to do as little as possible for as long as he still gets paid, but it is the weird guy that really gets laughs consistently, whose name, in this case, is Milton. This guy&apos;s hilarious situation involves having been laid off years before without knowing because no one told him, because he still receives a paycheck due to a glitch in the payroll system, and whose primary concerns seem to be the location of his cubicle, his red stapler, and the fact that last year, he didn&apos;t receive a piece of cake at the office party. The way that this guy&apos;s situation gets consistently worse and the way that he is pushed further and further toward the edge of sanity is one of the funniest things about this movie. And we can&apos;t forget the Indian guy, Samir, whose grammatically flawed exclamations also provide for an endless source of comedic entertainment.

Jennifer Aniston plays a small role as Peter Gibbons&apos; (Livingston) love interest, as well as that of a waitress who is also sick and tired of the ridiculousness of her job (such as a specified minimum of pieces of `flair&apos; that employees must wear to work). Ron&apos;s home life is another thing that is parodied in this high quality comedy, as the shortcomings of living in an average apartment are clearly and side-splittingly portrayed. Clearly, the office scenes are by far the funniest of the film, and the eventual criminal plot to embezzle a huge sum of money from the company and take up a lifestyle of not really doing anything, despite the fact that it is also very well done, can be largely overlooked because of the sheer hilarity of the rest of the film. This is excellent stuff from the famous creator of the endlessly amusing Beavis & Butt-Head who, with Office Space, has further proved that he is just the type of guy who knows what&apos;s funny.",9,['Comedy'],"['black comedy', 'boss', 'office', 'computer', 'corporation']",1999-02-19,['Mike Judge'],"['Ron Livingston', 'Jennifer Aniston', 'David Herman']",['Mike Judge']

Oklahoma Crude,"In 1913, in Oklahoma, oil derrick owner Lena Doyle (Faye Dunaway), aided by her father (Sir John Mills) and a hobo (George C.

It does, however, suffer from an identity crisis. Is it a comedy? Is it a drama? Is it a western? It&apos;s not really any of those. Nor, thankfully, is it one of Kramer&apos;s social issue epics. Faye Dunaway gives it her all as a demented wild-catter trying to get oil from a lone well while keeping the big time oil companies off her land. She&apos;s helped out by her ne&apos;er do well father John Mills and a hapless drifter played by George C. Scott. Scott and Dunaway have great chemistry and Kramer wisely downplays any love story. However, although they make a scrappy team, they&apos;re not particularly likable. In fact, none of the characters in this film is very pleasant, therefore there&apos;s nobody to really root for. 

Kramer, like his contemporaries Billy Wilder and Otto Preminger, seemed to have lost his way by the 1970s. OKLAHOMA CRUDE doesn&apos;t click as comedy or drama. The actors are poorly directed: Dunaway is completely humorless, while Scott plays his part as if he&apos;s in a broad farce. Jack Palance, as the villain, appears to be spoofing his own clenched jaw persona.",4,"['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Western']","['oil derrick', 'cigar smoking', 'nudity', 'timeframe 1910s', 'pumpjack']",1973-08-24,['Stanley Kramer'],"['George C.

The Old Dark House,"Seeking shelter from a storm, five travelers are in for a bizarre and terrifying night when they stumble upon the Femm family estate.","First one carload of normal people who can&apos;t go on due to flash flooding stop in a Gothic horror house for food and shelter and then another. Strange doings are happening at the house occupied by the Femm family and their mute servant Morgan.

You can&apos;t really say there is any kind of coherent plot to the unfolding events and plot for me is usually the one indispensable part of any film. But in this case I make an exception because obviously Director James Whale was having a little fun with the audience by now used to Universal Studios horror film products. Whale creates a film of dark moods and light banter among the guests who can&apos;t quite figure out what&apos;s with this family of weirdos.

The Old Dark House marked the American film debut of Charles Laughton and Laughton overacts outrageously as does the whole cast in the role a bluff, overbearing, but essentially good hearted Manchester businessman who&apos;s got himself a Sir before his name and is right proud of it. This was also early work for Melvyn Douglas and Raymond Massey as another two of the guests. 

Boris Karloff plays the sinister and mute servant Morgan. Karloff had one of the great speaking voices ever in films and interesting that this and his break through role as the Frankenstein monster required no dialog. 

The Old Dark House is one great Halloween movie and listen close to the campy dialog that will tickle your funny bone if you don&apos;t miss it.",7,"['Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Drama']","['storm', 'butler', 'guest', 'night', 'fear']",1932-10-20,['James Whale'],"['Boris Karloff', 'Melvyn Douglas', 'Charles Laughton']","['J.B.

Old School,Three friends attempt to recapture their glory days by opening up a fraternity near their alma mater.,"Much like the tradition of the raunchy flicks of the 80s, Old School encompasses the age old tradition of tactless and tasteless film creation. Buy the oddity of the situation, this is one of those films I can tolerate. Mid-life malaise couldn&apos;t have been drawn better in the lives of Mitch, Frank and Beanie. Men who serve no purpose in society, especially to their significant others. But that&apos;s the significance of the frat house. No, it isn&apos;t about being drunk and hitting on 19-year-old girls, its about reaffirming your role in society and making the inner soul feel good and relaxed.

Oliver!,"After being sold to a mortician, young orphan Oliver Twist runs away and meets a group of boys trained to be pickpockets by an elderly mentor in 1830s London.","Charles Dickens famous novel of an orphan boy, Oliver Twist, who escapes from his poor life to seek his fame and fortune in London, is adapted as a glossy musical.

Who would have thought that a story from the brilliant Dickens could be so sweet and endearing? So it be with Carol Reed&apos;s (Best Director Winner) unforgettable 1968 Best Picture Winner. Yes it&apos;s some way away from the essence of the source, those in need of that should be seeking out David Lean&apos;s fabulous 1948 version, but with an array of wonderful tunes and choreography, this Oliver is a treat for all the family. The cast are uniformly strong, notably Ron Moody (Fagin), Oliver Reed (who as Bill Sykes is probably playing himself!), Mark Lester (Oliver) and the fabulous Jack Wild (The Artful Dodger). While Lionel Bart&apos;s songs are as timeless as they are engaging.

The 60s was a tough decade for cinematic musicals, with many of them turning out to be bloated exercises in tedium. But Oliver! is one of the shining lights in the genre, a true uplifter guaranteed to have the feet a tapping and the smile firmly implanted on ones face.

The Omega Man,Biological war has decimated life on Earth. Los Angeles is a windswept ghost town where Robert Neville tools his convertible through sunlit streets foraging for supplies.,"A vampiric cult called The Family the result of biological warfare, lay siege to the refuge of the last man left alive in a dead post-apocalyptic city.

This is the second cinematic outing for the Richard Matheson novel I Am Legend with Charlton Heston as Robert Neville immune to the plague & fighting for survival. This is an entertaining film if not on a par with some of Hestons other sci-fi movies such as Planet Of The Apes & Soylent Green. Again he gives us an isolated, cynical man who never sets out to be a hero but becomes one.

How would you cope as the only man alive? The superior opening act of this movie answers that with the protagonist wandering through a dead city. Constantly reminded of the past with every step along every street & talking to himself, trying to retain his sanity. Indeed one of the best scenes of the whole movie is here when he watches Woodstock in an empty cinema, reciting the dialogue. Just how many times has he done this? Then the film goes down familiar action movie routes with The Family a bizarre religious anti-technology cult & Nevilles attempts to combat their attacks.

The Omega Man doesn&apos;t have as much depth amongst the action as Planet Of The Apes but has a great & tangible sense of isolation. The Family may not be the most threatening bad guys ever (one of the films flaws) but look good in their cowls & capes, a religious theme which is played out in the wonderful final image at the films climax which offers hope for the future.

Overall this film is enjoyable with its slightly comic book sensibilities, good score & strong religious overtones.

The Omen,Mysterious deaths surround an American ambassador. Could the child that he is raising actually be the Antichrist? The Devil&apos;s own son?,"This movie plays with the intellect. It is frightening for what is not seen. From the grey overcast that blurs the skies of London and the dead stillness of the great Pereford mansion that houses the ill-fated Thorn family to the deepest recesses of civilization in the hollow underground of an ancient excavation site, the film effectively captures the viewer&apos;s interest and draws them into a world that is on the verge of the ultimate disaster - the birth of the anti-Christ.

 Born into the world of politics and wealth, little Damien Thorn is the darling of the beautiful and privileged Robert and Katherine Thorn. Mysterious accidents and the overall feeling of death begin to shadow their lives until the horrifying truth of Damien&apos;s birth is uncovered millions of miles away in a grave in a decaying pagan cemetery in Italy. Gregory Peck gives a fine performance as ambitious politico Robert Thorn, a man who slowly discovers that his fate is interlinked in ancient biblical prophecy. With escalating horror, he uncovers a grand design that&apos;s unfolding under the unsuspecting eyes of the entire world - and he and his perfect family are at the centre of it. His search for the truth is one of the best in films, taking him to the farthest reaches of the globe and climaxing in an exciting and bizarre confrontation between himself and the face of evil.

 Lee Remick is ethereal as his beautiful and tragic wife. The rest of the cast - Billie Whitelaw as the creepy Mrs. Baylock, David Warner as the doomed Jennings and Leo McKern as the mysterious archaeologist Bugenhagen - give the movie its singular dark and moody quality. THE OMEN has a few disturbing moments that shock rather than disgust, but the film is loaded with memorable scenes that are ingenious. It&apos;s the &apos;feeling&apos; that the film incites that makes this movie unique. The haunted performances of the actors, the creepy-crawly musical score, the insinuation that doom is slowly creeping into the world with the birth of one lone child, all succeed in making THE OMEN one of the truest horror films.

 Sometimes it&apos;s the knowing that something is going to happen that is more frightening than actually seeing it happen ...",,"['Horror', 'Mystery']","['nanny', 'priest', 'hospital', 'catholic hospital', 'baby switch']",1976-06-25,['Richard Donner'],"['Gregory Peck', 'Lee Remick', 'Harvey Stephens']",['David Seltzer']
On Dangerous Ground,"Rough city cop Jim Wilson is disciplined by his captain and is sent upstate, to a snowy mountain town, to help the local sheriff solve a murder case.","On Dangerous Ground is directed by Nicholas Ray and stars Ida Lupino, Robert Ryan & Ward Bond. It&apos;s loosely adapted by Ray and A. I. Bezzerides from Gerald Butler&apos;s novel Mad With Much Heart. Cinematography is by George E. Diskant & the music is provided by Bernard Herrmann & Paul Sawtell. The story concerns Ryan&apos;s weary, lonely and psychologically bothered cop, Jim Wilson. Who after finally snapping the patience of his superiors is sent to Westham in the rural north to aid a murder case there. The idea is to get him off the streets he&apos;s so bitter about and to stop him finally going over the violence tinged edge. It&apos;s here, amongst the wintry landscapes, that he is brought into contact with Mary Malden (Lupino). A practically blind woman, Mary holds all the keys to the mystery and to the door at the end of Wilson&apos;s journey.

Right from the outset we are in no doubt that Nicholas Ray is about to take us on a noir journey. Herrmann&apos;s pulse like score accompanies its nighttime opening, Diskant&apos;s photography immediately painting a harsh city where life on the streets is tough. A place where loneliness can eat away at the soul and bleakness pours down off of the bars and the cheaply built apartments. It is in short, firmly encapsulating of Jim Wilson&apos;s bitterness and frame of mind. Wilson, once a prime athlete, is mired in solitude, his only telling contribution to society is his work, but that is ebbing away by the day. His mood is not helped by his partners, Pop & Pete, who can easily switch off once their shift has finished - but they have family to go home to, Wilson does not. Wilson&apos;s only source of joy comes courtesy of the paperboy he briefly plays football with out on the street (a rare ray of light in the film&apos;s moody atmospheric first half).

Then the film shifts for its second act, a shift that has made On Dangerous Ground a most divisive picture in discussions over the years. Sent north to effectively cool down by Captain Brawley (Ed Begley), we find Wilson leaving behind the dank city and entering the snowbound countryside in the north. Dark has become light as it were. The whole style and pace of the film has changed, yet this is still a place tainted by badness. A girl has been murdered and Wilson is still here to locate potential evil. An evil that the murdered girls father (Ward Bond as Walter Brent) wants to snuff out with his own vengeful fury. As the two men track down the killer, Wilson sees much of himself in Brent&apos;s anger, but once the guys arrive at Mary Malden&apos;s isolated cabin, things shift just a little more.

Said to be a favourite of Martin Scorsese, and an influence for Taxi Driver, On Dangerous Ground has often been called Nicholas Ray&apos;s best film by some of his fans (I&apos;d say In A Lonely Place personally). Odd then that Ray himself wasn&apos;t happy with the film, calling it a failure and not the finished product he had envisaged. Ray had wanted a three structured movie, not the two part one it is; with the final third being far bleaker and more noirish than the one we actually get. However, and the ending is a bit scratchy for the genre it sits in, it&apos;s still a fabulous film that is more about the journey of its protagonist than the diversity caused by its finale. Ryan is terrific, a real powerhouse and believable performance, while Lupino beautifully realises Mary&apos;s serene impact on Wilson and the counter opposite to the darkness within the picture. It&apos;s a given really, but Herrmann&apos;s score is potent, listen out for the opening, the crossover section from city to countryside and the rock face pursuit. While Ray directs with his customary knack of blending the grim with the almost poetic. 8/10",8,"['Drama', 'Film-Noir']","['murder', 'based on novel', 'shoulder holster', 'tough cop', 'deep snow']",1952-02-12,"['Nicholas Ray', 'Ida Lupino']","['Ida Lupino', 'Robert Ryan', 'Ward Bond']","['A.I.

On Her Majesty&apos;s Secret Service,James Bond woos a mob boss&apos; daughter and goes undercover to uncover the true reason for Ernst Stavro Blofeld&apos;s allergy research in the Swiss Alps involving beautiful women from around the world.,"Yeah, I think so. Like most people who are interested in James Bond, I saw the films over and over on TV before I read any of the books. I then got round to buying Casino Royale, and being knocked out by it - this was somewhat different to Moonraker and all that Roger Moore stuff. So I read the books in their sequence, seriously the best way, and by the time OHMSS came round, I had a pretty good idea of who James Bond was. And, I&apos;m sorry to inform all the Seanophiles, James Bond is not Connery, Moore, Dalton (though he came close, but is Welsh..)or Brosnan. Oddly enough, given the choices, he&apos;s kind of like George Lazenby.

Sure, Sean Connery was suave, sexy, and spoke rather curiously, Timothy Dalton had the serious side sorted, Brosnan is sophisticated etc, Roger Moore.. well, another time, maybe.

George Lazenby, maybe due to his lack of experience, (though why is his debut so widely mulled over in that respect.... it&apos;s not something that most actors are subjected to?) is not so at ease with his surroundings, not so cocksure that everything is going to work out fine as the others, and this is the real James Bond. The one in the books. You can almost believe in this one. And when things don&apos;t work out fine, you feel a weird familiarity with him. He&apos;s just a man, though admittedly he&apos;s disproportionately talented at a pretty impressive range of activities, from skiing to flying, swordsmanship, shooting people, jumping out of things, carnal endeavours etc.. Oh no, sorry, that&apos;s me. Well, anyway, I&apos;m quite tired now. OHMSS is the best of the films, though From Russia With Love contains possibly the finest fight scene of all and maybe the best trio of baddies (including a slightly peripatetic Blofeld)and is Connery&apos;s best.

George Lazenby is the best Bond, because his talents - a certain naturalistic charm, physical dexterity, and a capacity for possible failure - are used brilliantly, and he is closer by far than any of the others to the book-Bond.

There you go.

Oh, and Diana Rigg is the best &apos;Bond girl&apos;, though that description is not very fair to her, We Have All The Time In The World is the best Bond song, and the theme tune is possibly John Barry&apos;s finest work.. let alone being the best Bond title theme.

There you go again.

One Hour Photo,A mentally unstable photo developer targets an upper middle-class family after his obsession with them becomes more sick and disturbing than any of them could imagine.,"Robin Williams gives what may well be the performance of his career in `One Hour Photo,&apos; a creepy psychological thriller written and directed with cool precision by Mark Romanek. Given its premise, the film could easily have degenerated into a sordid, exploitative tale of obsession and madness. Instead, Romanek has chosen to take a more subtle approach, fashioning a film that downplays the potential violence of its material while, at the same time, recognizing the humanity of its central figure.

Romanek understands that the greatest threats to our safety and lives often come from the gray, nondescript people who surround us unnoticed, the `nobodies&apos; whose benign faces and vacuous smiles reveal no trace of the insanity, evil and potential for doing us harm that may be lurking right there under the surface. And nobody is `grayer&apos; than Si Parrish, an innocuous, socially undeveloped milquetoast who spends his days working as a photo developer in one of those sterile five-and-dime drug stores (just like the one in `The Good Girl&apos;) - and his nights sitting all alone in his drab apartment brooding over a massive family-photo shrine he has erected to the Yorkins, a seemingly happy family of three whose pictures Si has been developing, copying and obsessing over for more than seven years now. The film centers around Si&apos;s growing fixation with this one family and his delusional belief that he too could somehow become an integral part of their family unit. Then comes the day when Si realizes that he is no longer content to be a mere vicarious member of this adopted family and, thus, begins his plan to gradually insinuate himself more and more directly into their lives.

As both writer and director, Romanek manages to keep us in a state of vague uneasiness throughout. We are always anticipating some potentially dreadful event, yet Romanek doesn&apos;t go for the easy thrill or the obvious plot turn. Thanks to Williams&apos; subtle, incisive performance, we come to understand something of what makes this strange character tick. We begin to sense the deep-seated loneliness and social awkwardness that have come to play such an important part in defining both his behavior and his character. Si is scary, but he is also pathetic. He may have slipped over the edge into madness, but it is a pathology rooted in overwhelming loneliness and the inability to `fit in&apos; to the societal `norm&apos; of marriage and family. Even when his character is at his most threatening and irrational, Williams somehow makes us care about him. 

Romanek hits upon a few ancillary themes as well. He acknowledges how photos create the appearance of a life without necessarily reflecting the reality of that life. Most people, Si confesses, record only the `special, happy&apos; moments of their lives  birthdays, weddings, holidays etc. and leave out the mundane or painful ones. Moreover, Si tells us that people use pictures as a way of defeating aging and time, of saying to the world of the future that `I&apos;, this seemingly insignificant person, was really here, being happy and enjoying life. To match this theme, Romanek&apos;s visual style often feels like the director&apos;s own personal homage to The Photograph, as the camera scans caressingly across a sea of snapshots  and Si&apos;s voiceover narration complements that feeling.

`One Hour Photo&apos; is not a film for those who like their chills heavily laced with bloodshed, murder and mayhem. It is, rather, for those who can appreciate a quietly unsettling, yet strangely compassionate glimpse into the dark recesses of the troubled mind.",,"['Drama', 'Thriller']","['photography', 'photo lab', 'unfaithfulness', 'adultery', 'female rear nudity']",2002-09-13,['Mark Romanek'],"['Robin Williams', 'Connie Nielsen', 'Michael Vartan']",['Mark Romanek']

Onibaba,"Two women kill samurai and sell their belongings for a living. While one of them is having an affair with their neighbor, the other woman meets a mysterious samurai wearing a bizarre mask.","To describe this film in one word, that word would have to &apos;wow&apos;, or something to that effect. In short, Onibaba is an absolutely spectacular cinematic spectacle, and one that has few equals in it&apos;s field. In fact, it&apos;s the perfect fusion between art-house cinema and atmospheric horror! Loosely based on a Buddhist fable, Onibaba tells a story of lust, envy, wrath and betrayal which is wrapped up by way of a hideous demon mask. Onibaba is a human drama before it&apos;s a horror movie - all the character actions are driven by their various needs and wants, and the all the comeuppance emancipates from there. The characters and their actions are constantly fascinating, and it&apos;s that which predominantly keeps the film alive. We follow a mother and her daughter-in-law; a couple that are forced to eke out an existence in war torn Japan by killing passing samurai&apos;s and selling their belongings for food. Their existence is upset one day, however, when the son&apos;s friend, Hachi, returns from the war to the place where the two women live.

The title of the film roughly translates into English as &apos;demon woman&apos;, and that is an apt title for this story. Although the film doesn&apos;t contain any actual demons or other mythical creatures, the real horror comes from the character actions and the film succeeds as a horror film in that way. The atmospheric location, which consists of a huge area covered in reeds, adds weight to film&apos;s claim to the horror genre also and the location provides a truly stunning set for this story to take place. The film also features a dark pit, which the women use to dump the bodies of the Samurai they kill, which adds to the fantasy and inventive element of the story. The film is cinematic poetry on many levels, from the bleak yet beautiful cinematography, to the elements of the location mentioned - all the way down to it&apos;s central piece of imagery - the mask itself. The mask is the film&apos;s centrepiece, and the part&apos;s where it features are the most memorable of the movie.

Prolific Japanese director Kaneto Shindô takes us on a tour-de-force of atmospheric direction. He spends a fair amount of time focusing on the reeds blowing in the wind and many of his angles focus on the sky, which will no doubt irritate the less adept viewers amongst us - but the rest of us know that this is a way for Shindô to aptly portray his setting, and every instance when he did that was a delight for yours truly. There are many great shots in this movie, and if you&apos;re a fan of technical prowess, Onibaba is your film; and even if you&apos;re not, this film is a must see.",9,"['Drama', 'Horror', 'Thriller']","['mask', 'folk horror', 'grass', 'female serial killer', 'female protagonist']",1965-02-04,['Kaneto Shindô'],"['Nobuko Otowa', 'Jitsuko Yoshimura', 'Kei Satô']",['Kaneto Shindô']
Only Lovers Left Alive,"A depressed musician reunites with his lover. Though their romance, which has already endured several centuries, is disrupted by the arrival of her uncontrollable younger sister.","In a world of vampires, Adam (Tom Hiddleston) is a reclusive musician with a helper Ian (Anton Yelchin). Eve (Tilda Swinton) finds old friend Christopher Marlowe (John Hurt). Eve reconnects with Adam. They are both evolved beyond their bloodlust. They roam the deserted streets of Detroit. However they are interrupted by her wild little sister Ava (Mia Wasikowska).

It&apos;s an interesting take on the vampires. It&apos;s certainly a nice break from all the young adult vampire fares. It&apos;s got Jim Jarmusch&apos;s style of a slow deliberate indie. Tilda makes a great vampire. Tom Hiddleston fits quite nicely with Tilda. This is not a big studio churning out another vampire movie. It&apos;s moody. It has a few funny touches. It&apos;s outside the box. Mia doesn&apos;t come in until after halfway through the movie. The first half has this dreamy ethereal quality about it.

Now, when I saw the preview for the film, I was very intrigued. I wanted to know what happened, so I was shocked when one of my main movie theaters was playing it but then yet again, it&apos;s an indie theater. Now the whole set design of this film, was great. I thought it was something new to set it in India and it&apos;s a original idea. They actually payed respect to the culture. Now some of the jumpscares were annoying, but only some. They had great effects though for the &apos;gatekeeper&apos;, no CGI actual makeup. The performances were solid, the little girl wasn&apos;t atrocious, but she fitted her character well, nothing great, it&apos;s like she-just- acts-for-that-scene. Sarah Wayne Callies was much better than she needed to be, Jeremy Sisto was sort of just there, but he did well. The director tried to take this new approach to the film, which worked most of the time. It has old-classic scares like piano playing by itself, chairs moving, books falling, etc. Not really any new scares.

Made in County Kerry by a group of innovative amateurs, it was one of the first Irish films ever made. Telling a story of one family&apos;s involvement in the War of independence, the film explores some of the many themes that dominated the Irish psyche of the time - love of one&apos;s country, betrayal of one&apos;s heritage, and a relentless fight for freedom. Sure the script has its flaws, as does the acting and direction, but for an all amateur group working in unchartered territory this is a major accomplishment.

Greeley was pretty much the perfect place for this movie. There was a huge teen violence problem there. even at age 12 I carried a pistol and roamed the city at will with other kids fearing attack from gangs of older teens. Drugs were everywhere.

The movie captured all that stupidity plus the Apathy and ignorance of the adults. I loved the scenes where we rioted in the Circus tent styled John Evens Jr. High School......made it hard to attend class the following year.

Owning Mahowny,A bank manager with: (a) a gambling problem and (b) access to a multimillion dollar account gets into a messy situation. Based on the story of the largest one-man bank fraud in Canadian history.,"Interesting examination of a young Canadian bank executive who embezzles money to feed an insatiable gambling addiction.

Hoffman gives a yeoman&apos;s if not overly subdued performance as Dan Mahowny, and the film for the most part is a better than average watch. Strangely, the film plops you right into chapter 5 or thereabouts, and your left wondering who is this guy for the entire film. The motivation for Mahowny&apos;s odd behavior is never really broached. The film starts with Mahowny sports betting and playing for the usual small stakes, he then mysteriously falls off a cliff in his wagering amounts and we&apos;re supposed to swallow that it all stemmed off of a 10000 obligation? Then we&apos;re off to the races as he becomes this casino legend. Needed a little more development, and thats being kind. 

The direction is clever, in particular the ironic use of scenes showing the symbiotic relationship of bank and casino. On the nay side, the small budget generates the expected technical issues, most glaringly, never once providing camera-work that remotely convinces you he&apos;s in either Vegas or Atlantic City. The casino interior shots aren&apos;t properly done to eliminate the claustrophobic soundstagitis, and the only exterior shots found in the entire movie, are blatantly in Canada. As example, there is a scene where Mahowny is contemplating life while standing on the beach of the Atlantic Ocean. Its so obviously a lake or even pond and not the ocean, that its borderline embarrassing. Finally John Hurt, who i really like, is given liberty to really ham it overboard. But believe it or not, I genuinely like this film, and do recommend it.

Pacific Rim,"As a war between humankind and monstrous sea creatures wages on, a former pilot and a trainee are paired up to drive a seemingly obsolete special weapon in a desperate effort to save the world from the apocalypse.","Part of the reason I have started completely sitting out the summer blockbuster season is that I just got fed up going to crowded noisy cinemas to be disappointed by films that promised much but deliver just basic effects and little else. With Pacific Rim though, it is hard to feel this way because it is a film that has never pretended to be anything other than a Japanese inspired monster movie where big robots hit big aliens in a way that pretty much never makes much sense when you think about it. The plot is explained very quickly at the start of the film and we then jump into the future where the war we just learned about is reaching a peak. From here we have some doubt, some lessons to learn, barriers to overcome but really what we have are big special effects punching each other. And it works.

It is easy to wring one&apos;s hands and say that blockbusters are the death of film, but all things have a place as long as they are done well and this is at least an honest and fun film. I say honest because it has no pretension to it – it is plain and simple a monster movie with a very big budget behind it. The effects are good, with good monster design and generally a sense of fun and energy to the deliver. Of course it is just effects hitting other effects but it works for what it is and at least does this well – unlike other films that would aspire to more but yet can&apos;t even do this with any skill. The action sequences are large and fun throughout and the soapy drama doesn&apos;t get in the way at all. The film is loaded with references which I mostly got – the voice of GLaDOS being my favorite one.

The cast are not particularly famous but it doesn&apos;t matter since the effects are the stars here. That said I thought they did a good job, in particular I enjoyed seeing Elba, Day, Collins, Kikuchi and others in their various roles. Del Toro continues his love of all things geeky with this film and in terms of direction it looks good, with plenty going on but never not being clear and engaging.

It isn&apos;t a brilliant film by any means but it is a straightforward one that is honest with the viewer. Robots punching monsters – that is all that is promised and on that it very much delivers.

Bad things start to happen when some sheep start showing up in bloody lumps and a bank manager threatens to foreclose on their house. We learn that the dogs that are killing the sheep also have a taste for more civilized flesh. This is a fairly standard stalk & slash, ramped up a notch by good acting and some quite tense moments. The makeup effects from the dog attacks are quite convincing and had me flinch a couple times. Being taken down and eaten alive by wild dogs has got to be one of slowest and most painful deaths of nature. The pace of the movie is quite brisk, and it&apos;s set up for a possible sequel at the end, although I hope they just keep it at one.

Paper Moon,"During the Great Depression, a con man finds himself saddled with a young girl who may or may not be his daughter, and the two forge an unlikely partnership.","Paper Moon has to be one of the finest pieces of American cinema to grace the 70&apos;s. Bogdanovich&apos;s direction bares a strong resemblance to The Last Picture Show, but overall this film is much more satisfying and enjoyable. The Black and White photography gives the film a nostalgic beauty that perfectly complements the Depression-era it attempts to recreate. Also notable is the charming Jazz-based score, with a wonderful opening title track, reinforcing the film&apos;s charm. As good as the story, direction and music are however, the true stars of the film are the O&apos;Neal twosome. Both bring forth their best performances of their careers, and share a chemistry on screen that only a father and daughter could. Ryan O&apos;Neal brings forth a subtle charm as the wise-talking, but inept hustler Moses Pray. Tatum however, even upstages her father with what has to be the best youth performance in history. She is funny and moving when need be, and always charming, eliciting laughs many times based solely on her malleable facial expressions. Her show-stopping five minute shot, no matter how long it took to film, proves just how fully Tatum was able to embody little Addie Pray. The movie is always entertaining, with never a dull spot, with a strong supporting performance by Madeline Kahn to help keep things rolling during the middle. This is a true classic that should be seen by people of all ages, I can&apos;t recommend it enough!",10,"['Comedy', 'Crime', 'Drama']","['con man', 'great depression', 'little girl', 'amusement park', 'girl dresses as a boy']",1973-05-09,['Peter Bogdanovich'],"['Ryan O&apos;Neal', 'Tatum O&apos;Neal', 'Madeline Kahn']","['Joe David Brown', 'Alvin Sargent']"

The Paradine Case,A happily married London barrister falls in love with the accused poisoner he is defending.,"I liked this one, even though most people don&apos;t. It&apos;s a fascinating tale, and it seems very much Hitchcockian. Sure, it seems to drag at times, but the plot, directing, and the acting is good.

The Party,A clerical mistake results in a bumbling Indian film star being invited to an exclusive Hollywood party instead of being fired.,This film has to be regarded as a hilarious one-man-act by Peter Sellers.

The supporting cast perform adequately but Peter Sellers does all the work. He is simply one of the all-time greatest masters of great comedy timing. I was surprised to read so many negative comments on this site in association with this film. I can only surmise that they have come from a younger generation who have had their sense of humour surgically removed due to a force fed diet of unamusing US sitcoms.

La passion de Jeanne d&apos;Arc,"In 1431, Jeanne d&apos;Arc is placed on trial on charges of heresy. The ecclesiastical jurists attempt to force Jeanne to recant her claims of holy visions.","This film almost leads one to believe that sound betrays the emotion the eyes capture. Just as the blind develop hearing far better than the average, the deaf develop a keen sense of sight. I am convinced that a lack of dialogue forces us to read the language of the face and body, a verbage unmatched in beauty and nuance. Though the accompanying musical piece (be careful not to identify it as a score), so deliciously inspired by the film, enhances the visual playground; it is the actors&apos; faces that comprise this tour de force. Ms. Falconetti shifts from worry and doubt to unabashed conviction in a single shot, giving the viewer the luck of seeing one&apos;s thoughts in progress. She needs no response to the interrogation, it&apos;s all in her face. Renee is not superficially beautiful and the lack of make-up only reinforces how bare Joan is, but it is the uncanny ability of an incomparable stage actor to be a window into the soul that makes her so stunning, for the soul we see is one we only wish to attain for ourselves. The Church sees what we see, and they respond just as clearly to her unspoken protest with vehement pomp. The cinematography is so astounding for its time no comment could ever do it justice. Though many comments can be made, and are, surrounding the inspiration and detail for the set, it is at its core an incredible gift from Dreyer to the actors meant to inspire. It plays little part in the film, but to pull an inconceivable last drop of reality from the actors. A testament I can imagine will never be matched to the incredible power of silence.",,"['Biography', 'Drama', 'History']","['trial', 'close up scene', 'teenage girl', 'restored film', 'breast feeding']",1928-10-25,['Carl Theodor Dreyer'],"['Maria Falconetti', 'Eugene Silvain', 'André Berley']","['Joseph Delteil', 'Carl Theodor Dreyer']"
Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid,Pat Garrett is hired as a lawman on behalf of a group of wealthy New Mexico cattle barons to bring down his old friend Billy the Kid.,"Like the OK Corral gunfight and the saga of Jesse James, Pat Garrett & Billy The Kid has entered our national mythology and every generation is compelled to have it retold. James Coburn and Kris Kristofferson play the title roles in this epic western from Sam Peckinpah who curiously enough did not turn this into one of his violence ballets like The Wild Bunch.

No new facts are uncovered,no new ground is broken here. Former saddlemates Coburn and Kristofferson have parted. In the recent Lincoln County War they were together in the employ of John Chisum played here by Barry Sullivan fighting the Santa Fe Ring. That war is over, for cinematic reference see Chisum and the first Young Guns movie. But Billy won&apos;t leave his outlaw ways.

Just like soldiers in a war and remember this was the Lincoln County War as the state saw it and the locals called it, when peace breaks out soldiers who&apos;ve learned violent ways as mercenaries now have those skills and little else. So one either goes into law enforcement or outlawry.

Which are the divergent paths that these former friends have taken. Coburn has now the duty to bring in his former saddle pal however, a mandate that comes from Lew Wallace the Territorial Governor of New Mexico and author of Ben-Hur played here by Jason Robards, Jr. It doesn&apos;t look good for Kristofferson as a lot of hands are raised against him now.

One of my favorite lines from film comes from a John Wayne western Tall In The Saddle where Gabby Hayes says he&apos;s all for law and order &apos;depending on who&apos;s dishing it out&apos;. I think there is so much truth to that. In fact it could be Billy The Kid&apos;s creed in this film.

Sam Peckinpah did a wonderful job in telling this tale once again for the big screen. Also nice to see such stalwart western faces as Chill Wills and Jack Elam. And R.G. Armstrong is wonderful as the self righteous deputy sheriff who Kristofferson blasts into the next world.

Paths of Glory,"After refusing to attack an enemy position, a general accuses the soldiers of cowardice and their commanding officer must defend them.","Paths of Glory (1956) 

**** (out of 4) 

Stanley Kubrick&apos;s masterpiece anti-war drama centers on a Colonel (Kirk Douglas) who led a group of soldiers on a suicide mission but when the troops refuse to leave the trenches, three of them are hand picked to be executed on grounds of cowardice. I think sometimes it&apos;s easy to forget the pure genius of Kubrick and to me this was the first of many masterpieces that he&apos;d deliver throughout his career. On a technical level this film is flawless from start to finish and this is certainly one of the greatest movies in its genre. There are so many brilliant scenes here that it&apos;s really shocking that such a young and fresh director could come off with something like this. There are many memorable scenes in the film but I suppose to most famous ones are the tracking shots following various men inside the trenches. Kubrick keeps the camera in front of the men and tracks them as they walk and the atmosphere this effect brings to the screen hasn&apos;t been matched from any war film that I&apos;ve seen. This technique really builds a strange and claustrophobic nature that puts you right there in the action and gives you a sense of how tight these quarters are. The actual battle scene is also quite beautiful because it really doesn&apos;t center on any one piece of the action going on. Instead the camera just floats as the men try to capture their target and the swooping camera really gives you a bigger feeling of the battle. This scene comes off remarkably well considering the budget Kubrick was working with. The film is incredibly powerful with its messages on war and humans and all of this comes together beautifully in the finale, which is very haunting and touching. I think what made Kubrick a genius of his craft was the fact that he had a lot of guts and it&apos;s easy to see this with the ending, which doesn&apos;t end in a typical way. The final song was something very tricky to pull off yet Kubrick does so wonderfully well and really hits a home run with the message. Finally, the film contains some of the greatest acting you&apos;re going to see in the film with Douglas leading the way as the Col. who then must turn defender to try and keep the three men alive. The restraint nature Douglas shows perfectly fits the character but when his rage finally explodes, there&apos;s really no one better at doing this type of acting. George Macredy really steals the film as the General who wants the men executed and really becomes one of the most hated villains in film history.",,"['Drama', 'War']","['trench warfare', 'military officer', 'courtroom', 'rifle', 'world war one']",1957-12-25,['Stanley Kubrick'],"['Kirk Douglas', 'Ralph Meeker', 'Adolphe Menjou']","['Stanley Kubrick', 'Calder Willingham', 'Jim Thompson']"

Peeping Tom,"A young man murders women, using a movie camera to film their dying expressions of terror.","The film that did a large amount of damage to Michael Powell&apos;s film career remains as a prime example of an intellectual British horror film. It has certainly retained the power to shock over four decades later, and leaves the viewer with more questions than have been answered during the fairly short running time.

Carl Boehm plays Mark Lewis, a focus puller at a film studio who feeds his voyeuristic tendencies by filming people everyone he goes. This preoccupation takes a disturbing twist in his need to kill, and film women as he kills them. So far, so unsavoury. Mark appears on the surface as a personable young man who just has this dangerous, psychotic tendency he can&apos;t always keep in check. The audience is thus invited to have some sympathy with him, especially after the discovery that the young Mark was the focus for his father&apos;s experiments on the nature of fear in children (show in part as the film within the film featuring Michael Powell and his son Columba), and was filmed and recorded for the whole of his young life. No wonder, the film is saying, that he has grown into this disturbed person who has no real life away from either recording things on a camera, or watching the results in his darkened room.

Anna Massey has perhaps the prime female role in the film, as Mark&apos;s downstairs neighbour Helen Stephens. She is both repelled and attracted by Mark&apos;s movie-making, and perhaps she is closer to him that she would herself admit. It is a restrained performance of considerable power. Moira Shearer has a brief appearance as the studio stand-in who becomes his victim, while Shirley Anne Field provides light relief as the film actress who can never get her lines right and doesn&apos;t know how to faint on camera.

Peeping Tom&apos; is a clever piece of work which perhaps came too soon to be acceptable to the establishment. After all, during Powell&apos;s collaborations with Emeric Pressburger, they often pushed their luck with their subject matter and the way they presented it. This film was the natural progression of that anarchistic spirit. It is humorous in places  Mark is not presented as a one-dimensional monster  while being a very dark and disturbing psychological thriller throughout.",,"['Drama', 'Horror', 'Thriller']","['serial killer', 'filmmaking', 'voyeurism', 'pornography', 'peeping tom']",1960-05-16,['Michael Powell'],"['Karlheinz Böhm', 'Anna Massey', 'Moira Shearer']",['Leo Marks']

Penelope is an original and uplifting story that reminds us of life&apos;s most fundamental truth -- that our beliefs lock us into a particular reality. It is packed full of excitement, surprises, laughs, heartfelt pangs and soaring joy. Christina Ricci is radiant as Penelope and in the face of daunting circumstances she inspires us to not only persevere but to dare to break free. It is a treat to see Reese Witherspoon portraying an edgier gal than norm and James McAvoy is a heartthrob! Oh, and the performance of Simon Woods is absolutely delightful and unforgettable! This movie is important, but I would give away the ending if I told you why!!",10,"['Comedy', 'Fantasy', 'Romance']","['bee costume', 'pig', 'suicide', 'aristocrat', 'magical realism']",2008-02-29,['Mark Palansky'],"['Christina Ricci', 'James McAvoy', 'Reese Witherspoon']",['Leslie Caveny']
Pennies from Heaven,"During the Great Depression, a sheet-music salesman seeks to escape his dreary life through popular music and a love affair with an innocent schoolteacher.","If you are truly interested in seeing this film, please read the review written by Pauline Kael, who with her unique voice, says everything I am about to try to say, perfectly. This may not be a movie for everybody. First, you may have to have some patience for musicals. And secondly, you may have to have patience for complex people and their problems. I have watched this movie with two friends, and the first yawned everytime the actors opened their mouths to lip sync the beautiful and strange Depression era songs. The second found the role played by Steve Martin heartbreaking, and could not watch the entire film. But I think this movie can be extremely rewarding, and have found myself watching it a least once a year for the past few years. I think the Depression makes an excellent back round in this bittersweet story of blind optimism, and this movie greatly inspires my imagination. I imagine the whole U.S. as it was in the early part of the century, filled with millions of dreamers, greedy for sex and love and money, just like people are now, only now most people have a shot at a least one of those things, and during the depression, beautiful and hopelessly empty dreams were everywhere, as poverty crushed lives right and left. Steve Martin and Bernadette Peters are as connected and magical together as they are in the Jerk. In fact, everything I love about The Jerk is what I love about Pennies From Heaven. Some of the musical sequences are breathtaking, particularly a dance number performed by Christopher Walken ! And the subtle beauty of the last song sung by Steve Martin, I don&apos;t know how to describe it. In closing, this movie is not for everybody. But I know I am not the only person out there who will see this movie as the unique gift that it is. Please give it a shot.",,"['Drama', 'Musical', 'Romance']","['police', 'vengeful wife', 'blinking light', 'movie theater', 'finger snap']",1982-01-01,['Herbert Ross'],"['Steve Martin', 'Bernadette Peters', 'Jessica Harper']",['Dennis Potter']

The Perks of Being a Wallflower,An introvert freshman is taken under the wings of two seniors who welcome him to the real world.,"I absolutely loved this film - specifically the acting, music and even at times the cinematography. Steven Chbosky captured the spirit of the book and the characters magnificently - Ezra and Logan give exceptional performances that deserve major credit. Emma gives a strong performance as Sam - you can tell that she really understands the character, however she does struggle a bit with the American accent. Not to worry - she&apos;s in Bling Ring next year and will have improved by then, she does a great job of finding her ground and portraying a troubled yet lovable and wonderful teen, at times her actions speak much louder than her words. Logan is phenomenal at every aspect of Charlie - awkward, unsure, emotional, honest - he gives an amazing performance. Ezra is hilarious but not gimmicky, and can flip to a somber tone at a moment&apos;s notice and have everyone spellbound. Also great performances from Mae Whitman, Nina Dobrev and Johnny Simmons. The young cast is truly the heart of the film and are all really great. There is a lot of humour, emotion, honesty, everything it needed, and also an excellent soundtrack to back it up.",10,['Drama'],"['coming of age', 'high school', 'first love', 'introvert', 'gay']",2012-10-12,['Stephen Chbosky'],"['Logan Lerman', 'Emma Watson', 'Ezra Miller']",['Stephen Chbosky']
Personal Best,"The intertwined lives and loves of three highly ranked athletes striving for the national team; Chris bounces between the beds of male coach Terry and her female friend, competitor, and role model Tory.","Although it has been many years since I saw this film it stands out as being an excellent film, both in the content-human relationships & competition, as well as the cinematography.

Mariel Hemingway is simply stunning. Indeed the Women&apos;s High Jump is among the best events to watch at any Track & Field meet-as the girls are generally young, long & lean.

If you follow T & F some of the high jumpers are able to compete at the highest level for over a decade. (I think that 5 of the top 8 of the 1988 Seoul Olympics had also made the final of the 1976 Olympics).

There were two good films that I know of that had aim as 80 Olympics-Golden Girl with Susan Anton & this film. So how long did the USSR stay in Afganistan after the 1980 Olympic boycott? 13 years. So if a politician says a sporting team should boycott another country because of civil rights etc-then remind them of this Olympics, which in turn stuffed up the next Olympics as well as a couple of Commonwealth Games especially for African countries.

Irony Idi Amin pulled Uganda out of the 1976 Olympics because New Zealand played rugby in South Africa.

Even in 2004 the Aust govt was sort of trying to stop the Aust Cricket team from touring Zimbabwe.

Enough of politics as I was not really aware of politics when I saw Personal Best in the early 1980&apos;s. I was aware of my attraction to girls and in Mariel there is one of the most beautiful as well as the capacity to admire athletic bodies , male & female, both on the track and in the locker room.",,"['Drama', 'Sport']","['female athlete', 'female nudity', 'pentathlon', 'coach athlete relationship', 'track and field']",1982-06-26,['Robert Towne'],"['Mariel Hemingway', 'Scott Glenn', 'Patrice Donnelly']",['Robert Towne']
Pet Sematary,"After tragedy strikes, a grieving father discovers an ancient burial ground behind his home with the power to raise the dead.","In the trivia section for Pet Sematary, it mentions that George Romero (director of two Stephen King stories, Creepshow and The Dark Half) was set to direct and then pulled out. One wonders what he would&apos;ve brought to the film, as the director Mary Lambert, while not really a bad director, doesn&apos;t really bring that much imagination to this adaptation of King&apos;s novel, of which he wrote the screenplay. There are of course some very effective, grotesquely surreal scenes (mainly involving the sister Zelda, likely more of a creep-out for kids if they see the film), and the casting in some of the roles is dead-perfect. But something feels missing at times, some sort of style that could correspond with the unmistakably King-like atmosphere, which is in this case about as morbid as you&apos;re going to get without incestuous cannibals rising from the graves being thrown in (who knows if he&apos;ll save that for his final novel...) 

As mentioned though, some of the casting is terrific, notably Miko Hughes as Gage Creed, the little boy who goes from being one of the cutest little kids this side of an 80&apos;s horror movie, to being a little monster (I say that as a compliment, of course, especially in scenes brandishing a certain scalpel). And there is also a juicy supporting role for Fred Gwynne of the Munsters, who plays this old, secretive man with the right notes of under-playing and doom in tone. And applause goes to whomever did the make-up on Andrew Hubatsek. But there are some other flaws though in the other casting; Dale Midkiff is good, not great, as the conflicted, disturbed father figure Creed, and his daughter Ellie is played by an actress that just didn&apos;t work for me at all.

In terms of setting up some chilling set-pieces, only a couple really stand-out: a certain plot-thickening moment (not to spoil, it does involve a cool Ramones song), and the first visit to the pet sematary (the bigger one), including the sort of mystical overtones King had in the Shining. For the most part it&apos;s a very polished directing job, though it could&apos;ve been made even darker to correspond with the script. If thought out in logical terms (albeit in King terms) it is really one of his more effective works of the period. But it doesn&apos;t add up like it could, or should. Still, it makes for a nifty little midnight movie.",7,"['Fantasy', 'Horror', 'Thriller']","['intentionally misspelled title', 'neighbor', 'indian burial ground', 'house fire', 'woods']",1989-04-21,['Mary Lambert'],"['Dale Midkiff', 'Denise Crosby', 'Fred Gwynne']",['Stephen King']
The Petrified Forest,"A waitress, a hobo and a bank robber get mixed up at a lonely diner in the desert.","Robert Sherwood&apos;s The Petrified Forest had a run in 1935 on Broadway for the first half of that year. Warner Brothers bought the film rights and shot it the following year. Leslie Howard and at his insistence, Humphrey Bogart, came west to repeat their stage roles.

For Bogart it was a return to bigger acclaim than he had gotten in his first trip to Hollywood in the early Thirties. He hadn&apos;t made much of an impression then, but he was in Tinseltown to stay after The Petrified Forest and his frightening characterization of criminal on the run, Duke Mantee.

The Petrified Forest takes place in a filling station/greasy spoon truck stop on the edge of the Arizona desert. About as desolate a place as you&apos;ll find. Three generations of the Maple family own and operate the place. Grandpa Charley Grapewin, Father Porter Hall, and daughter Bette Davis who dreams about the fact there&apos;s more to life than this nowhere place. Bette also has to contend with former college football star Dick Foran and his clumsy efforts at courtship.

Along comes Alan Squier played by Leslie Howard who&apos;s a blase world weary vagabond who&apos;s seen better days. He and Davis hit it off and she comes to realize that there is a great big world out there. 

The first third of the movie involves the two of them and I have to say that in the mouths of players less skilled than these two, Robert Sherwood&apos;s dialog would have sounded like so much romantic drivel.

For Davis, Gabrielle Maple is a unique part and not one she&apos;d play later on as her features hardened. An intelligent and romantic young girl is not a typical Bette Davis part, but she does bring it off.

As for Howard, Alan Squier is a typical part for him. Not too much different than Ashley Wilkes or Philip Scott from The 49th Parallel.

The remainder of the film is when Duke Mantee and his gang take refuge at the filling station and hold captive anyone who&apos;s there or wanders in. A lot of souls are bared under Mantee&apos;s guns and the climax is spectacular.

Two other actors who repeated their Broadway roles are Joseph Alexander who&apos;s the chauffeur of a rich couple who stop at the filling station and Slim Thompson a member of Mantee&apos;s gang. Both of these players are black.

Joseph Alexander is a menial and Slim Thompson really rubs it in to him, telling him the day of liberation has come for some time now. In 1936 that was practically revolutionary.

Alexander had a substantial career, but I have no idea what happened to Thompson. He had no other film credits and only one other stage appearance on Broadway in the original production of Anna Lucasta.

Moviegoers of all generations should thank Leslie Howard for insisting on Humphrey Bogart being in this film and helping to create a screen legend.",9,"['Drama', 'Thriller']","['diner', 'drifter', 'artist', 'self destructiveness', 'love triangle']",1936-02-08,['Archie Mayo'],"['Leslie Howard', 'Humphrey Bogart', 'Bette Davis']","['Charles Kenyon', 'Delmer Daves', 'Robert E.

I cried when I saw this movie the first time, which was the day after my grandfather&apos;s death.

He once told me this was the first movie he ever saw, in a cinema, to which there was a 10 kilometers walk in the snow.

The plot of this film is that there&apos;s this boy named Milo. He leads a crappy life because he can&apos;t make up his mind about anything, when ever he&apos;s inside he longs to be out, and whenever he&apos;s outside he long&apos;s to in (that was from the book). Well one day he find&apos;s this strange box. In the box, there&apos;s a freaky tollbooth that talks. Then afterwards there&apos;s this car that shows up, he gets in the car and goes on his quest for happiness.

Fenómenas,Three middle-aged women who investigate paranormal events are put to the test when their leader Father Pilón disappears. Inspired by the real Hepta Group.,"This was quite an entertaining film. For the non Spanish people, the actors are comedians but do a great job as serious actors. There are some funny moments, especially within the dialogue which lightens the mood of the film.

Unfortunately, for me the ending was a little disappointing. The lead up to it was somewhat flat. There were incidents in the film which had to be questioned and really, why did they do this when it had nothing much to do with the story line.

All in all, the film was fun to watch. I enjoyed the characters (the three women) and it was also good to bring back the Hepta Group that was well known here years ago.",8,['Horror'],"['middle age', 'paranormal phenomenon', 'ghost', 'secret', 'paranormal investigator']",2023-04-14,['Carlos Therón'],"['Belén Rueda', 'Gracia Olayo', 'Toni Acosta']","['Marta Buchaca', 'Fernando Navarro']"
The Philadelphia Story,"When a rich woman&apos;s ex-husband and a tabloid-type reporter turn up just before her planned remarriage, she begins to learn the truth about herself.","This is a delightful romantic comedy about the life and loves of a high society girl. Tracy Lord (Katharine Hepburn) is about to be married to George Kittredge (John Howard), a self made man who elevated himself from the lower class. The wedding is supposed to be a private affair, but Tracy&apos;s ex-husband C.K. Dexter Haven (Cary Grant) blackmails her into letting two reporters, Macaulay Conner and Elizabeth Imbrie (James Stewart and Ruth Hussey) cover the event. What ensues is a screwball courtship for the heart of Tracy as everyone falls in love with her at once.

Director David Cukor (`Little Women&apos;, `My Fair Lady&apos;) provides a fast paced comedy with rapid-fire repartee and fosters a bubbly chemistry between the cast members, which brims with laughs. Cukor received one of his five Oscar nominations for this film and it was well deserved.

Katharine Hepburn is marvelous as the blueblood bride to be. She is a well-grounded girl who is not beyond putting on airs for show. She is simultaneously sassy and dreamy and her comic timing is superb earning her one of twelve nominations for best actress. Despite a star&apos;s billing, Cary Grant plays a supporting role as the sarcastic Dexter Haven. With his deadpan delivery, he provides the perfect foil to Hepburn and Stewart.

Even with the luminous cast, Jimmy Stewart steals the show with a comedic tour de force. His inebriated scene with Cary Grant is uproariously funny and his puppy dog wooing of Katherine Hepburn is enchanting. It is hard to believe that James Stewart only won one Oscar in his outstanding career. Though nominated five times, the only role for which he won the statue is this one, a performance that is unquestionably among his best.

This tremendous comedy brings together three screen legends at the peak of their careers. It was nominated for six Academy Awards winning two, and it was rated #51 on AFI&apos;s top 100 of the century. It is a timeless classic that is sure to please. I rated it a 10/10.

The Picture of Dorian Gray,"A corrupt young man somehow keeps his youthful beauty, but a special painting gradually reveals his inner ugliness to all.","Based on a story by Oscar Wilde, The Picture of Dorian Gray tells the story of a man that sells his soul for eternal youth. After having his portrait done, Dorian Gray, under the influence of the eloquent Lord Henry Wotton, wishes for the picture to age instead of him so that he may be blessed with eternal youth. After the death of his wife-to-be, Dorian embarks on a life of pleasure and sins, which don&apos;t affect the man in the slightest, but leaves it mark on the portrait which descends into a horrid impression of the handsome young man it&apos;s portraying...

This film is fantastically well put together. The acting, directing and writing are all stellar, which make this film one pleasant viewing indeed. The real plaudits for this movie, however, go to the writer of the original novel; Oscar Wilde. The story itself is ingenious. Of course, the idea of selling one&apos;s soul had been done before (the German legend, Faust, springs to mind instantly), but never in this way. The portrait itself is a genius idea and it allows us to see the man and the sin as different things. However, through it&apos;s ending; it also allows the audience to see that the two are linked, and overall giving a good commentary on body, soul and sin. The story has obvious themes of vanity and the lust for eternal youth entwined within it, both of which are sins in themselves. The main character of Dorian Gray is a man that is a victim of influence, and we can feel for him in that way; but he&apos;s also an ugly sinner on the inside, making the audience hate him. This is a strange situation for an audience to be in, and in the end; all that&apos;s left for him is indifference.

The film moves slowly, but this is definitely to it&apos;s advantage as it allows us to get to know the characters, and if it wasn&apos;t for that the horror wouldn&apos;t be able to work as it needs our emotional impact to function. The horror in the story is rather subdued, but this is one of the most horrific tales ever told. I think most people will agree that this kind of horror - the brooding, personal kind - is much more horrifying than anything that men with knives and any amount of jumpy moments can muster.",9,"['Drama', 'Fantasy', 'Horror']","['1890s', 'painting', 'painter', 'soul', 'hedonist']",1945-03-03,['Albert Lewin'],"['George Sanders', 'Hurd Hatfield', 'Donna Reed']","['Albert Lewin', 'Oscar Wilde']"

Grabbing the viewers&apos; attention from the off, as every parent&apos;s nightmare is lived out in graphic detail at the close of a thirty minute escalation that lays the foundations for a bridge to the unimaginable, a trajectory paved with chaos, veiled and shrouded in turmoil, suspended on tenterhooks as tense and as taught as Tacoma. With anticipation and expectation set, it&apos;s a little disappointing to find this resonance, once established and secured soon decays and rapidly fades, from the deeps to the shallows, as the story begins to mainstream with its contemporaries, as opportunity, empathy and originality are lost and the only structure left standing embodied through the performance of Vanessa Kirby, who will surely go on to much bigger and better crossings.",7,['Drama'],"['grief', 'marriage', 'cemetery', 'sex', 'judge']",2021-01-07,['Kornél Mundruczó'],"['Vanessa Kirby', 'Shia LaBeouf', 'Ellen Burstyn']",['Kata Wéber']

Not everyone at the Festvial I watched this at, was as hyped about it as me though, but that&apos;s how everyone receives certain things.

Now onto the problems: There is not much happening in the movie. And while the direction it takes (concentrating on the characters) is not really a bad one, it doesn&apos;t have either the script/dialog nor the actors to carry something like that.

At many times, you can&apos;t understand what the actors are saying, and frequently the music covers what they&apos;re saying. I kept waiting for things to pick up, but the humor declined, until the final minute, which I give the directors a lot of credit for. To follow such a bad script and premise so long, and then throw the Hollywood ending in the toilet is brave. I just don&apos;t think very many viewers will wait that long for such a small payoff. Teenagers hoping for a lot of skin probably won&apos;t wait &apos;til the end for that payoff, either. Two chuckles and a pretty girl don&apos;t make up for everything that&apos;s wrong with this movie. If it were someone&apos;s student project, I&apos;d cut them some slack.

Pink Floyd: The Wall,A confined but troubled rock star descends into madness in the midst of his physical and social isolation from everyone.,"A film made in the 80&apos;s  for children of the 60&apos;s.

Pink Floyd&apos;s The Wall is arguably the best `rock opera&apos; ever.  But the angst and societal issues that the album addresses only seem aged now.

The film, by blending the original music plus skilful re-mixes and new tracks tells a simple story, but the imagery used is dark and disturbing and relates to the social issues of the time. The film was made when the fears expressed in the novel 1984 were still a threat, (as an aside, while the film was being made in England there was a political campaign comparing the then conservative government of M. Thatcher to the Orwellian fascist world of 1984.)

But, as much as I and other members of my generation can relate to this film, does it have a message for today&apos;s youth. I think that it definitely does. The issues today may be different from those of the late 70&apos;s, but, the sentiment and the dangers are the same. We have huge segments of alienated people, we have bigotry and hate, and we have governments which operate in secret. We have movements that preach rigid conformity and hate, we have religions that have lost the message of caring and we have schools that only want to turn out mindless corporate robots.

In fact, I think that this film, and therefore the message behind the music, is MORE important today. The issues we as a society face now are far more dangerous to personal freedoms than when it was first released.",7,"['Drama', 'Fantasy', 'Music']","['drugs', 'loss of father', 'cheating wife', 'alienation', 'suicidal thoughts']",1982-09-17,['Alan Parker'],"['Bob Geldof', 'Christine Hargreaves', 'James Laurenson']",['Roger Waters']

Piranha 3D,"After a sudden underwater tremor sets free scores of the prehistoric man-eating fish, an unlikely group of strangers must band together to stop themselves from becoming fish food for the area&apos;s new razor-toothed residents.","This film is a rather cheesy film, but sometimes a bit of cheese is a good thing. In fact, I enjoy cheese so to a point I enjoyed this film. It had some great gore in it and it was just a mindless movie where you shut off your brain and enjoy an hour and a half distraction. The film was a modest hit, making its budget back in the states and making an additional 55 million with its worldwide gross, but not a super hit by any stretch of the imagination. 

The story has a earthquake that unleashes an underwater cavern where there are apparently thousands upon thousands of flesh eating piranha residing. One would think that if these fish were living in an isolated cavern where food was not plentiful they would evolve needing less food, but like I said it is mindless fun as they come out hungry and their victims? A bunch of annoying teen spring breakers, so you are going to enjoy watching them get killed. A teen whose mom is a sheriff goes with this guy shooting a girls gone wild type video (why the heck were those things popular?) and we meet a few people before the fish go on their super kill spree!

The film features quite a number of actors such as Richard Dreyfuss who gets credited and I never really noticed him, then figured out he was the fisherman at the beginning of the film. Then there is Christopher Lloyd who was not listed in the credits, but who is in the film a lot more than Dreyfuss. Ving Rhames also plays a role in this one and there are a couple of others of note.

The story is slight but well told with stunning cinematography and a most impressive set, cleverly lit with colour tints, inspired perhaps by Mario Brava. Vincent Price has the time of his life, as impressive in close up as in medium. If he overdoes the old acting bit we love him for it because he does it so well. Certainly he makes most of the rest of the cast look a little wooden and we long for the arrival of Barbara Steele. Of course the wait is worth while but perhaps we could have had some flash backs early on in the film when we are gradually being let into the true horror of the situation.

The Plague Dogs,Two dogs escape from a laboratory and are hunted as possible carriers of the bubonic plague.,"Martin Rosen&apos;s second animated film is a powerful piece, which is based on Richard Adams novel of the same name. The Plague Dogs is a very rare example of a film in the animation genre which strives for realism in the grittiest of senses. As far away from fluffy Disney films as one could imagine, this is a disturbing account of the hardships of two dogs who escape from an animal testing lab. The perceived haven of the real world soon turns out to be anything like Rowf and Snitter had hoped. However the friendship that is built through out the film between the two dogs and a rogue fox whom they meet, is touching and at times heartbreaking. To delve much further into the story would be to spoil certain aspects of the film, so that shall be left down to the viewer to discover.

Suffice to say, the main strength of Plague Dogs is paradoxically the reason the film has found itself in obscurity. To this date the original, &apos;uncut&apos;, version has not been released on any small screen formats (not to my knowledge at least). This strength is the bravery with which Rosen tackles the story. Resulting from this is a down beat film that isn&apos;t suitable for, nor is it likely to interest most, children. This is more than likely the reason it never found the success of Rosen&apos;s previous feature, Watership Down. 

In short, this film deserves to be released in its full splendor and embraced by a whole new generation of film lovers. Anyone with a heart that isn&apos;t made of stone will get the appeal of this wonderful film.",10,"['Animation', 'Adventure', 'Drama']","['escape', 'dog', 'laboratory', 'research', 'adult animation']",1985-01-09,['Martin Rosen'],"['John Hurt', 'Christopher Benjamin', 'James Bolam']","['Richard Adams', 'Martin Rosen']"

Pollyanna,A young girl comes to an embittered town and confronts its attitude with her determination to see the best in life.,"It is well worth taking another look at POLLYANNA if you and your family have not seen it for a long time. You will be delighted to realize just how subversive this intelligent witty film is. In fact Pollyanna&apos;s surname IS Wittier. People who carp that this is a syrupy sweet film and moan about Disney saccharine movies are missing the point. POLLYANNA is a sly film about misuse of power, loneliness, bullying and meanness using a good natured teen to counterpoint a town of adults who have lost their way in their own lives. She has to be a strong opposite in order for each adult to have a revelation about their own unpleasant behavior. The key adult is her Aunt Polly who has not had sex for a long time, as a result she is bitter and bossy and all the town is afraid to stand up to her. Aunt Polly&apos;s sexual frustration is pointed out several times because, in a family film as sharp as this you can have very adult situations wrapped in gauze and acceptable as a character flaw. Pollyanna simply by being positive (and clever and funny) has a profound affect on everyone in need of re awakening. Pollyanna even takes on the hypocrisy of the church and the contents of the bible: One astonishing and powerful scene is in an open field on a very hot day with the church Pastor (a terrific Karl Malden) is practicing his latest fire and brimstone scare campaign. Pollyanna visits him and by being her intelligent self politely demolishes his mindset. He is found later by his wife collapsed with a overwhelming awareness of where he has been wrong. He then becomes a catalyst for motivating the town to stand up to Aunt Polly&apos;s sabotage of all their lives. What is so deliciously refreshing about POLLYANNA is that is it simple courtesy and commonsense from the mouth of a confident blossoming 13 year old girl (as &apos;the future&apos;) ...the milk mustache scene is completely THERE in mid screen for any slow learners. The direction is terrific and hilarious and there are many big laughs in small moments scattered through the film; Jimmy and the fish, Pollyanna imitating a cow chewing, the granny playing the drums, Pollyanna being handed sandwiches while hiding in a bush in the conservatory.... loads of crowd pleasing moments for a big audience of families to relish. Particularly moving is the whole subplot about the prisms of light. Agnes Moorehead has a hilarious turn as a hypochondriac who comes good and helps find Pollyanna a doll. Many many matching emotional moments all through this film. Adolph Menjou also has a great spot as the town scary man supposedly with a cellar full of slaves and rats. So take my advice and look for the wickedly funny jokes at the expanse of the status quo and have a wonderful time laughing and wiping tears with your kids and you embrace every magnificently produced sly comedy moment of this utterly clever heartwarming film. POLLYANNA is a complete success. Even vintage car enthusiast are included in the delighted audience for this film. The very funny opening scene of the naked boy swinging on a rope will alert you to the fact this is a film with a very wicked agenda. The production values of antiques costumes and gorgeous visuals are as lavish as MY FAIR LADY.

The Pom Pom Girls,"A group of carefree high school seniors are having the time of their lives, filled with sex, romance, and teen high jinks.","THE POM POM GIRLS was a huge sleeper hit in it&apos;s day and it&apos;s easy to see why. Thousands of stoned kids across the land with beer in hand at the drive-in, watching this documentary-like fun fest on being a high school kid in the mid-70&apos;s. What a wonderful life these kids have! Drive around drinking or high, get the girl, have sex where ever you want, and not worry about any diseases or repercussions whatsoever. And football. You get to play a lot of football.

I love this film. If you tried to make a movie like this today, you couldn&apos;t do it without some killjoy saying you couldn&apos;t have them drinking and driving. But kids do that. Some die and a majority don&apos;t. These kids are not repressed sexually. They are free to make love to whoever they choose and don&apos;t worry about death and condoms. They seem to be having fun and enjoying life, and that&apos;s why this film really couldn&apos;t be made today, because it shows people, teens especially, enjoying life in an innocent, yet rebellious, drug-addled, highly sexual way. Nobody dies, nobody gets hurt, and they do everything they were told they shouldn&apos;t do.

While the acting is definitely not the best, it is a cute movie and can be enjoyed whenever it is on TV. A fun movie is fun no matter how many times you see it.

While the film is nothing compared to the wonderful cartoons of the thirties through the fifties, Popeye creates a world like none other. We can relax and have fun with Popeye as he journeys with Ms. Duvall.

 A fun movie for all to watch. Recommended especially for the little ones.

What is true strength? To me one trait it is to be true to one&apos;s self even when it will not be acceptable and judged by others. Considering the time period that this film takes place in however being true to one&apos;s self could result in death.

Pride & Prejudice,"Sparks fly when spirited Elizabeth Bennet meets single, rich, and proud Mr. Darcy. But Mr. Darcy reluctantly finds himself falling in love with a woman beneath his class. Can each overcome their own pride and prejudice?","This quintessentially English film is utterly charming - a very traditional interpretation of Jane Austen&apos;s 1813 novel that manages to entertain, amuse and even move. First time director Joe Wright has worked with television playwright Deborah Moggach&apos;s script and a wonderful collection of mainly British actors to delight us. The versatile camera-work, luscious countryside, grand settings, period costumes, and atmospheric music are evidence of a work on which much love has been lavished.

At the heart of this triumph is the delightful 20 year old Keira Knightley as the assured and sharp Elizabeth Bennett, the second of five daughters looking to be married off by an anxious mother. Knightley&apos;s rise in the thespian firmament has been meteoric and this is her best performance to date in a role for which she is perfectly cast. Matthew MacFadyen is suitably brooding and gauche as Mr Darcy, but the cast list is enlivened with splendid British character actors, including Brenda Blethyn as Lizzie&apos;s irascible mother, Tom Hollander as a diminutive cleric seeking a wife, and Judi Dench as the formidable Lady Catherine, plus the Canadian Donald Sutherland (Lizzie&apos;s wise father).

This is a Georgian world in which social conventions present a veritable minefield for indiscretions or misunderstandings and in which a formal dance can be as intricate an occasion as international diplomacy. Pride and prejudice are only two of the obstacles to be overcome before inevitably true love brings Lizzie and her dark knight nose to nose (we don&apos;t even see a kiss).

Primal Fear,"An altar boy is accused of murdering a priest, and the truth is buried several layers deep.","Martin (Richard Gere) is a very successful attorney in the Chicago area. However, his workaholic and limelight-seeking tendencies ruined one relationship with an underling (Laura Linney). Now comes the case of all cases. The archbishop of Chicago has been brutally murdered and the suspect is an innocent looking vagrant named Aaron (Edward Norton). Martin decrees that he MUST represent Aaron so he offers the young man his services pro bono, knowing the publicity for the trial will place them both squarely in the news for weeks and weeks. Yet, there is much evidence against Aaron. Despite his stuttering and guiltless demeanor, is Aaron truly not the killer? And, what is more important, justice or winning a case? This is a great, great movie, in many diverse ways. First, the performances are outstanding, with Gere giving a fine turn as the hotshot lawyer and Norton truly jawdropping as the murder suspect who looks like a choirboy. Linney does a nice turn as the district attorney and the other cast members are very well chosen, too. The Chicago setting shows the place as it is, a mixture of both wealthy and dismally poor neighborhoods. Costumes, especially Gere&apos;s lawyer garb, are very nice. Then, too, the script, based on a novel by William Diehl, is first rate and full of twists and turns, with a stunning maneuver at the finale. There are a few brief scenes of graphic violence, as the murder itself comes quite near the film&apos;s beginning, so there may be moments when you need to look away from the screen, if you are a bit squeamish. Also, if you are Catholic, there may be some parts of the story that are a bit offensive. But, all in all, if you love Gere or you long for interesting, intelligent thrillers, you should not miss Primal Fear.

Watch for the magnificent and subtle flying insects throughout the film, especially in the ancient forest, where bioluminescent dragonflies glide gently around the screen. There are thousands of subtleties such as this. You&apos;d have to see it a dozen times to appreciate this film fully. Aside from it being the most beautiful film I&apos;ve ever seen, it also has an enormously powerful script. The characters are some of the the most well rounded in all film. Ashitaka especially, the main character of the film, is so nuanced that he has become in my mind one of the great characters in film, up there with Charles Foster Kane and Jake LaMotta. I would compare him to Freder, the main character of Fritz Lang&apos;s Metropolis. His role in the film is a mediator between the forces of humans and the gods of nature. Both sides comment several times that Ashitaka must be on the other side, when he is trying desperately to convince everyone that there are no sides. Peace is the way. There is a little to be desired in the American voice talent. Claire Daines was certainly a wrong choice for San (Princess Mononoke), and Billy Bob Thornton just could not hide his southern accent, which made the character of Jigo seem more comical than he was probably supposed to be. Gillian Anderson&apos;s voice clashed with her character, the wolf god Moro, a bit. It hardly affected my passion. The film was so spectacular and beautiful that James Earl Jones could have voiced San and it would have detracted little. Definitely, though, I&apos;m praying that they release the DVD with subtitle options. Anyway, Princess Mononoke is the best film of 1999, the best film of the 1990&apos;s, and, in my personal top ten list, no lower than #5, but closer to #2. 12 hours later and my heart is still beating with the power of Princess Mononoke!

Prisoners of the Lost Universe,"Three people are transported into a parallel reality, where they find they must use modern technology, but medieval weapons, in order to save the citizenry from a murderous warlord.","The production team behind this sword and sorcery movie come with a fair amount of baggage . Director Terry Marcel and producer Harry Robertson had previously made HAWK THE SLAYER a film so bad that it almost attracted a cult following , almost . Certainly HAWK is a memorable film but not in any good way and Marcel and Robertson continue in the same vein here 

PRISONERS OF THE LOST UNIVERSE is another sword and sorcery film where modern day protagonists from the 20th Century , a TV presenter called Carrie and a truck driver called Dan find themselves transported to an alternative universe that sees different medieval tribes warring against one another with the upper hand being held by a tyrant called Kleel 

If the above makes you fear you&apos;re going to be watching a nonsensical movie then you&apos;d be right . That said it&apos;s also a movie that doesn&apos;t take itself entirely serious . I was somewhat surprised as to how involving some of the film is and didn&apos;t find myself continually wishing for it to finish despite never once thinking it was ever in danger of being a good movie .

A Private Function,"In post-World War II Britain, food rationing continues, leading a married couple to become involved in the flourishing bacon black market.","A near classic; like something Ealing might have done if, perhaps, raunchier though not necessarily darker. Set at the time of the present Queen Elizabeth&apos;s wedding to Prince Phillip, it&apos;s about the petty jealousies of the ostensible middle-classes of Northern ration-book Britain.

Michael Palin is Gilbert, a mild-mannered chiropodist, looked down upon, in all senses, by the local community who finds his trump card and way into society in the form of a pig that is being fattened for the private function of the title, a dinner for local dignitaries in celebration of the royal wedding. Maggie Smith is his genteel wife who turns into Lady MacBeth in pursuit of her dreams of fitting in and that great character actress Liz Smith is her slightly dotty mother.

Private Resort,"The story of two adolescent boys who are guests at a Florida resort for the week-end.

This is in fact the best spring break comedy of the 80&apos;s. However, that means it is the best of the 4 or 5 spring break comedies that came out between 1983-1985, really the only two years of the 1980&apos;s that had spring break comedies. Therefore, I&apos;m talking about movies like Spring Break, Where the Boys Are, Hot Resort, and Fraternity Vacation, so which also means this is pretty much just a sex comedy. Of all these, Private Resort is by far and away the best one. It follows two young guys, Depp and Morrow, who are just looking to get laid and in the meantime get in trouble with hotel security, Andrew Dice Clay, and Hector Elizondo before his Chicago Hope days. Also, not to mention the beautiful girls throughout the movie, but what else do you expect? As a result, this is a truly underrated sex comedy, but don&apos;t bother to watch it on Comedy Central, because like Casino and Goodfellas, it has to be seen uncut. **+ out of ****

There&apos;s a fantastic blend of European and Australian sensibilities here that makes this the least clichéd film to come out of this country for 20-odd years - and if it doesn&apos;t do well, it&apos;ll be because an increasingly soft and gutless nation is afraid to venture out of their frappuccino and mortgage comfort zone.

The Prowler,"An unknown killer, clad in World War II U.S. Army fatigues, stalks a small New Jersey town bent on reliving a 35 year-old double murder by focusing on a group of college kids holding an annual graduation dance.","The Prowler is an overlooked horror film from that golden age of slasher films of the late 70s and early 80s. The film is directed by Joseph Zito who has special effects wizard Tom Savini to thank for the film&apos;s best scenes. The two also teamed up for Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter (part 4), and that film is a superior effort to this one.

The Plot of this film is very similar to My Bloody Valentine. We have a brutal act of violence taking place many years ago. We have the first big social event scheduled in several years on the very grounds where the trouble took place. And we have a spooky killer chopping up victims left and right. Only instead of full mining gear, our Prowler is dressed in WWII era military fatigues.

The gore is by far the best thing this film has going for it. There are some DISGUSTING killings which look very much like they could be the real thing. Our killer loves to use his bayonet, a pitchfork, and a sawed-off double barrel shotgun on his victims. Most of the killings in the version I have are not mere snippets of knives piercing flesh. You see the killer slice and penetrate these victims until they aren&apos;t breathing any more. There is a tidal wave of blood spilled in this film. They saved the best for last, when we see just what a blast from a shotgun at point blank range can do to someone&apos;s face. (I would not dream of revealing the victim&apos;s identity here!) The film has some glaring dead spots, too. Lawrence Tierney who is billed pretty highly makes such a short appearance you wouldn&apos;t believe it. Character development is nearly non-existent, and the motivation behind the carnage is not defined by any logical means. Let me put it this way; I have absolutely NO IDEA why the killer committed these murders. I wonder if the writers even knew.

Gore fans will definitely need to see the uncut version of this film at some point in their lives. It&apos;s like a golfer having to play a certain course he heard is interesting before he dies or a skier having to try a certain slope. That kind of thing. See this film out of a sense of duty, but don&apos;t expect a true classic.

Psycho,"A Phoenix secretary embezzles $40,000 from her employer&apos;s client, goes on the run and checks into a remote motel run by a young man under the domination of his mother.","Most modern-day horror films make the killer to be an absolutely inhuman, grotesque, unimaginable monster in order to scare the audience out of its wits. Most of the time, however, these stereotypes create a generic murderer a raving, ranting, clearly demented psychopath. One of the few memorable cinematic killers that does not adhere to these restraints and cliches is, of course, Anthony Hopkins&apos; Hannibal Lecter, whom manages to effectively cause the audience to recoil without such drek as the aforementioned devices.

Anthony Perkins&apos; skillfully crafts his performance as Norman Bates, avoiding a ranting, raving, drooling, murder-happy, manic characterization; instead his performance as Norman is subtle, creepy, cool, and unsettling. He is brilliant; from his quiet conversations with Marion Crane amidst the stuffed birds, to his weasling wimpiness when confronted by Arbogast, his performance is so exact that it chills the viewer, all without the unnecessary disturbing images prevalent in more modern films (read The Cell, Henry: Portrait of A Serial Killer).

Perkin&apos;s fine performance, a tight script, and Bernstein&apos;s classic score make Psycho a film that is now and will always be remembered as one of the pinnacles of the horror genre.",9,"['Horror', 'Mystery', 'Thriller']","['motel', 'shower', 'stabbed with a knife', 'money', 'maniac']",1960-09-08,['Alfred Hitchcock'],"['Anthony Perkins', 'Janet Leigh', 'Vera Miles']","['Joseph Stefano', 'Robert Bloch']"

Pumpkinhead,"After a tragic accident, a man conjures up a towering, vengeful demon called Pumpkinhead to destroy a group of unsuspecting teenagers.","This film stands as one of the most underrated I have seen. It has a compelling story of a father&apos;s love and the powerful grip of vengeful desires. It is well acted, has amazing creature affects, and takes the road less traveled by most horror films. It takes no easy ways out. The plot prefers to turn slowly into a gnarled tale of battling with an inner demon.

Dollman vs. Demonic Toys,Judith Grey teams with Brick Bardo (Dollman) and his girlfriend Ginger to face the evil Demonic Toys for one final battle.,"First off, I am a fan of the full moon films from the early and mid 90&apos;s. So it was cool to see a mix of their franchises on the screen. Like most Full Moon Fanatics, I can&apos;t really say why they appeal to me, the budgets aren&apos;t high, but the acting is usually above normal straight to video fare and they entertain, I guess that&apos;s the bottom line..they entertain.

Now for this movie in particular. The effects were fine (except for the large Baby oopsy),Tim Thomerson always delivers, and both female leads (Tracy Scroggins, and Mellisa Behr), are attractive and do a fine job. Baby Oopsie-Daisy is a riot. I have to admit I really enjoyed the movie, a great way to spend and hour, and that leads me to my only complaint. It was only 64 minutes long. Add in the opening and closing credits along with the flashback sequences to the other movies (Dollman, Demonic Toys, and Bad Channels) to introduce the main characters back stories and you were well under an hour. Now I prefer a shorter movie to a long one. If you can&apos;t tell your story in 2hours or so you just aren&apos;t trying (in most cases). But this was a little too short, no development. Why did the dwarf security guard join the demonic toys so quickly, who was that girl they sacrificed where did she come from? Show me something rather then explain it with one line of dialog. Anyway felt more like an hour long TV episode rather then a movie.

Final decision : I really enjoyed the time spent watching it. There were some good, and some below average effects. Slightly underdeveloped story and characters, but in the end it entertained. It was funny, had some decent action, and was just plain fun.",8,"['Action', 'Fantasy', 'Horror']","['killer doll', 'police', 'supernatural power', 'evil toy', 'sequel']",1993-10-13,['Charles Band'],"['Tim Thomerson', 'Tracy Scoggins', 'Melissa Behr']","['Charles Band', 'Craig Hamann', 'Jackson Barr']"

Quantrill&apos;s Raiders,A Civil War guerilla gang plans an attack on a Kansas arsenal.,"Lawrence, Kansas had to go undergo a seizure from both sides in the Civil War. The first time was John Brown who executed quite a few because they were of southern birth and sympathy. The next time was by William Quantrill who was fighting for the south in his own way of course.

The bloodthirsty Quantrill has been a hand movie villain, there&apos;s not too much you can say good about him. If there is anything true about this film it is strictly unintentional.

Leo Gordon plays Quantrill here and while there&apos;s more Gordon than the real Quantrill that all right by me because Leo Gordon is one of the best and meanest of villains and always fun to watch.

Our protagonist hero is Steve Cochran who is a Confederate army captain traveling as a spy behind Yankee lines. He&apos;s got orders for Quantrill from the Confederate command to destroy the Union arsenal at Lawrence, but don&apos;t do any of the looting and atrocities for which he is getting a bad rep for. Gordon has his own agenda for Lawrence and it has nothing to do with the issues of the Civil War.

Cochran indulges in a little romance with Gale Robbins. Also the very sexy Diane Brewster who is Gordon&apos;s woman makes a play for Cochran.

Tokarev,"When the daughter of a reformed criminal is kidnapped, he rounds up his old crew and seeks his own brand of justice.","Nic Cage is a good actor.

Nic Cage is a man who isn&apos;t afraid to jump the shark a million times and 34 years into his career I would say a million is about correct.

His latest film is Tokarev and its pretty average if i&apos;m honest. After the very good &apos;Joe&apos; and after Cage saying he would focus on more introverted roles, roles that take thought and commitment instead of a lazy performance for a paycheck (cough, Ghost Rider - Spirit Of Vengeance, cough), I knew he would take on a role along these lines and I don&apos;t blame him, the film does certainly have a few things going for it and Cage turns in an above average performance here, there&apos;s quite a few moments where he really shines and a few where he doesn&apos;t but he&apos;s never down right terrible which, considering his good to bad film ration the past 10 years, he should be given a medal for that.

I would recommend you give it a watch, its again pretty average but there are 3 or 4 scenes that surprised me and showed Nic Cage is truly back and he should be watched for the next few years. I think we are going to see a lot of good things from Rage Cage very soon.",5,"['Action', 'Thriller']","['scene during end credits', 'revenge', 'paralysis', 'surprise during end credits', 'ambiguous ending']",2014-05-09,['Paco Cabezas'],"['Nicolas Cage', 'Rachel Nichols', 'Max Ryan']","['Jim Agnew', 'Sean Keller']"

Raging Bull,"The life of boxer Jake LaMotta, whose violence and temper that led him to the top in the ring destroyed his life outside of it.","Raging Bull is one of Martin Scorsese&apos;s best films and with out a doubt the best film of the 80&apos;s. It follows the career of middleweight boxing champion Jake LaMotta as his career progresses but his emotional problems worsen.

The most notable feature in Raging Bull is the colour. All but the home Video footage is shot in black and white. This was a huge risk on Scorsase&apos;s part but it defiantly pays off, the film wouldn&apos;t feel the same had it been done in colour.

Throughout the entire film acting is simply impeccable. De Niro and Pesci are both stunning. The script is amazing, you really feel like you understand every character, none of their actions seem out of character no matter how outrageous they may be.

Scorsese&apos;s directing is stunning. He really is a very talented director and in Raging Bull it shows. The fight scenes are famous for their brutal realism and it&apos;s easy to see why. He puts you right in the ring with the fighters and you cant help but admire their technical brilliance. However, the most stunning aspect of all is Thelma Schoonmaker&apos;s editing. Its some of the best editing I&apos;ve ever seen especially during the fight scenes where it&apos;s positively breathtaking.

No matter what happens you always find yourself sympathising with La Motta, even during his most outrageous moments. Not only is Raging Bull the greatest film to come out of the 80&apos;s but is one of the greatest this century that&apos;s highly underrated and defiantly worth owning.

Ragtime,"A young black pianist becomes embroiled in the lives of an upper-class white family set among the racial tensions, infidelity, violence and other nostalgic events in early 1900s New York City.","Back in the day when Hollywood was grinding out B westerns it wasn&apos;t unusual at all to see famous folks of the west in stories that had absolutely nothing to do with their own lives or to see many famous people interacting when they never even met in real life.

Ragtime revives some of that dubious tradition in filming E.L. Doctorow&apos;s novel about the Teddy Roosevelt years of the first decade of the last century. Teddy figures into this briefly as does his Vice President Charles Fairbanks. Booker T. Washington is here too, as are the principals of the Stanford White murder, and New York City Police Commissioner Rhinelander Waldo.

It&apos;s quite a blend because Roosevelt and Fairbanks ran for re-election in 1904 as Fairbanks is shown delivering a campaign speech. He wasn&apos;t even Vice President then, just a Senator from Indiana. Fairbanks was running for Vice President because Roosevelt had no Vice President in his first term. He succeeded to the presidency when Willima McKinley was assassinated.

The Stanford White murder took place in 1906 and was then called the crime of the century. Many such murders right up to O.J. Simpson were given that dubious distinction. And Rhinelander Waldo was not NYPD Police Commissioner until 1910 and he was much younger than James Cagney. 

Still and all E.L. Doctorow&apos;s book is made into a fine film which got a whole bunch of Academy Award nominations including Best Picture, Best Director for Milos Forman and Supporting player nominations for Howard Rollins, Jr. and Elizabeth McGovern.

The main story is about Coalhouse Walker, Jr. a black ragtime pianist and his Sarah. She has his baby and they&apos;d like to get married. But a whole lot of things, some of them peripherally connected to the true events and people previously mentioned that lead him and a gang to take possession of the Morgan Library and threaten to blow it up.

Howard Rollins was a real tragedy. This was a great start to a short, but brilliant career that included his long running role as Virgil Tibbs in the TV series In the Heat of the Night and the film A Soldier&apos;s Story. He died way too young from AIDS contracted from a lot of intravenous drug use. 

Elizabeth McGovern is the famous Evelyn Nisbet, the girl on the red velvet swing which was the title of another film that dealt with the Stanford White murder. McGovern&apos;s performance is probably closer to the real Evelyn than Joan Collins was in that earlier film. She&apos;s basically a goldigger who juggled two men, her husband Harry K. Thaw and her upscale lover, society architect Stanford White. Her circus act led to White&apos;s death, Thaw&apos;s commitment to an insane asylum and a vaudeville career for her.

Ragtime was eagerly awaited because of the anticipated return of James Cagney to the screen after being off for 19 years. Cagney is clearly aged, but he gets through the role because unlike that television film Terrible Joe Moran, he&apos;s not the center of the film, though he&apos;s first billed. Note that he&apos;s sitting down during most of his performance and when he has to stand the camera is a discreet distance. It&apos;s nothing like the bouncing Cagney of old, but light years better than Terrible Joe Moran.

This was also the final joint appearance as it turned for the team that invented the buddy film, James Cagney and Pat O&apos;Brien even though they have no scenes together. O&apos;Brien is Harry K. Thaw&apos;s attorney and Mrs. O&apos;Brien plays Thaw&apos;s mother under her maiden name of Eloise Taylor. She was an actress before she married Pat, but gave up her career to raise their four children. 

Author Norman Mailer plays Stanford White, fulltime architect and hedonist and Robert Joy plays the demented millionaire Harry K. Thaw and both fit the parts perfectly. Maybe one day we will have a definitive film version just concentrating on the murder and it&apos;s aftermath for the three principals.

Milos Forman gave us a remarkable evocation of an exciting time in American history. It seemed that America had limitless possibilities then. I doubt they&apos;ll be saying that about the first decade of this century.",9,['Drama'],"['racial injustice', 'racial slur', 'period drama', 'american film directed by czech director', 'american film directed by european director']",1981-12-25,['Milos Forman'],"['James Cagney', 'Elizabeth McGovern', 'Howard E.

Raiders of the Lost Ark,"In 1936, archaeologist and adventurer Indiana Jones is hired by the U.S. government to find the Ark of the Covenant before the Nazis can obtain its awesome powers.","I&apos;ve seen Raiders of the Lost Ark numerous times on TV, DVD and big screen. My local theatre had a special showing last night and the 400-seat screen completely sold out (as Indy films always do). Luckily for me and my pal, we got the last 2 tickets available! I can&apos;t think of many films that still sell-out 25 years after their original release. There&apos;s just something about Indy movies(iconic hero, affection, epic spectacle) that brings you back again and again.

The only trouble with that is there are zillions of reviews, critiques and dissections of this movie already out there, so what I have to offer will probably not be anything new. I will however not go the way of the cliché and mention 1930&apos;s serials, Tom Selleck or the sword/gun fight.

I will, however, ask you one question. Did you know that some of the more iconic, memorable sequences from Raiders owe quite a lot to Duck Tales? What? Surely it&apos;s the other way around? Well, no. The globe-trotting adventures of Scrooge McDuck, Huey, Duey, Luey and Donald in Carl Bank&apos;s Disney comic-books from the 50s came first. If you can find some of these then you&apos;ll surely notice the similarities.

The hunt for the Ark of the Covenant is more than just an excuse for action. So many movies these days seem to come up with action first and string them together with some lame plot. Movies like this are quickly forgotten and one of the reasons Raiders holds up so well is because it works the Covenant story so well into the plot.

The action comes in a succession of set-pieces. I do enjoy films that have to increasingly better themselves in every scene. Raiders introduced this as a standard that the sequels had to live up to. My fave scene has to be the massive truck chase through Egypt, which is made up of many of its own smaller sequences. One little idiosyncrasy I like about Indy is that even though he&apos;s a College Professor and Doctor, he has no beef killing people. So very far from the ubiquitous PC heroes of todays movies.

You might think that it&apos;s rather geeky to hype up the editing and sound design, but they do stand out from recent action movies. The gunfire and punching seem to have a sort of &apos;Indy&apos; signature sound to them, that I&apos;ve not heard in any other films. And obviously, John William&apos;s classic score is one of those themes that just everybody in the world knows (though I prefer his score to Temple of Doom), truly one of the best movie themes ever. Better than Star Wars! 

I&apos;m not sure if Spielberg planned on Raiders starting the Indy franchise but there&apos;s already enough in here to establish a whole universe of potential stories and character arcs. There&apos;s talk of a fourth movie at the moment, but I personally don&apos;t think it will happen and I don&apos;t want it to. It&apos;s perfect existing as a trilogy and a sequel that comes traipsing in 18 years after the last is just not going to feel right. Even if you are hungry for more Indy then there are loads of books and video games out there and then there&apos;s the Young Indiana Jones TV show (where are the DVDs?), which are official Indy canon and even starred Ford once (they bounced around in time).

I am giving Raiders 9/10 because I just have a soft spot for Temple of Doom (which is obviously a 10/10 movie). Even 25 years after it first came out it still has the power to captivate the audience and provoke sheer excitement every time. And in 25 years it will still be far superior to almost everything.

Now there&apos;s something you cannot say about The Fast and the Furious!

Rambo: First Blood Part II,Rambo returns to the jungles of Vietnam on a mission to infiltrate an enemy base-camp and rescue the American POWs still held captive there.,"Sylvester Stallone has one of the most recognizable faces in the world for a reason; this genius has created two pop culture Icons Rocky and Rambo. Anywhere, in the world these two characters will be reconized. Stallone has many detractors, but his vision, writing, and acting out these characters has made him rich and sucessful in a highly competitive industry. Before Rambo, his sequel to First Blood, Stallone was just a star like Gene Hackmen, but this movie created a mega star. As part of gen x I love this film, it is a prototype for many action films that followed. The story brings out raw emotions, tension, and adrenaline. The viewer relates with John Rambo his pain, and how the government lies. The action takes the viewer on a incredible ride. I love the battlecry he gives out when he does a chopper assault on the bad guys, and the explosive arrow that smashes his adversary, along with the machine gunning of the computer system at the base. The camera angles, expressions, and physical acting is perfectly done. You leave the picture feeling good, and that is what movie escapism should be. Stallone, who is ridiculed, along with Arnold for his physical acting, can with this ability create a great stage presence. This emotion he creates with his body is done by, how he walks, flexs his arm etc. Could Robert De Niro done this film, maybe(ie Cape Fear) Tom Cruise no way, Val Kilmer No. This film is what an action film should be, I&apos;ve seen very few lines for an Action movie as long as this one.

The movie is very enjoyable to watch and easy to recommend to families to watch (families who have kids at least 13 years old). It&apos;s little bit scary for kids and has pretty dark humor, but it&apos;s still good hearted film. Especially the ending. The acting is great, especially Pietari&apos;s (Onni Tommila) performance is great. Even though it&apos;s a cliché that the adults won&apos;t believe the child, it doesn&apos;t matter, because the film makes you aware that the adults will eventually know what they&apos;re dealing with. The music is also great. Only criticism i have for this movie, is that it didn&apos;t do or show things you really wanted or expected and that the CGI-effects aren&apos;t so great in some parts of the movie and they should have been shorter so they wouldn&apos;t give you that awkward feeling that not-so-good CGI-effects give you.",8,"['Adventure', 'Fantasy', 'Horror']","['christmas', 'snow adventure', 'krampus', 'christmas horror', 'double barreled shotgun']",2010-12-03,['Jalmari Helander'],"['Jorma Tommila', 'Onni Tommila', 'Peeter Jakobi']","['Jalmari Helander', 'Juuso Helander', 'Petri Jokiranta']"

Re-Animator,"After an odd new medical student arrives on campus, a dedicated local and his girlfriend become involved in bizarre experiments centering around the re-animation of dead tissue.","The astute viewer will immediately pick up on the tone of Re-Animator. The introduction (added to the film at the last minute before its release) is a glimpse of the over-the-top nature of the entire production. If one were to be frightened by this intro, he or she will be comforted by the playful cheer of the opening title music. The score was heavily inspired by the famous Psycho score, a classic by Bernard Herrmann.

The movie, inspired by H.P. Lovecraft&apos;s `Herbert West: Re-Animator&apos;, follows a simple plot. Herbert West (played to precise pitch perfection by Jeffrey Combs who, like Bruce Campbell, is a B-Movie legend) is new at Miskatonic Medical University. Immediately, Herbert clashes with Dr. Carl Hill (David Gale) on the subject of `brain death&apos;.

At the same time, Dan Cain (Bruce Abbot) is looking for a roommate. He is also dating Dean Alan Halsey&apos;s (Robert Sampson) daughter, Megan (Barbara Crampton). When Herbert West shows up at Dan&apos;s door one night during a `study&apos; session, Megan is immediately suspicious. Why is Herbert so anxious to move in? Why is he so interested in the basement?

It is not long before the cat is dead, re-animated and dead again. The early scenes of violence are disturbing and hilarious at the same time and are only a taste of what is to come. Dan tries to resist the temptation of power inherent in the re-animating fluid, but is sucked into Herbert&apos;s mad world of life giving.

There is a turn of events about halfway through the film (which I would be crazy to spoil) that almost screams to the viewer, `We aren&apos;t playing by the rules here.&apos; The storyline twists its way to the famous conclusion that, if you haven&apos;t heard of it, will leave you breathless. Even if you know what is going to happen, when you finally see it, in all of it&apos;s gory, sexual glory you understand why this classic has achieved such a status. The finale of the film is twisted in so many ways it&apos;s impossible to count.

 Obviously, I loved the movie. Having never been anything but a horror fan, I cannot say it will suit everyones&apos; tastes. The film is so over-the-top that the outrageous gore becomes less and less shocking. The timid viewer may want to shy away from this masterpiece. Anyone with even the slightest curiosity should seek this movie out.",,"['Comedy', 'Horror', 'Sci-Fi']","['reanimation', 'gore', 'morgue', 'medical research', 'zombie']",1985-10-18,['Stuart Gordon'],"['Jeffrey Combs', 'Bruce Abbott', 'Barbara Crampton']","['H.P.

Reap the Wild Wind,"Florida ship salvager Loxi falls for Jack, captain of a ship wrecked on the Key West shore. However, their romance is complicated by the arrival of another suitor.","Cecil Blount DeMille, CB. The original &apos;Name Above The Title&apos;. No matter what Frank Capra stated it was DeMille who put the Director/Producer over the title. His was a name that brought in the public and their money when Capra was still a &apos;gag man&apos; for Mack Sennett. From the first feature film in Hollywood, THE SQUAW MAN (1914) to his last production, THE BUCCANEER (1958) he represented HollyWoods commercial success.

With DeMille people fall into two (2) camps. We HATE that hack and his hokey movies or we love him for he put our dreams on the screen. We fall into that second group seeing our first DeMille film circa 1957 THE TEN COMMANDMENTS (1956). My brother was four (4) and I was six (6) and we were enthralled with CB from then on. He dared to put BIG THINGS on the screen. They may not of always worked but he was unafraid to do them, stretching the envelope technically and did not give a damn what his critics thought and neither do we.

REAP THE WILD WIND (1942) was his second color film and we saw it in a re-release circa 1958. The plot is typical DeMille, obscure historical incident blown up for the big screen. Romance triangle punctuated by action sequences leading to a rousing conclusion. The film is well cast with Paramount Stars Paulette Goddard and Ray Milland. Not able to get Errol Flynn or Tyrone Power CB obtained John Wayne who turned in a credible and sincere performance. Milland stood up well to the &apos;Duke&apos; and Ms. Goddard was a radiant love interest. A young Susan Hayward also showed her stuff with Robert Preston. Over shadowing all was Raymond Massey as the head villain with stooge Victor Kilian. Not to be forgotten was the CB stock company, from players who were with him during the silent era to Akim Tamiroff in a voice over for the &apos;Lamb&apos;. Paramounts special visual effects wizard Gordon Jennings led that team and garnered a Oscar and Victor Young provide the score. Music being very important in carrying some of the fantastic goings on. Especially the Giant Squid scene that was directed underwater by CB himself.

The one (1) thing we never understood about CB is that he left many (BETTER) projects go fallow after investing money and time developing them. A few were THE WAR OF THE WORLDS, TITANIC and WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE. Two (2) were done by George Pal with CB as uncredited producer. It would have been very interesting to see how these would have turned out if made in the 1930s. Just thinking about the casting and how the special visual effects would have been done is a fascinating mind game.",8,"['Action', 'Adventure', 'Drama']","['typhoon', 'giant squid', 'florida keys', 'gang member', 'song']",1942-06-04,['Cecil B.

Rear Window,"A wheelchair-bound photographer spies on his neighbors from his Greenwich Village courtyard apartment window, and becomes convinced one of them has committed murder, despite the skepticism of his fashion-model girlfriend.","Alfred Hitchcock&apos;s Rear Window, wittily written by John Michael Hayes, is one of his many films I think of as much of a technical exercise as anything else. It is in this sense like his silent The Lodger, the static, confined Lifeboat, and the cut-less, one set Rope. Considered in this light it is a cold masterpiece, playing more with the audience&apos;s thoughts and fears than with its softer, more personal emotions. As such, it is a very cerebral and satisfying piece of work. The plot is deceptively simple: a photographer (James Stewart) is stuck indoors with his leg in a cast during a hot New York summer. His socialite girl-friend (Grace Kelly) is eager to marry him but Stewart has his doubts, since he lives a wandering life and is from a different social class. He spends most of his time idling about and playing with his camera. In time he becomes a voyeur (which he probably already is, to a degree) and begins to observe his neighbors&apos; private lives, as he views them through his lens in the courtyard. He develops attitudes toward each of them, ranging from mild amusement to empathy to sexual interest, depending on who he&apos;s looking at. Without realizing it he is really looking at different aspects of either himself or his relationship with Kelly. The courtyard is a kind of mirror of his soul. These people and their predicaments represent different sides of his (and to a lesser extent Miss Kelly&apos;s) personality, offering glimpses of potential past, present and future selves; and it is not always a flattering picture. The newlyweds are continually having sex; Miss Torso is a beautiful young woman who entertains many suitors; there is a childless, somewhat pathetic-seeming middle-aged couple who dote over a pet dog; Miss Lonelyhearts is a depressed, aging spinster with no apparent friends; and the young, bachelor song-writer, when he isn&apos;t trying to compose songs, is either throwing parties or fits. Then there are the Thorwalds, a squabbling couple across the way. Stewart is at first only slightly interested in them until Mrs. Thorwald disappears and her husband starts going out at night carrying paper parcels that look like they came from a butcher shop. Soon Stewart is, understandably, suspicious. He convinces Kelly that something is amiss, but has trouble with his detective friend. His nurse Stella agrees that something is wrong across the courtyard, and the threesome become amateur detectives. Rear Window is great fun. It&apos;s a thriller, a romance, a mystery, and at times a comedy of manners. The actors all give superb, unflashy performances. Hitchcock had been making movies for three decades by the time he undertook this one, and he knew exactly what he was doing; everything happens as it should, on time, with no fuss or bother. The courtyard set is magnificently designed and photographed; it looks both artificial and realistic, and seems almost to change at times, as circumstances dictate. This is, after Dial M For Murder, Hitchcock&apos;s first truly &apos;fifties&apos; film, which is to say it is a far cry from the genteel romances and spy stuff he&apos;d been doing before. There&apos;s less use of atmosphere here, as a new, more independent director was emerging, decidedly post-Selznick, often using color. Hitchcock is playing a sort game of cinematic chess, moving people and things around here and there, changing camera angles slyly, never showing his hand. The film lacks only warmth. All sorts of learned books and articles have been written about this picture, some of them quite silly; all at least partly right. This is at times a profound film, but it also aims to entertain, it has a light touch, and it can be scary, it&apos;s romantic about couples and cynical about people. There&apos;s a little bit of everything in it,--it&apos;s a work of art.",9,"['Mystery', 'Thriller']","['wheelchair', 'voyeur', 'apartment', 'amateur detective', 'based on short story']",1954-09-01,['Alfred Hitchcock'],"['James Stewart', 'Grace Kelly', 'Wendell Corey']","['John Michael Hayes', 'Cornell Woolrich']"

And like most sequels , this turned out to be a bitter disappointment.

This film carries on straight after the first. The virus ( or so it seams) is still in the building and this time a special ops team and a specialist go in to stop it in it&apos;s tracks. Obviously then things then turn really ugly.

I found Rec 2 a bit of a mess. It&apos;s extremely loud and at times disorientating with the speed camera work.

Harlow is at her best, in out of and almost out of her shimmering costumes and she is ably backed by an excellent cast who all seem to be enjoying themselves. I am indebted to another IMDb reviewer who points out that at the time of original release the States were in depression and the coal bosses and their &apos;society&apos; entourage, getting rich and doing very little, would have been a welcome target for Harlow&apos;s exploits.

There seemed to be very little use of stuntpersons or body doubles in the majority of fight scenes. Bridgette Nielsen clearly worked it off to put on a good showing. How Schwarzanegger got top billing I&apos;m not sure, but his limited part was, of course, excellently portrayed. Film quality was fair, considering the fantasy-esque backdrop and the fact that it was shot in the early 80s. I&apos;ll go out wide on a limb and give it a couple of stars.

My take: 6.5",,"['Action', 'Adventure', 'Fantasy']","['sword and sorcery', 'redheaded woman', 'female nudity', 'hyborian age', 'cult film']",1985-07-03,['Richard Fleischer'],"['Arnold Schwarzenegger', 'Brigitte Nielsen', 'Sandahl Bergman']","['Robert E.

Soleil rouge,"In 1870, a gang robs a train and steals a ceremonial Japanese sword meant as a gift for the U.S. President, prompting a manhunt to retrieve it.","Red Sun is the type of film they mean when they talk about international production. American Charles Bronson, Japanese Toshiro Mifune, German Ursula Andress, French Alain Delon, Italian Capucine and for good measure this film was shot on the plains of Spain which did not look like they&apos;d seen much rain by Englishman Terrence Young.

The film concerns the train robbery of a gang in which Alain Delon is in charge. The money isn&apos;t enough for Delon, the train is carrying some Japanese passengers with a ceremonial samurai sword, a gift from their Emperor to our president. Two of three Japanese are killed, the mistake Delon makes when he decides the sword would make a nice souvenir is that he lives a real live Samurai in Toshiro Mifune alive with a vengeance quest. Delon makes a second mistake in double crossing Charles Bronson and not killing him as well. Bronson is a member of his gang who cuts all ties, but forms an uneasy alliance with Mifune.

Mifune wants Delon dead, but Bronson just wants him alive long enough to say where he&apos;s hidden the money. Bronson and Mifune go to a bordello run by Capucine to get Ursula Andress, a hooker favored by Delon as a hostage.

Red Sun works nicely as a film because of the interesting if antagonistic chemistry between Bronson and Mifune. From an uneasy alliance they develop a genuine regard for each other. As for Delon he has a gentlemanly demeanor that&apos;s a very thin veneer for one of the meanest mean streaks ever on the big screen.

Fans who are younger will recognize the plot of Red Sun being later used in a modern day feature Renegades with Kiefer Sutherland and Lou Diamond Phillips as the uneasy allies with Rob Knepper as the gang leader with a mean streak.

The clown (and his accompanying unoriginal circus music) are wooden -- especially the face -- the real expressiveness is left to Red himself, which he manages by wheel (body) and saddle (head) movements which clearly refer to Disney animal characters in the viewer&apos;s memory.

Reign of Fire,"A brood of fire-breathing dragons emerges from the earth and begins setting everything ablaze, establishing dominance over the planet.","`Reign of Fire&apos;s&apos; premise is simple: the world has been wiped out by airborne, fire-breathing dragons, who at first multiplied by the thousands but now themselves are starving and dying off. A few bands of people remain here and there trying to survive. Quinn (Christian Bale, with whiskers and glottal stops), who was on the scene as a boy in London when the first sleeping dragon awakened in a cave unearthed by an Underground project his mum was working on, leads a group of survivors in the north of England who&apos;re just trying to get a crop going for the next year and save a little mob of children. In comes Van Zan (Mathew McConaughey, with shaved head and brawny tattooed arms) leading an American helicopter crew. He&apos;s become a dragon slayer and since he&apos;s found there&apos;s only one male dragon left and it&apos;s somewhere around London, he&apos;s come to solicit aid. Quinn refuses. Van Zan pushes on to London without Quinn. They fail. He returns and begs Quinn to come as guide. What follows is the finale.

If you probe too deeply into the premise you&apos;re not going to have any fun, but fun is what this movie offers, glorious mindless fun and, above all, fabulous apocalyptic visuals of twisted metal, crepuscular landscapes, dark hulking ruins, and men crawling through them to fire off weapons at the evil birds, which look very graceful as they sweep through the skies and spurt out long expanding streams of fire. Shots are so stunningly composed you want them to freeze-frame. Within the dark end-of-the-world light there is amazing clarity. Working with Ridley Scott&apos;s cinematographer Adrian Biddle, X-Files director Rob Bowman has produced the best fantasy landscape this year next to `Lord of the Rings.&apos; When Van Zan leads a hunt in the sky, it&apos;s like a computer game, and sometimes we see the game through the eyes of the dragon and it looks like a degraded digital film. However, it&apos;s not ingenuity of conception but sheer aesthetic appeal that makes the visuals of this movie so good.

The other large positive factor is the very solid, mostly English cast including a number of appealing youngsters led by Scott James Moutter as Jared, Quinn&apos;s adopted son, not to mention Bale, who brings a striking level of naturalness and conviction to his role as the sensitive, conscience-stricken Quinn. Bale&apos;s a foil to McConaughey&apos;s American macho militarist icon. McConaughey, whose finely chiseled face can be seen staring in mirrors in `Thirteen Conversations About One Thing,&apos; is having a lark playing a brute here, but in the moments when he isn&apos;t shouting, he gives Van Zan almost as much conviction as Bale gives Quinn. Ladies are in short supply in this story: there&apos;s Alex (Izabella Scorupco) as Van Zan&apos;s helicopter pilot who winds up with Quinn, and for five minutes there&apos;s Alice Krige as young Quinn&apos;s mum. But since this movie&apos;s ideal audience might surely be young teenage boys, that&apos;s probably enough. Other things are lacking too, such as more variety in the dragons, more recognizable details of the wrecked London of the final scenes, some more colorful characters among Quinn&apos;s community, as in post-apocalyptic classics like `Mad Max.&apos; But to say that is to miss the point, which is that this is a fast, exhilarating ride that&apos;s a feast for the eyes. If you want to view all this as a `B&apos; horror picture, fine: just grant that it&apos;s a first-class version. To be seen, by all means, on a big screen, preferably in a big, old-time movie house.",,"['Action', 'Adventure', 'Fantasy']","['dragon', 'fire breathing dragon', 'castle', 'military', 'final showdown']",2002-07-12,['Rob Bowman'],"['Matthew McConaughey', 'Christian Bale', 'Izabella Scorupco']","['Gregg Chabot', 'Kevin Peterka', 'Matt Greenberg']"

Rendez-Vous,She had a dream and achieving it didn&apos;t seem that difficult. Or so she thought.,"The German title of the movie is Obsessed ... which may be a bit missleading. Then again Rendez-Vouz is not really something that explains much either is it now? But don&apos;t let that stand in the way of a drama of a woman that has issues in her marriage and finds some satisfaction in another place.

That may sound simple but the movie actually is very good! It really builds up to something and the decisions that are being made make sense. This may be one of the best dramas about infidelity ... of course that is not all there is. There are a few twists on the way and some feelings that are being taken advantage of ... and yet the movie might be able to surprise you here and there.

I&apos;ve watched it many times since and it STILL knocks me out! Alex Cox has made quite a few strange movies since this, mostly excellent (check out &apos;Three Businessmen&apos; sometime), a few not so good, but this is gonna be the movie he will always be remembered for. It&apos;s a black comedy, a science fiction movie, a buddy film, a punk rock movie, it&apos;s all kinda things. There has been nothing quite like it made before or since!

The supporting cast are all first rate, especially Tracey Walter (Miller) and Sy Richardson (Lite), two actors who never became household names but who still generate knowing smiles and nods from cult movie fans everywhere at the mere mention of their names. Also keep an eye out for an almost unrecognizable Miguel Sandoval (&apos;Get Shorty&apos;, &apos;Blow&apos;). Cox would use him in most of his subsequent movies, most notably his absurdist classic &apos;Three Businessmen&apos;. &apos;Repo Man&apos; also has a celebrated soundtrack by Iggy Pop, Black Flag, Suicidal Tendencies and others. The Circle Jerks also perform in a memorable sequence. This movie is a cult classic which looks as good now as it did back in the 1980s. I love it.

Resident Evil,"A special military unit fights a powerful, out-of-control supercomputer and hundreds of scientists who have mutated into flesh-eating creatures after a laboratory accident.","I had to sift long and deep for a good comment on this. Why all the hostility? I think there was great chemistry on this production and it shows; the actors and crew involved loved the game and had a good time making this. This movie successfully recreated the feel of the game, and because it kept exposition to a minimum of what you needed to know for this particular story and didn&apos;t borrow from or revise any of the original characters or settings, it supported and strengthened the franchise. No story is retold here, no words are wasted, the setting, feel and pace is familiar to fans of Resident Evil and yet it&apos;s perfectly accessible to those unfamiliar with the broader storyline. Not giving the fan-boys their favorite characters was a good choice since characters tend to get mangled in adaptation, and yet the fan-boys still complain. With this film you have a good, watchable story that can partake of the Resident Evil cosmology, showing it due respect.

It did an excellent job establishing characters without too much unnecessary background, developing them just enough to make you want to know what they&apos;ll do next, to make you care before the sudden and gruesome happens to them. The acting was above par for a Resident Evil, certainly much better than the first game. The plot was no more comic bookish than any of the games. My one complaint was that the characters were too battle-trained, too slick, too good at fighting for them to be sympathetic horror subjects. This could&apos;ve been balanced out with more reaction shots showing the soldiers wetting themselves. But Alice&apos;s over-the-top commando-style action made her too much of a super heroine to really make anyone concerned about her survival; characters made of Teflon make good action but apathetic horror subjects.",8,"['Action', 'Horror', 'Sci-Fi']","['amnesia', 'doberman', 'quarantine', 'flashback', 'killer dog']",2002-03-15,['Paul W.S.

Resident Evil: Apocalypse,"Alice wakes up in the Raccoon City hospital after the area has been overrun by zombies, and must now make it out of the city before a nuclear bomb is dropped.","A film that directly continues the first part of the saga known as Resident Evil.

The casting is excellent, Sienna Guillory is the right choice for the role of Jill Valentine. Alice, Jill and Carlos fight not only against time, but also against a formidable opponent called Nemesis.

Nemesis looks great, quite sinister and scary. The make-up and special effects team did a great job.

The film is solidly directed, although the fight scenes could have been better, but overall it&apos;s not bad at all. Carlos Olivera is a fun character, Oded Fehr portrayed him excellently.

Milla Jovovich is always excellent as Alice.

What is specific about these kinds of films, and especially about this Resident Evil franchise, is that you can watch it many times, and each time it is more fun. It is designed to entertain the viewer and it certainly succeeds in that.

Remember when Nightmare on Elm Street came out? EVERYONE could relate to nightmares and that&apos;s what made those movies legendary at the time. So go outside and get some experience in real life, maybe you&apos;ll appreciate your movies more :P

They open it, toxic fumes are unleashed, they get sick, and start craving brains. Soon enough, zombies are coming out of the ground with the same cravings for brains.

Return of the Living Dead Part II is a much sillier film than the original, which is saying a lot because the original could get pretty silly at times, too. James Karen and Thom Matthews return as different characters, but these characters are far more shrill, whiny, and annoying than the ones they played in the original.

The Return of the Pink Panther,"Inspector Jacque Clouseau (Peter Sellers) is put on the case when the Pink Panther diamond is stolen, with the Phantom&apos;s trademark glove the only clue.","Return Of The Pink Panther marked Peter Sellers first appearence as Inspector Closeau since A Shot In The Dark (1964) and kicked off a celebrated Pink Panther sequel trilogy. To follow was The Pink Panther Strikes Again and Revenge Of The Pink Panther. I say trilogy because of course &apos;Revenge&apos; saw Sellers&apos; last outing before his premature death.

 This film is a refreshing return to the roots of the original with Closeau on the trail of the PP diamond after it is once again stolen by the infamous Phantom. The Phantom&apos;s alter-ego, Sir Charles Webb (Christopher Plummer taking over from David Niven), is naturally assusmed to be the culprit but he is in fact innocent and so joins in the search.

Steve, from the first page, is spot on with his review of the film. It is slow and quite dismal when Sellers is not on screen and the sub-plot involving Sir Charles is weak and uninteresting, which was not the case with Niven in the original but nevertheless Plummer is an inspired choice for the role. Actually, the whole story isn&apos;t really clear or upfront, just Sellers at his best. And when he is on the screen, its gleaming with hilarity with a genius at play.

The result is a comedy which has its obvious flaws but also one which has many, many memorable and rip-roaring laughs. Return Of The Pink Panther is an irrestible treat and a must-see. I&apos;m just having trouble figuring out which is better - this or Strikes Again.

The Return of the Vampire,"When an errant bomb unearths the coffin of a vampire during the London Blitz, a gravedigger unknowingly reanimates the monster by removing the stake from his heart","Return of the Vampire is, despite its title not a sequel to Mark of the Vampire.

He has the help of a werewolf that can talk and killings once again start...

One of the best things about this movie is that talking werewolf. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve seen another movie with one. Unusual.

The cast is lead by Bela Logosi as the Dracula-like vampire. I&apos;ve never heard of anybody else in this.

Return of the Vampire is worth checking out, especially if you are a fan of Bela.

Richard Pryor: Live on the Sunset Strip,Richard Pryor performs his stand-up comedy act on the Sunset Strip.,"Pryor on the cusp and on the mend, halfway between the careening scatological genius of his 70s persona and the PG-rated grown man of the 80s. Yes PG Pryor generally sucks, but you know, setting yourself on fire can and should mellow anybody out. This movie is a stab at synthesis - he&apos;s still cultivating his mastery of the squirmy edge, but at the same time he&apos;s just turned his keen-eyed intelligence in on himself. It&apos;s funny and it&apos;s also very, very moving. The N-word disavowal is of course breathtaking - coming from Pryor it&apos;s like Rene Levesque doing a stop-smoking PSA. The story of being rescued from his talking freebase pipe by Jim Brown is another peak. And topping all is his seemingly spontaneous response to a shouted Mudbone request, applying that character&apos;s merciless storytelling bravado to the ballad of Richard Pryor. There are more dud bits than I&apos;d like, but who cares? This is a fitting testament to a great artist and a good man.",9,"['Documentary', 'Comedy']","['scene during opening credits', 'aerial camera shot', 'stand up comedy special', 'sunset strip', 'live performance']",1982-03-12,['Joe Layton'],"['Richard Pryor', 'Gene Cross', 'Julie Hampton']","['Paul Mooney', 'Richard Pryor']"

The Right Stuff,"The U.S. space program&apos;s development from the breaking of the sound barrier to selection of the Mercury 7 astronauts, from a group of test pilots with a more seat-of-the-pants approach than the program&apos;s more cautious engineers pr...","&apos;The Right Stuff&apos; is one of the most glorious adventure films ever made, a story of incredible heroism, poignant romance, gripping drama, and broad humor...and amazingly, it has actually happened within our lifetimes!

This is a tale of test pilots, &apos;pushing the envelope&apos;, proving the sound barrier couldn&apos;t constrain mankind&apos;s reach for space. Leading the way is plain-speaking Chuck Yeager (portrayed by Sam Shepard with Gary Cooper-like charm), a Beeman&apos;s gum-chewing cowboy with a passion for his feisty wife (the beautiful Barbara Hershey), and hot planes. Not even a broken rib could hold him back when an opportunity to fly the X-1 was offered. His record-breaking flight could fill a movie by itself...and this is just the BEGINNING of the story!

Jumping ahead a few years, Yeager is joined by a new breed of test pilots, whose total love of flight challenges their relationships, and is the true measure of how they define themselves. Among them are &apos;Gordo&apos; Cooper (Dennis Quaid), a hot dog jet jockey with an unhappy wife (Pamela Reed, giving an exceptional performance); and Gus Grissom (Fred Ward, in his breakthrough role), coarse and direct, and anxious for his shot at the fastest jets.

The entire world changes when the Russians launch Sputnik, in 1957. As the American space program struggles to &apos;catch up&apos;, the government realizes that American men will have to go into space, and President Eisenhower wants &apos;educated&apos; test pilots to fill this role. Yeager is out (he never completed college), but Cooper and Grissom, and many others, compete for spots in the New Frontier.

These pilots, from all services, are weeded down to seven men, dubbed &apos;Astronauts&apos;, and the Mercury Space Program is born! Along with Cooper and Grissom, the story focuses on Navy pilot Alan Shepard (Scott Glenn), laconic and prone to ethnic humor; and Marine John Glenn (perfectly cast Ed Harris), a &apos;boy scout&apos; of unimpeachable morals, who loyally supports an impaired wife (sensitively portrayed by Mary Jo Deschanel). Working under the glare of the world press, the seven gradually come to respect one another, and embark on an epic adventure, full of triumph and tragedy!

Meanwhile, Chuck Yeager, snubbed by NASA, continues to test new generations of jets, pushing the &apos;envelope&apos;, until, in a climactic scene, he achieves the threshold of space, himself. The flight is a near disaster, resulting in a horrendous crash, but the image of the burned but undefeated pilot, walking proudly away from the wreckage, is an unforgettable image of courage, and truly defines &apos;The Right Stuff&apos;!

This is a REMARKABLE film in every way, and is director Philip Kaufman&apos;s masterpiece. Lushly scored by Tom Conti (who won an Oscar for the Tchaikovsky-inspired music), the film soars, both on earth and in space!

If you believe the Age of Heroes is past, watch &apos;The Right Stuff&apos;, and you might change your mind!

The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich,,"Based on the best-selling book by the same name, this film documents the events that led to Germany transitioning from a democracy to a totalitarian state and from there to complete ruin. True to much of the book this documentary focuses mainly on the methods used by Adolf Hitler to achieve complete domination upon his subjects and the pure evil which resulted. Perhaps the most powerful point of this film was the way the Nazis treated the Jews and it was brought home very poignantly by the drawings of Jewish children on a wall prior to being led to their execution. Although quite sad it also serves as a very powerful indictment as well. Now, while I would have certainly preferred more details on the Russian Front as well as that by the Allies, this documentary provides more than enough historical information to keep the attention of most viewers from beginning to end. I have rated the film accordingly.

Excellent, naturalistic performances by Holbrook, Robin Gammell and (actor-producer) Lawrence Dane, as a bunch of rather ordinary guys caught in extraordinary circumstances. I particularly liked the fact that the killer&apos;s motivations are suggested, but never fully explained. The setting and cinematography, particularly during the night scenes, are pretty creepy. All in all, if you&apos;re a fan of subtle, realistic, quality horror, check this one out. Kind of surprised Ebert gave this a thumbs down. Seems like his kind of flick.

Road to Perdition,"A mob enforcer&apos;s son in 1930s Illinois witnesses a murder, forcing him and his father to take to the road, and his father down a path of redemption and revenge.","Road to Perdition, a movie undeservedly overlooked at that year Oscars is the second work of Sam Mendes (and in my opinion his best work), a director who three years before won Oscar for his widely acclaimed but controversial American Beauty. This is a terrific movie, and at the same time ultimately poignant and sad.

It&apos;s a story of a relatively wealthy and happy family from outward appearance during difficult times of Depression when the, Michael Sullivan, a father of two children, played by great Tom Hanks (I&apos;m not his admirer but ought to say that) is a hit-man for local mafia boss, played by Paul Newman. His eldest son, a thirteen years boy Michael Sullivan Jr., perfectly played by young Tyler Hoechlin, after years of blissful ignorance finds out what is his father job and on what money their family live. Prompted by his curiosity and his aspiration to know truth he accidentally becomes a witness of a murder, committed by John Rooney, son of his father boss. Such discovery strikes an innocent soul and it caused numerous events that changed his life forever. The atmosphere of the period, all the backgrounds and decorations are perfectly created, editing and cinematography are almost flawless while the story is well written. But the main line of the movie, the most important moments and points of the movie and the key factor of the movie success are difficult father-son relations in bad times. They are shown so deeply, strong and believable. Tom Hanks does excellent and has one of the best performances of his career in a quite unusual role for him and all acting across the board is superb. Finally worth to mention a very nice score by Paul Newman and in the result we get an outstanding work of all people involved in making this beautiful (but one more time sad) masterpiece. I believe Road to Perdition belongs to greatest achievements of film-making of this decade and undoubtedly one of the best films of the year.

Roadie,"A young Texas good ol&apos; boy has a knack with electronic equipment, and that talent gets him a job as a roadie with a raucous travelling rock-and-roll show.","This movie, in my opinion has many of the features of a cult classic.

The acting is uneven, the comedy is uneven, and the plot is a cliché.

But the movie is worth watching (as a cult movie,) for a number of reasons.

1) Ecletic and enjoyable sound track including a fun cover of Ring of Fire (and you can&apos;t experience too many covers of Ring of Fire.) 2) A mix of different comic elements such as an amusing car chase, and Forest Gump like moments where Redfish is simply in the right place at the right time 3) Great rock and roll cameos 4) Occasional surreal moments, if you like that kind of thing

Another part I found refreshing was doing a rock and roll movie involving a groupie with no gratuitous sex or nudity. I have nothing against those things, but its refreshing to see a movie that had no need for them.

If you take the movie seriously for a minute, or are looking for a consistent style of humor you will be disappointed.

Robin Hood: Men in Tights,"A spoof of Robin Hood in general, and Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves (1991) in particular.","Robin Hood: Men in Tights (1993)

Robin Hood: Men in Tights is far from Mel Brooks&apos; best film, but it definitely is hilarious. As far as his films that parody other film franchises go, its no Young Frankenstein but it is better than Dracula: Dead and Loving it. 

Not the greatest acting but few comedies ever do. There may not be any great performances but they are funny performances. I don&apos;t think I would have thought that Cary Elwes was the right choice to play the lead in this film, but they made the right choice by picking him. He gave a very Princess Bride like performance that worked out well. Dave Chappell gave a good debut performance, though he definitely wasn&apos;t as funny as he would become later on. Mark Blankfield as Blinkin I think is probably the most remembered character in the film and its for good reason, he is hilarious. 

The film is full of great Mel Brooks style jokes and gags that would make The Marx Brothers proud. Some jokes are misses and are slightly painful due to how unfunny they are but those come rare, its usually consistently funny. It&apos;s probably my favorite Mel Brooks movie after Young Frankenstein and Blazing Saddles. Though it is a little less liked and a little dumber, I think fans of those two films will still like this one. 

Before you watch Robin Hood Men in Tights I would suggest you see at least one other version of Robin Hood, to understand the story they are making fun of. Im sure the film would still be funny who didn&apos;t know the story but I think some knowledge of the legend would make it better. 

Anyone who likes Mel Brooks, anyone who likes Robin Hood and anyone who likes comedies should give it a try. Some people might find it a little annoying and dumb at times but I think most people will at least get enough laughs to like it.

RoboCop,"In a dystopic and crime-ridden Detroit, a terminally wounded cop returns to the force as a powerful cyborg haunted by submerged memories.","In a futurist Detroit, crime is high and the police are run by a massive private company, keener to reduce running costs than reduce crime. When their new police robot ED209 develops a glitch, they turn to a prototype that blends human tissue with high-tech circuitry. Meanwhile Police officer Murphy and his partner Lewis are out gunned by criminals leaving Murphy mortally wounded. OCP take Murphy&apos;s body and use it to make Robocop. However Robocop is so successful that he is targeted by criminal Boddicker. Boddicker turns to his shadowy partners in crime, while Robocop struggles to deal with human memories and a programming system that seems designed to control him and keep him in the dark.

Verhoeven&apos;s first US film was to set the mould for how the rest of his career would pan out - extreme violence and very little idea of restraint. However this is one of his best films and has much in common with one of his other best (Starship Troopers) - ultra-violence, funny black humour, great action and tonnes of satirical digs at modern life. Here the plot revolves around the creation of Robocop and his fight against crime that goes right to the top. This is complimented by the sub-plot of him trying to rediscover his human side. This is full of great action scenes and eccentric villains.

The black comedy is funny, although sometimes you feel bad laughing at so much violence, but the sideswipes are the best. Verhoeven takes digs at TV with his advert filled news broadcasts, at privatisation by showing the crumbling police stations and the huge corporate towers and at heroism by showing Robocop creating just as much mayhem and destruction as the criminals he pursues. His strength however is the action scenes and the sense of tension he creates - I&apos;ll don&apos;t think anyone can forget the sheer terror of ED209&apos;s `glitch&apos;.

Weller is good - cast because of his strong jaw and ability to project emotion through a suit of armour - and he does manage to bring out the human side. Allen is good but a but dry. The real support comes from the eccentric, and well known villains and corporate bosses. Ronny Cox, Smith, Ray Wise, Perry, O&apos;Herlihy and Miguel Ferrer are all great in various capacities. Criminal or greedy corporate leader - it&apos;s hard to tell which is which at times.

A classic bit of sci-fi. Verhoeven has sadly not had a moment as fine as this since and has recently had problems being excessive in Hollywood - the land of excess!

Rock of Ages,A small-town girl and a city boy meet on the Sunset Strip while pursuing their Hollywood dreams.,"While perhaps overlong, the film is packed with rocking music and a game cast that keeps the energy going and you&apos;ll be hard pressed not to be swept up in it. It&apos;s loud and over the top but it embraces its absurdity that would normally have characters breaking into song at almost any moment feel unnatural to say the least. With almost non-stop music and most characters having a moment in the spotlight through a song, Rock of Ages is a perfectly entertaining movie with a performance from Tom Cruise like no other that carries most of the film&apos;s laughs.

Noting the disappointing box office performance of the film, it can be credited to an unfocused marketing campaign that had trouble selling the film&apos;s admittedly flimsy and predictable story and not highlighting the main characters in the film, particularly as the film is driven by its two youngest stars. This would of given audiences something tangible to be attracted to. Instead it advertised through the cheesy line &apos;nothin&apos; but a good time&apos; packing it&apos;s advertisements with the stars and the music but never seeming like a &apos;must see&apos; specifically considering the talent involved",7,"['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Musical']","['rock', 'concert', 'pole dancer', 'music industry', 'male male kiss']",2012-06-15,['Adam Shankman'],"['Julianne Hough', 'Diego Boneta', 'Tom Cruise']","['Justin Theroux', 'Chris D&apos;Arienzo', 'Allan Loeb']"

Roller Boogie,Skaters band together to keep their roller-disco open.,"I have seen this movie dozens of times and rate it as one of the best cult movies ever made.

Hilarious and completely unbelievable street chase scene with limos vs. skaters...must see it to believe it. I was especially impressed with the performance of Jim Bray, who plays Linda Blair&apos;s love interest. Bray was cast because he was an actual champion skater of his day and he did admirably well in his acting debut. Not only is he an amazing skater but also comes off with an honest and believable acting style and he will remind any 30 something of someone they knew in highschool.

Rollercoaster,A blackmailer threatens to sabotage roller coasters at various American amusement parks if he isn&apos;t paid a huge ransom.,"i thought this was a pretty good little thriller.it kept me entertained throughout,and it never became boring.In a nutshell,it&apos;s a about a guy who blows up a roller coaster ride and extorts money from the owners of other amusement parks to keep more of the same from happening to their roller coasters.Timothy Bottoms plays the psychopath,with George Segal as his main nemesis.Bottoms is quite chilling and cold,and Segals&apos; character matches wits him.watch for a young Helen Hunt,as well.i really liked the music by Lalo Schifrin,which is reminiscent of Bernard Herrmann.it really added to the atmosphere.the tension and suspense is down to the wire in this one.for me,Roller-coaster is a 6/10",6,"['Action', 'Crime', 'Drama']","['amusement park', 'vietnam war veteran', 'psychotronic film', 'male protagonist', 'fbi federal bureau of investigation']",1977-06-17,['James Goldstone'],"['George Segal', 'Timothy Bottoms', 'Richard Widmark']","['Sanford Sheldon', 'Richard Levinson', 'William Link']"

Romancing the Stone,"A mousy romance novelist sets off for Colombia to ransom her kidnapped sister, and soon finds herself in the middle of a dangerous adventure hunting for treasure with a mercenary rogue.","This exciting adventure tale concerns about a romantic,feisty writer named Joan Wilder-Kathleen Turner-who becomes involved in a dangerous journey to Colombia.He goes to rescue her sister,being kidnapped by a sympathetic mobsters-Danny DeVito-.Into lush jungles of Colombia,she finds a soldier of fortune named Jack Colton-Michael Douglas-who becomes to her ally.

This agreeable comedy-adventure blends unstopped action,rip roaring,love story,cliff hunger,tongue in cheek and is extremely funny and entertaining.For comic relief with delightful bit of humor are supplied by Danny DeVito and continuous jokes about relationship between both stars: Turner and Douglas.The picture contains spectacular scenarios,some nice stunts and funny lines.Colorful cinematography by Dean Cundey,Zemeckis&apos;s usual cameraman(Back to the future trilogy,Who framed Roger Rabbit).Noisy though catching music with synthesizer score by Alan Silvestri,posteriorly he made an excellent symphonic soundtrack,he&apos;s also Zemeckis habitual(Polar Express,Castaway,What lies beneath,Forrest Gump).The motion picture is well directed by successful director Robert Zemeckis.It&apos;s followed by an enjoyable sequel directed by Lewis Teague: Jewel of Nile.The film will have you on the edge of your seat but the adventure and action never let up.It&apos;s a winner for Douglas and Turner fans.Worthwhile seeing it but will not displease those seeking likable and rip-snorting stories.",7,"['Action', 'Adventure', 'Comedy']","['colombia', 'treasure map', 'romance novelist', 'rescue mission', 'emerald']",1984-03-30,['Robert Zemeckis'],"['Michael Douglas', 'Kathleen Turner', 'Danny DeVito']","['Diane Thomas', 'Lem Dobbs', 'Howard Franklin']"
Romper Stomper,A group of skinheads become alarmed at the way their neighbourhood is changing.,"Firstly, I&apos;d like to start by saying that anyone who thinks this is somehow pro-racist or pro-skinhead has REALLY missed the point, thats if they&apos;ve even seen it,that is. That would be like saying &apos;Saving Private Ryan&apos; glorifies war, or &apos;Trainspotting&apos; glorifies drugs.

It revolves around a bunch of lawless Australian skinheads, as they party to loud skrewdriver-esquire music, drink, fight (amongst each other as well as against the Vietnamese immigrants living nearby), cause mayhem..and so on so forth. They are living in a dilapidated old garage and scrounge off the system whilst hating it. They are portrayed as hopeless, angry lost kids held together by a psychopathic and violent leader;Hando Where to start with Hando, seriously, this is undoubtedly Russel Crowe&apos;s most unforgettable performance. Whether its his tattoo&apos;s, shaved head, unshaven face or cold eyed glare...you can&apos;t help but be drawn in by Hando. He is by far the most relentless and ruthless member of the gang, and during the film you wonder whether or not they&apos;d even exist without him.

During the film, things take a turn for the worse, actually they take several turns for the worst...which has an increasingly negative effect on the gang.

I rated this film a 9, as it achieves what it sets out to do. Give the viewer a no-holds barred trip into the destructive lives of social outsiders, and the violence and hatred that follows. Not easy viewing, but I recommend this film to anyone who likes their movies gritty and upfront.",9,"['Crime', 'Drama', 'Thriller']","['skinhead', 'shot in the forehead', 'neo nazi', 'laundry drying on a clothesline', 'male wears underwear']",1992-11-12,['Geoffrey Wright'],"['Russell Crowe', 'Daniel Pollock', 'Jacqueline McKenzie']",['Geoffrey Wright']
The Room,,"Tommy Wiseau ranks among the greats: Spielberg, Scorcese, Griffith, & Welles. In THE ROOM, he has created a piece of cinema that has no parallels. It is a unique piece of artistic greatness.

Let&apos;s first discuss Mr. Wiseau&apos;s expert crafting of dramatic tension. Denny, the slightly mentally retarded 20-year-old, wants to watch Johnny and Lisa make sweet love. Denny also frequently acts like a brain-damaged Golden Retriever in that he continually wants to play catch with a football, even though everyone only stands 6 feet apart. Denny eventually gets involved with drugs and has to confront the hate-filled Chris-R (and there is no logical reason why the character has a hyphen in his name so don&apos;t ask). Johnny nobly comes out of nowhere to provide Denny salvation, and then this plot point is totally forgotten.

The best part of the movie is Mr. Wiseau&apos;s acting. He is leagues ahead of other contemporary actors. He is on par with DeNiro in Raging Bull, Nicholson in Easy Rider, and Brando in Streetcar. He delivers his lines as if he IS Johnny, the All-American guy who is trying to stay on the wagon and can&apos;t get that promotion at work. He clearly has been well-trained in Method Acting. His Croatian-Serbian-Norwegian-Klingon-Mongolian-Yugoslavian accent is barely noticeable when he delivers lines such as `You&apos;re tearing me apart, Lisa&apos; and `I treat you like a princess but you stab me in the back.&apos; You feel Johnny&apos;s pain as he becomes a regular MacGyver and hooks up a tape recorder that is able to record for 24 hours straight. His laugh (ha-ha-ha) comes off as natural as can be. When you think JOHNNY, you think All-American guy. The fact that Mr. Wiseau is over sixty years of age and may be on some kind of horse tranquilizer for much of the movie is not an issue.

In the trailers for THE ROOM, it is mentioned that Mr. Wiseau&apos;s directing and writing evoke Tennessee Williams, and a truer statement has never been made. You can feel the passion when Johnny transforms himself into Frankenstein and proceeds to destroy his room, moving at a very slow speed. It is as if he is saying to the viewer, `Stella!!&apos; except Mr. Wiseau does not need to say it verbally. He says it through his emaciated skin which has seen better days and through his jet-black hair which is clearly his natural color. Even though the Room takes place in San Francisco, it is as if Blanche DuBois is saying to us, `Johnny, you are a real American, because you play football and say ch-ch-chicken.&apos;

On the musical front, the shifting from a mysterious moody orchestral score to straight-up R&B ably shows Mr. Wiseau&apos;s ability to blend different styles musically in order to create a unified mood in his movie. On the sound front, the boom operator clearly did an excellent job as half of the lines in the beginning of the movie are dubbed in later, even though the filming takes place in a quiet room with no extraneous noise.

With regards to editing, Mr. Wiseau deftly uses cutaways to 30-second-long shots from different vantage points in San Francisco. He seems to be saying to the viewer, I hope you weren&apos;t interested in the dialogue, because now you will have to sit through 30 seconds of the same shot of the Golden Gate Bridge you&apos;ve seen 10 times already, before we get back to the dramatic tension you were longing for.

Other attention to detail includes varying dates on how long Johnny and Lisa have been together (5 or 7 years), the switching from the day shots to night shots and then back to day shots on the same day, the fact that all of the men are dressed in tuxedos and decide to play football even though there is no justification for why they should be dressed in tuxedos, and using the exact same shots in the second love scene between Johnny and Lisa that are also used in the first love scene.

Overall, Mr. Wiseau has proven himself to be among the top-rank writers, directors, actors, editors, gaffers, love maker, action stars, and best boys of his generation. He has shown the ability to take any aspect of filmmaking and transcend it. He is able to take monkey poop and turn it into a well-polished turd. I hope to see many more films from Mr. Wiseau in the near future, and I hope that all of them will have Mr. Wiseau acting as well as new and better performances from the guy that played Denny (he rocks!!). To Mr. Wiseau, I say L&apos;Chaim, and let&apos;s drink to much greater Cinema to come!!",,['Drama'],"['imitating a chicken', 'breast cancer', 'unintentional humor', 'best friend', 'unintentionally funny']",2003-06-27,['Tommy Wiseau'],"['Tommy Wiseau', 'Juliette Danielle', 'Greg Sestero']",['Tommy Wiseau']
Room 237,"An exploration of various interpretations of Stanley Kubrick&apos;s horror film, The Shining (1980).","Yeah, that&apos;s right. I said comedy, and this isn&apos;t a review for the wrong film. Like most people, I went into ROOM 237 expecting a documentary on Kubrick&apos;s THE SHINING, containing various theories exploring the movie&apos;s subtext and the like. What I got was an increasingly deranged collection of ramblings and outlandish conspiracy theories from a team of crackpots and wackos.

Because ROOM 237 isn&apos;t about THE SHINING at all. Instead, it&apos;s a documentary about obsession, and how ANYTHING can be interpreted as ANYTHING given the right frame of mind. So in the course of this documentary we learn that Kubrick faked the Moon landings, that a poster of skier is in fact a minotaur, and plenty more besides.

It&apos;s all complete hogwash, of course. Yes, Kubrick added in subtle, almost subliminal things to mess with the viewer&apos;s mind; changing the carpet pattern or removing a sticker from a door. But he did that to further unsettle the viewer in what after all is a horror film. There&apos;s no more to it than that. However, the nonsense spouted in this film is actually very funny, hence my comment that this makes a great comedy indeed.",6,['Documentary'],"['navajo indian', 'arapaho indian', 'number', 'big wheel', 'tv commercial']",2012-10-26,['Rodney Ascher'],"['Bill Blakemore', 'Geoffrey Cocks', 'Juli Kearns']",['Rodney Ascher']
Rope,Two men attempt to prove they committed the perfect crime by hosting a dinner party after strangling their former classmate to death.,"What an unusual Hitchcock film... such a small cast, and the whole film consists of long takes. Before seeing this, I had heard enormously positive things about it... most of them coming from my father, who hadn&apos;t seen it for about fifteen years. I had high expectations for the film, but I must say it exceeded them. Though there are only a few cuts in this film, meaning the camera is running almost non-stop, Hitchcock makes great use of it; he manages to fit in many of his trademark angles and closeups in, without it seeming forced. At one point, the camera focuses for a minute and a half on an inanimate object with only one visible character moving back and forth near it, and he manages to drench the cut in suspense, leaving even the most calm and collected of viewers at the edge of their seat, biting their nails. Only the fewest directors could make that sequence work, and luckily Hitchcock is one of them. The plot is great. It&apos;s interesting and it develops nicely. The pacing is perfect. I was never bored for a second. The acting, oh the acting... John Dall is excellent as Brandon, the intellectually superior and very smug main character. Makes me wonder why he didn&apos;t get more roles in his career. Stewart is great, as usual. The rest of the acting is very good as well. The characters are well-written and credible. For such an unusual film, and despite the heavy feeling of watching a stage play rather than a film, it&apos;s very entertaining and effective. If for nothing else, watch this to enjoy Dall as the cold, calculating and manipulative psychopath. I recommend this to fans of Hitchcock and Stewart. 8/10",8,"['Crime', 'Drama', 'Mystery']","['long take', 'leopold loeb case', 'gay subtext', 'rope', 'murder']",1948-09-25,['Alfred Hitchcock'],"['James Stewart', 'John Dall', 'Farley Granger']","['Hume Cronyn', 'Patrick Hamilton', 'Arthur Laurents']"

The Royal Tenenbaums,The eccentric members of a dysfunctional family reluctantly gather under the same roof for various reasons.,"Wes Anderson has been the face of a new brand of comedy ever since he burst onto the scene in 1996 with Bottle Rocket. He further established himself with the 1998 hit Rushmore. The Royal Tenenbaums is considered by many to be his finest work and it is kind of hard to dispute that. This is a rich, complex movie dealing with multiple characters that all suffer from serious trouble in one way or another. Gene Hackman plays the father of a family that was once quite prominent in the world of geniuses. The oldest son Chas was a successful real estate dealer, daughter Margot became a famous playwright in the ninth grade, and youngest son Richie went on to become a great tennis player. Still, all their talent couldn&apos;t keep their father from leaving them, and now he returns to see them because he tells them he is dying.

This movie works, but not as easily as some other comedies. Being a Wes Anderson movie, the humor here is very dry and there are multiple scenes when you will ask yourself if you should be sad, angry, or laugh at the characters. The look of the movie is remarkable and it perfectly matches the feeling of each character. The acting is tremendous, especially by Hackman, as well as Ben Stiller, Gwyneth Paltrow, Luke Wilson, and Angelica Huston. The whole movie is filled with weird and quirk situations, yet it all makes sense somehow. The story gives us these people and their problems and we watch as they try to piece their life back together after being apart for so long. If you are a fan of Wes Anderson, you owe it to yourself to see this. If you aren&apos;t, it still is worth seeing, but give it some time. Watching it a second time really helped me understand the characters and the story better. It may do the same for you.",8,"['Comedy', 'Drama']","['family relationships', 'forbidden love', 'dysfunctional family', 'eccentric family', 'brother brother relationship']",2002-01-04,['Wes Anderson'],"['Gene Hackman', 'Gwyneth Paltrow', 'Anjelica Huston']","['Wes Anderson', 'Owen Wilson']"
Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer: The Movie,It&apos;s up to Santa&apos;s most famous reindeer to save the day when an evil queen conjures up a storm on Christmas.,"This is the dumbest thing I have ever seen. This is not the Rankin-Bass version by any stretch of the imagination. That was a stop-motion short that is now considered a Christmas classic. Rudolph: THE MOVIE is no where near that special. The entire package, from the animation to the characters, should never have been released in theaters. That&apos;s right, this thing was on the big screen for, like, a whopping three weeks b4 going straight to video. As I said before, the animation would be right at home on UPN&apos;s Saturday Morning Lineup right next to the New Tex Avery Show. It&apos;s not The Prince of Egypt, let&apos;s just say that. Also, what is with the army of wacky side kicks? We get a polar bear voiced by Bob Newhart (Bob, what happened?), a thumb-sucking Arctic wolf, some kareoke singing faeries who painfully narrate the story, and a penguin who wears a tuxedo (Ha! My sides!). At the very, very least they added a new element to the old legend of Rudolph with the ice queen, who is voiced by Whoopi Goldberg, but even she isn&apos;t that interesting. Plus, it&apos;s a musical. And a bad one, at that. Listening to two different people do Rudolph&apos;s speaking voice and singing vocals is hilarious, since Singing Ru is about eight octaves deeper than Speaking Ru. So basically, stay away.

Run for Cover,"Mistaken for train robbers, Matt Dow and Davey Bishop are shot at by the sheriff and his posse but they are cleared and hired as lawmen.","A rather maddening western. Apparently Paramount went all out for an oater, filming in gorgeous southwestern Colorado and Aztec ruins of northwestern New Mexico. In short, there&apos;s plenty of scenic eye candy, while if there&apos;s a studio set anywhere, I couldn&apos;t spot it. Then too, there&apos;s A-list Cagney, maybe on the aging downgrade, but still Cagney. Seems he&apos;s trying to rehabilitate young man Derek from both a leg wound and a checkered past. As the new town sheriff facing a band of outlaws, an unreliable deputy Derek, and a pack of town ruffians, he&apos;s got his work cut out.

As I see it, there&apos;s a problem with the screenplay—it&apos;s too loose and lacking in focus, rambling from one incident to the next in no particular order. Thus, neither tension nor suspense builds over time nor into the rather poorly staged climax. I suspect Paramount was trying to cater to Cagney&apos;s starring presence since he&apos;s in about every scene. He&apos;s his usual commanding self. However, that&apos;s part of the problem since Derek lacks the presence needed to create chemistry with the older, compelling man. Thus, their scenes together appear lop-sided in the extreme, and the heart of the movie fails to gel.

I guess the studio figured young Derek&apos;s wayward role was apt material for brilliant director Nick Ray, who&apos;s specialty was troubled youth, i.e. They Live By Night (1948), Knock On Any Door (1949). Then too, Ray would soon triumph in the following year&apos;s iconic youth film, Rebel Without A Cause (1955). Unfortunately, I don&apos;t see any of his usual brilliance here, and I suspect he was neutralized by the rambling script and an A-list star. Though myopic editing may have figured, as it does in the river swim which strangely lacks any sequential coherence.

All in all, the 93-minutes amounts to a disappointment given the production values and talent involved. In my view, the best parts are those lushly vivid scenes from Colorado&apos;s Rockies and rivers.",,"['Drama', 'Western']",['classical western'],1955-05-14,['Nicholas Ray'],"['James Cagney', 'Viveca Lindfors', 'John Derek']","['Winston Miller', 'Harriet Frank Jr.', 'Irving Ravetch']"

Sahara,,"The film starts in the Richmond battle (1865) where a war ship is disappeared and is gone during modern time in that an archaeologists(Matthew McConaughey,Steve Zhan and William H.Macy) are looking for treasures on Africa. A physician (Penelope Cruz ) is investigating about an illness which is killing thousands people . Then they &apos;ll take on ominous villains,evil Arabs,corrupt governments and many dangers until discover the enigmas. 

The motion picture blends adventures, unstopped action,humor,a love story,tongue in cheek,tense and is enough amusing. From the beginning to end the adventures,action-packed and the fast movement is continuous, for that the film is pretty bemusing and isn&apos;t boring in spite of the longtime, as the run is two hours and some. The starring couple(Matthew MacConaughey and Steve Zahn) make a type of ¨buddy movie¨ both are top notch and very sympathetic.Penelope Cruz is attractive and enjoyable, this is her best film. The support cast is of first range (William H.Macy,Lambert Wilson,Delroy Lindo) and are excellent. Cinematography and musical score(Clint Mansell) is magnificent and riveting. Production design (Allan Cameron) is spellbound and the Sahara outdoors are spectaculars. The final confrontation between the starring and the enemies is breathtaking and impressive. It&apos;s a run and mill action film where the comedy and the giggles united to the action make the story very agreeable and stimulating. The picture well directed by Brick Eisner obtained a lot of success and achieved important box office, it was number one in United States and Europe. It&apos;s a real blockbuster. The yarn will appeal to emotion and adventure enthusiasts . Rating: Above average.

Salon Kitty,,"Up until things got ugly, war-torn Europe must have been an interesting place to be, if we&apos;re to believe the environment presented in Salon Kitty: sex, debauchery and feasting in full force, with little care for tomorrow. Looks OK to me. The curtains open to nasty Nazi Helmut Berger overseeing medical experiments in the name of racial purity; then, in the name of the Fuhrer, he gathers an excellent sample of pretty young things to put into action an orgy of epic proportions. All this would appear to be in the name of having a good time, but their claim is that they&apos;ve got the future of their nation on their minds. Berger then subjects the ladies to degrading acts to weed out the weak; this treats the audience to scenes of intimacy with a brutish monster, a humpback, a corpulent, a gypsy and of course a Jew. Well-paid, free spirited Ingrid Thulin celebrates the war on Poland at her house of sin until Berger has it shut down. The Nazis give her new girls to work with, in the name of Adolf, but she finds them too dull and pure. Nevertheless, she goes to work, unaware that the Nazis are using the bordello to eavesdrop on their officers. Innocent upper-class recruit Teresa Ann Savoy begins to develop a relationship with officer John Steiner, unfortunately shot as a traitor after her Nazis learn of their conversations. This brings her to Berger&apos;s attention, who forces her to indulge in moral misbehavior with his wife Tina Aumont. The girls begin to revolt against the oppressive Nazis as the film concludes in a flurry of sex, death and steambaths. I can&apos;t think of any non-pornographic film that contains quite so much nudity as Salon Kitty. As accomplished in Salo with notably greater ease, Brass tries to inundate his film with enough conceptual content and political intrigue to avoid being sequestered in the nudie film ghetto . Unlike standard erotically charged cinema, it starts off slow, relying primarily on suggestion and gore. However, once Berger parades the line of young ladies into their headquarters, the sex doesn&apos;t stop. Surprisingly little of the nudity is appealing. Salon Kitty appears far more interested in the connotations of the bare flesh than in the prurient appeal of women&apos;s bodies. Some symbolism reeks of the obvious; few self-respecting filmmakers would put a shot of pigs being slaughtered early in a film about Nazi debauchery. Brass seems more at home relishing in the visual appeal than criticizing the activities. Much of the sex will not appeal to fans of straightforward erotica, or even pornography. The image of a woman humiliating a man for wearing a pubic wig may have its audience, but it&apos;s a relatively minor, fetish-inclined one.",,"['Drama', 'War']","['shaved vagina', 'sexual humiliation', 'forced to strip', 'female full frontal nudity', 'brothel']",1977-01-21,['Tinto Brass'],"['Helmut Berger', 'Ingrid Thulin', 'Teresa Ann Savoy']","['Ennio De Concini', 'Maria Pia Fusco', 'Tinto Brass']"

Samsara,"Filmed over nearly five years in twenty-five countries on five continents, and shot on seventy-millimetre film, Samsara transports us to the varied worlds of sacred grounds, disaster zones, industrial complexes, and natural wonders.","This film has tremendous power, not just from camera technique, but from the simple device of a human face steadily gazing at you. Time and time again humanity intrudes its collective face on you as life plays out across the Earth. Acceleration contrasts with contemplation; Earth rhythms overshadow human activity; no one seems to notice. 

Samsara is beautiful, bizarre, and unforgettable. As the film progressed, my convictions as to what is &apos;for real&apos; began to weaken. We may really be stuck in the same dream state. And always someone &apos;sees&apos; back at you. Or is Samsara &apos;only a movie&apos;?

Santa Claus Conquers the Martians,The Martians kidnap Santa Claus because there is nobody on Mars to give their children presents.,"I badly want to give this film a 3/10, because it is by today&apos;s standards, abysmal. However, you have to try and take this film for what it is, made way back in 1964, the world was a very different place, the height of the cold war.

It is a Christmas film, and it&apos;s of course intended for adults, so you probably would have had to have been there, it&apos;s sweet, and from a kid&apos;s perspective probably did have some degree of charm.

The music is shocking, and the acting.... I&apos;ll leave that for you. At least they opted not to make Santa a Kung Fu Master, it&apos;s all meant to be heart warming.

The Saphead,The simple-minded son of a rich financier must find his own way in the world.,"Something like The Saphead isn&apos;t what you would expect to be Buster Keaton&apos;s feature film debut. The whole thing seems too ordinary, too stagey and melodramatic to be so. This is due to the fact that The Saphead was not a Keaton-helmed project; he was suggested for the role of the rich young man Bertie by Douglas Fairbanks, who had previously played the role on Broadway.

Bertie is the first of the spoiled, clueless young man types that Keaton would later return to in The Navigator and Battling Butler. He seeks to impress a sweet young woman named Agnes by coming across as a bad boy, gambling well into the morning hours and having breakfast in the afternoon. His father confronts him about this behavior and has him cut off until he can find a job. Bertie seeks out to do just that, in the meantime winning the hand of his girl-- well, almost. During the ceremony, his sister&apos;s slimy husband Mark receives letters from his recently deceased mistress Henrietta, asking him to take care of their illegitimate child. His secret about to be revealed, he presses the letters on Bertie, breaking Agnes&apos; heart and bringing the union to an abrupt end. Fortunately, things manage to pick back up after Bertie unwittingly saves the family stock business.

While there are a few Keaton-esque moments every now and then, for the most part The Saphead is just a typical stage to film adaptation of the period. Unlike the films Keaton would later star in and direct, this picture lacks spontaneity and laughs. The action on screen never comes alive until the climax, when Keaton finally gets to jump and be thrown around as he dashes through the trading floor and saves the day. The entire movie isn&apos;t a bore, however, and there are a few humorous inter-titles and gags, but it&apos;s just doesn&apos;t have a story that seems to suit the particular talents of its main star.",7,"['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Romance']","['wedding', 'new york city', 'manhattan new york city', 'train station', 'stock exchange']",1920-09-20,"['Herbert Blaché', 'Winchell Smith']","['Edward Jobson', 'Beulah Booker', 'Edward Connelly']","['Bronson Howard', 'Victor Mapes', 'June Mathis']"

Satan&apos;s Sadists,,"The title bunch are a particularly odious motorcycle gang in this, producer / director Al Adamsons&apos; contribution to the then popular cycle of biker films. Adamson does tend to take a lot of flak for his somewhat less than slick low budget productions, but this is actually one of his better efforts. It benefits from a very enjoyable gathering of B movie regulars, both new (at the time) and old. Russ Tamblyn stars as cheerful psycho Anchor, leader of this gang. Anchor and company terrorize the customers at a diner / service station, and end up pursuing some of them into the remote California wilderness. This movie lets you know right off the bat just how depraved its antagonists are, as they help themselves to an unwilling woman and then send her, her boyfriend, and their car over the edge of a cliff. When they happen upon a group of college age gals out in the desert, they drug them and have their way with them. They just can&apos;t get their comeuppance soon enough. Also among the cast are Scott Brady as weary cop Charlie, Kent Taylor as the diner proprietor Lew, Regina Carrol (Adamsons&apos; real life partner) as biker mama Gina, Jacqueline Cole as comely waitress Tracy, Gary Kent as nice guy former soldier Johnny, and John &apos;Bud&apos; Cardos, Robert Dix, Greydon Clark (who himself became a director years later), William Bonner, and Bobby Clark as the gang. Carrols&apos; slutty dance number inside the diner rates as a highlight, as do the fight sequences between Tamblyn & Cardos and Kent & Cardos. The soundtrack is quite good, with Harley Hatcher composing both the songs and the score. The prolific Gary Graver serves as both the editor and cinematographer (assisted in the latter capacity by an uncredited Vilmos Zsigmond). The makeup artist is a young Susan Arnold (daughter of the great sci-fi director Jack Arnold), who went on to great success as a casting director and, eventually, a producer. But it&apos;s really Tamblyns&apos; scenery devouring performance that makes this worth seeing; he even came up with a monologue on his own. As far as biker films go, this definitely has to be one of the trashiest ones ever made, and it&apos;s nothing if not amusing for its entire 87 minute running time. It&apos;s rough, crude, and suitably rousing, and the sleaze just oozes off of the screen.

Saturday Morning Massacre,"A dark and bloody parody about a Scooby-Doo-like team of paranormal investigators and their devoted dog. With the crew nearing bankruptcy, they&apos;re hired to get to the bottom of a series of spooky events at the remote Kyser mansion...","As a horror film Saturday Morning Mystery is nothing special. It&apos;s not particularly scary or innovative in the &apos;who, what and how&apos;. The bit that IS innovative is the use of an ersatz version of the gang from Scooby Doo... and that is the film&apos;s only real talking point. It lives or dies by how well that is pulled off. Sadly it&apos;s a mixed bag of nuts. The first half is great, I enjoyed seeing the real-life version of the characters I watched as a kid... worrying over having no real source of income, having to deal with the police, uncovering criminals whose motives are a bit nastier than &apos;old man Geezer trying to keep kids away from his gold&apos;. They run into a few quirky characters (what&apos;s up with the couple in the diner?) and a haunted house with a bad history. So yeah, the setup is fun. Naturally, I favored the &apos;Velma&apos; character Nancy. She&apos;s brave, perky and smart just like she oughtta be. 

To my mind the movie took a turn for the worse when the obligatory &apos;Shaggy&apos;-induced drug sequence goes down. It took me a moment to realize what was going on and somehow it just didn&apos;t sit well. It felt forced... or something. After that, and the equally obligatory &apos;Fred&apos; and &apos;Daphne&apos; sex scene it felt like the writers had shot their wad. 

The trick of the movie is that it tries to go where Scooby Doo never went... where, as a kid, I always wanted it to go, by giving the kids some REAL monsters to uncover. Unfortunately this is where it pretty much completely drops the Scooby Doo setup and goes straight into &apos;coeds meet rabid hillbilly&apos; territory. There are no surprises or interesting moments from this point on that haven&apos;t been seen in dozens of other fright flicks. I have a larger issue with horror films in general that throw up their hands when it&apos;s time to get scary and resort to just chopping up the cast rather than coming up with more creative ways to say &apos;BOO!&apos;. Death and dismemberment are nasty but a lot can be said for more subtle character-based scares as well. The monsters in Saturday Morning Mystery just are not worthy of their adversaries. For one thing they bear no resemblance to the ersatz spooks the cartoon gang had to thwart... which is fine, but they&apos;re not a particularly interesting pack of ghouls in any other way either. They&apos;re just there to sneak around in the background and then leap out and kill. Not surprisingly the kids on their own are much more fun to watch. 

There is a confused attempt to do the signature &apos;hallway chase scene&apos; that was often in the old cartoons... but if it was meant to be funny it wasn&apos;t.

Really, if it weren&apos;t for the first 45 minutes or so of this movie it wouldn&apos;t even be worth a discussion because it would be just another slasher flick.",5,['Horror'],"['blood', 'dog', 'female nudity', 'male nudity', 'police officer']",2012-06-16,['Spencer Parsons'],"['Jonny Mars', 'Josephine Decker', 'Adam Wyatt Tate']","['Kat Candler', 'Jonny Mars', 'Jason Wehling']"

My only advice after watching it is, if this film held a special place in your heart when you were a kid like me, is leave it there. It does not stand up to the test of time.

A lack of star names helps the movie flow as the pace builds to a finale that won&apos;t be forgotten by this viewer in a hurry! 

I still can&apos;t sleep. 

It is well scripted, well acted, and, for everyone who guesses the killer after the first few minutes, keeps you guessing right up to the final reel. It is better than Seven for shock value. It is not over the top gory but there is a final scene which makes you sweat.

Shiriusu no densetsu,A prince of the sea and a child of fire engage in a tragic forbidden romance.,"I saw this on either HBO or Showtime in the early 80&apos;s (As the legend of Sirius) and was entranced by it. The story is a retelling of Romeo and Juliette, though with a happier ending (Not a difficult feat). It also reminds me greatly (especially Ursula) of Disney&apos;s &apos;The Little Mermaid&apos;, though that came much later (And wasn&apos;t as good). The final battle between Posideon and &apos;Ursula&apos; (A very different beast that I can&apos;t remember the actual name of) is better than Disney&apos;s offering, including the animation.

Our hero Sirius, a water child, falls in love with Marta, a fire child. In the english translation, they were Prince and Princess, respectively though that doesn&apos;t affect the storyline much. Friends are lost, and other sacrifices are made in the name of true love, then....well, can&apos;t give away the ending.",,"['Animation', 'Drama', 'Family']","['romeo and juliet plot', 'fairy', 'anime animation', 'fire', 'water']",1982-09-08,['Masami Hata'],"['Tôru Furuya', 'Mami Koyama', 'Ikue Sakakibara']","['Shintarô Tsuji', 'Masami Hata', 'Chiho Katsura']"

It is so good that it makes me want to see it all over again, but I can&apos;t.

It is a film all about employees on a spaceship who have to find their friend called Spock. After they search the spaceship they start to look all over the universe for him. There is a lot of tension in this film that made me bite my nails off. Where is Spock? Where could he be? Sometimes they think they have found him but it turns out to be somebody else, which is very exciting.

This film is even more exciting than riding your bicycle at high speeds, and the space scenes and special effects are even better than what real space actually looks like.

The Searchers,An American Civil War veteran embarks on a years-long journey to rescue his niece from the Comanches after the rest of his brother&apos;s family is massacred in a raid on their Texas farm.,"About ten minutes into the film, there is a shot which begins with Captain Clayton (Ward Bond) slamming a door behind two children who were teasing two young lovers, Lucy and Brad. There follows a wordless interior shot, lasting maybe a minute, wherein Aunt Martha takes out Ethan&apos;s Confederate overcoat, tenderly caressing it before she hands it to Ethan. I noticed the sequence when I recently watched the film again, and I had to rewind and play it once more because I found it so stunning--all of the information and emotions conveyed without a word. I&apos;d watched the film previously maybe a dozen times and had never noticed the power of this sequence.

Don&apos;t for a second tell me that Ethan is a stereotype, because there is so much more at work here. Obviously we are not supposed to sympathize with Ethan&apos;s prejudices, but notice that Ethan is not the only one who feels that way. Laurie (not at all disapprovingly) tells Martin that Aunt Martha would have preferred her daughter to be killed after being defiled. Interestingly, Martin is one-eighth Cherokee, which under the old racial percentages of the Confederacy would make him the equivalent of an octoroon, and therefore non-white. Martin&apos;s intended marriage to Laurie, on racial terms, would have been as taboo as Debbie marrying Scar: Laurie believes that death is preferable for Debbie, but she intends to do likewise with Martin. The contrast is that Debbie was abducted, whereas Laurie would willingly go. And note at the end that Laurie walks right by Debbie, as she heads for Martin.

The final shot is famous, but I noted the doorway theme throughout the film: the message of an open or closed door, whether the character enters the door or just looks in, at other times, the character is inside looking out. And all of this in a 50&apos;s western.

The movie is not perfect: I could have done without some of the comic relief. However, this is John Wayne&apos;s best work (The Shootist is a close second). Those who think this is the best film of all time have good reason to support their belief.",10,"['Adventure', 'Drama', 'Western']","['revenge', 'tough guy', 'navajo indian', 'ambush', 'violence']",1956-05-26,['John Ford'],"['John Wayne', 'Jeffrey Hunter', 'Vera Miles']","['Frank S.

Secretary,"A young woman, recently released from a mental hospital, gets a job as a secretary to a demanding lawyer, where their employer-employee relationship turns into a sexual, sadomasochistic one.","This one was really a pleasant surprise.

Maggie Gyllenhaal is wonderful. I think this is easily my favorite role of hers. She&apos;s funny, adorable, and sexy. James Spader&apos;s great but Maggie really makes the movie something special.

Obviously not for all tastes but I would say that you should try it out, even if the BDSM stuff doesn&apos;t float your boat. I think you&apos;ll be surprised at how much you like it. One thing that I would like to address is that I see a lot of other reviewers who liked the movie saying they hated the ending. Gotta say I can&apos;t disagree more with this. I assume these people would have preferred a more downbeat ending. Frankly, that would have ruined the whole experience for me and I would have subtracted points from my score.

See No Evil,"A group of delinquents are sent to clean the Blackwell Hotel. Little do they know reclusive psychopath Jacob Goodnight has holed away in the rotting hotel. When one of the teens is captured, those who remain - a group that include...","Eight teen convicts are brought to the abandoned Blackwell Hotel to clean it out as community service. They soon discover that it&apos;s the residence of a hulking psychopath (Kane) who has a thing for pulling out and collecting eyeballs. It doesn&apos;t help that the guard watching over them (Steven Vidler) has had a previous run-in with the beast four years earlier. 

A guilty pleasure of mine are slasher films. Most of them are poorly directed and acted but they still hold some appeal and entertainment value. See No Evil is a good example of this. It features atrocious writing and acting but the death scenes are pretty good and the movie proves to be entertaining. The premise sounds like a mixture between Friday the 13th, Saw 2 and Halloween: Resurrection. I really liked the idea but it didn&apos;t work out too well. It was really just a bunch of clichés and everything was predictable. Screenwriter Dan Madigan just focused on the death scenes and nothing else apparently. The death scenes themselves are pretty good and gruesome. Director Gregory Dark did a good job with them and he came up with some creative kills. 

The acting is pretty bland and unremarkable. This is because all of the characters are one dimensional and we don&apos;t know much about them. It was hard to feel for these people because they were pretty unlikable. Kane is surprisingly mediocre. I was expecting his on screen presence to be scarier but he didn&apos;t do that good of a job. A second rate Jason Voorhees, if you will. The rest of the actors are relatively unknown and this film will probably neither help nor hurt their careers. 

While the death scenes are gory, they aren&apos;t necessary scary. There&apos;s really no suspense just some gory death scenes. Because of this, the movie doesn&apos;t hold much of a repeat value. Also, if you don&apos;t like slasher films then don&apos;t waste your time with this one. It will do little to change your opinion. In the end, See No Evil is a decent slasher film but it is generic and forgettable so it&apos;s not exactly worth watching.

Emma Thompson has done a fine job of the script, not slavishly remaining faithful to the book but not abandoning it either.

The cast are uniformally excellent. I especially liked Kate Winslet&apos;s Marianne and Alan Rickman&apos;s Brandon. Emma Thompson&apos;s performance is almost good enough to make you forget that she is far to old for the part. The supporting cast are all excellent.

Ang Lee&apos;s direction shows the same skill that it did in the excellent Eat Drink Man Woman and the scenery and costumes are beautiful (perhaps too beautiful).

This is more romantic and less comic than say Emma, and Thompson&apos;s script wisely stays away from the kind of set-piece gags seen in the recent film of Emma.

The Serpent and the Rainbow,An anthropologist goes to Haiti after hearing rumors about a drug used by black magic practitioners to turn people into zombies.,"It is interesting to think what could have been of this movie. What we get is almost worthless but with enough to actually imagine it in better hands.

The original story, reportedly based on facts, about a white man&apos;s encounter with a strange, exotic culture and how small and ill-prepared he discovers himself to be in the density of that jungle calls for a mystical gaze, an earnest way of accepting worlds beyond. The author of that story wanted Peter Weir for the project, for good reason. Instead he got Wes Craven, who probably qualified based on the nightmares he concocted for the Elms Street movie but who is completely out of his depth here.

The result is an overkill of garish voodoo ceremony and hysteric hallucinations inside coffins. Craven piles so much frenzy upon it that whatever serious intentions existed behind the material are completely lost in it.

There&apos;s a political commentary with some bite to it; about the chief of secret police who is also a voodoo priest, making sure that people remain prisoners of their bodies inside their own minds, frightened, subservient drones. Like the military regime he serves.

The rest? The rest is impossible to take serious. The finale is particularly stupid, with people flying out of walls and a fistfight.

The situation has promise. A way of shutting people off inside their own minds, removing them from reality so that they see without seeing. Which may be conditioned superstition or more, about communion with something beyond. And about the American disbeliever eventually succumbing to this. Interesting things to play around with.

Peter Weir could have made something great with this, the movie seems tailored to his world. Perhaps he did already with The Last Wave, about white man&apos;s encounter with a mystical Aboriginal culture which, shuttering his safe notions about reality, brings him to the yawning brink of apocalypse.

I love Weir but he has his limitations. Sometimes his visions of that otherness are too tawdry, or wistfully naive. Noble savages and magical gnomes abound. The other filmmaker I would love to see make this movie is Werner Herzog with his Wagnerian romance about tragic monomaniacs battling vast, inscrutable natures. A brief glimpse of the cosmic as a revelation of individual madness and folly.

Skip this and go straight for The Year of Living Dangerously or Cobra Verde, where the encounters with the other reveal things. Or if you&apos;re specifically interested in the voodoo zombie, go further back for I Walked with a Zombie.",,"['Fantasy', 'Horror']","['haiti', 'voodoo', 'haitian voodoo', 'ritual', 'surrealism']",1988-02-05,['Wes Craven'],"['Bill Pullman', 'Cathy Tyson', 'Zakes Mokae']","['Wade Davis', 'Richard Maxwell', 'Adam Rodman']"

I&apos;m not sure if classify this so much as a horror, I see it more as a psychological thriller, and a truly good one at that. If I&apos;m totally honest, I didn&apos;t fully understand all that was happening, but on a second viewing it made more sense.

I see a degree of originality here, it&apos;s far from a run of the mill film.

Duvall attempts a British accent but fails miserably (probably why he has hardly anything to say within this movie). Williamson and Arkin are great and there is a lot of pleasure to be had from their interpretations of these great characters. Laurence Olivier, however, as Moriarty is dreadful and clearly just turning in a performance by numbers for the cheque.

The Seven Year Itch,"When his family goes away for the summer, a hitherto faithful husband with an overactive imagination is tempted by a beautiful neighbor.","In the &apos;fifties Hollywood created its biggest, best-loved and most powerful sex symbol of allMarilyn Monroe 

Marilyn&apos;s appeal was, perhaps, in her weakness, in that revealing look of innocence and confidence, in her intense desire to be loved 

The &apos;seven year itch&apos; points out the instinctive desire to be disloyal after seven years of matrimony, with a longing to satisfy one&apos;s sexual needs 

This amusing film was adapted from a Broadway play of the same name by George Axelrod, with Tom Ewell reprising his Broadway role, walking, worrying, and sweating 

Tom and Evelyn Kayes have been married for seven years While he remains in Manhattan on business, Evelyn and their son Ricky (Butch Bernard) go off to Maine to escape the sweltering summer 

The apartment upstairs has been rented to a television blonde model (Marilyn Monroe). When she forgot her front door key, she had to ring Ewell&apos;s bell to let her into the building 

When Marilyn accidentally knocks a tomato plant onto Tom&apos;s terrace, the happily man invites the luscious young beauty downstairs for a drink, indulging in fantasies about taking her in his arms and kissing her &apos;very quickly and very hard&apos; 

Marilyn comes in, explaining that she feels safe with married men... He makes a clumsy pass while they are at the piano but both fall off the seat He stammers an apology, but she pretends it is nothing

When Marilyn returns to her apartment, Tom envisions his wife having an affair in Maine with their big neighbor, Tom McKenzie (Sonny Tufts) Then he sees himself lost between foolish fantasies of seduction, and terrible ideas of his wife capturing him in action Finally he decides to put an end to his visions and asks Marilyn out to a movie... 

On their way home, they stop on a subway 

As the trains go by underneath, Marilyn&apos;s skirts billow up 

It is so hot in the city she presumably loves the rush of air on her thighs 

Marilyn plays the scene in innocent delight And Billy Wilder&apos;s shot shows a strapping blonde with a white skirt blown out like a spinnaker above her waist

Sexy Beast,,"A fantastic British gangster movie that goes for authenticity over &apos;Mockney&apos; laughs. Continuing where &apos;Performance&apos; left off (it even features James Fox) this movie has stand-out performances from all of it&apos;s cast, with Ben Kingsley (as Don Logan) producing the scariest bad-guy in cinema since Dennis Hopper&apos;s &apos;Frank&apos;. Ray Winstone & Amanda Redmond are perfectly cast, with Winstone flinching superbly from the terrifying aggression exuded by Kingsley and, to a lesser extent, McShane. Ian McShane does a lot to bury his lightweight &apos;Lovejoy&apos; persona with an excellent, menacing performance that contrasts well against Winstone&apos;s thin bravado, but the honours here have to go to Kingsley who is simply stunning, turning in a masterclass performance and proving (once again) that he is a top-drawer actor with every aspect of his character (posture; accent; attitude) finally honed and utterly (appallingly) convincing.

Kingsley&apos;s scenes set the movie alight (like the stunning airport sequence, and of course the return to the villa) and it would be interesting to know just how much of the dialogue comes from the excellent script and how much (if any) was improvised. These more aggressive sections are beautifully contrasted by the &apos;slower&apos; character building sections, which allow Winstone to display his charm to full affect.

Shadow of a Doubt,,"Shadow of a Doubt is perhaps Hitchcock&apos;s first real masterpiece - a more mature film than The 39 Steps or Rebecca. It is also incidentally his favorite of his own films. The sleepy town of Santa Rosa is far removed from the very real events of WW-2, events that figured at least a mention if not a central influence on most films of that period. Hitchcock&apos;s Rear Window and Vertigo were also far removed from the realities of the Cold War and the Communist Witch-Hunts of the 50&apos;s.

Shadow is taut with sexual tension - the incestuous overtones of the mental affinity of niece and uncle Charlie, the lusty infatuations of Charlie&apos;s teenage friend Catherine, and Herb, who just happens to be around the corner where ever we see Charlie. Charlie, the niece, is played by Teresa Wright in one of Hitchcock&apos;s best female performances. She is very warm, innocent and genuinely good-natured - completely unlike Hitch&apos;s usual icy blonds. I have always found Joseph Cotten to be quite inexpressive. He is slightly better than his usual self and is believable in charming and winning over the small town-folk.

This is probably Hitchcock&apos;s only film with a strong human core, coupled with his well-known skills as a master technician.

Of Love and Shadows,"Chile 1973 is ruled by the dictator Pinochet. The wealthy don&apos;t see the violence, terror, executions etc. including Irene. She&apos;s engaged to an officer in the fascist military. She meets Francisco who opens her eyes to truth and love.","Having read the novel, I was curious to see how it would be made into a film. I had high hopes, because the book was extremely poignant and well-written. However, these hopes were dashed within the first five minutes of this truly awful movie.

Now, I&apos;m a fan of both Antonio Banderas and Jennifer Connelly. I think they&apos;re great actors. However, Of Love and Shadows brought out the worst in both. The acting was hideous and essentially consisted of Jennifer Connelly using an awful accent while making bedroom eyes at Antionio Banderas, who did the same (but with a much better accent).

Aside from the terrible performances, the real flaw of this film was that it tried to incorporate too much of the book into too small a time frame. There is a good deal of fantastic material in the book, but there is simply too much to be done on screen. What seems to have happened is that the makes didn&apos;t exactly realize this and consequently tried to hold on to too many secondary characters and too many story lines. The result was less than satisfactory. I was entirely convinced that anyone who hadn&apos;t read the book before seeing the movie would have been completely lost.

In short, I seriously pity Isabel Allende for this horribly botched movie which is entirely unrepresentative of the excellent book she wrote. Do not watch this movie.

The Shallows,,"The Shallows (2016) 

*** (out of 4) 

Nancy (Blake Lively) heads to a secluded beach in Mexico that her mother had visited years earlier. The plan is to surf and reflect on her life but soon she&apos;s fighting for it when she&apos;s attacked by a Great White shark.

THE SHALLOWS has been called the best shark movie since JAWS and it&apos;s easy to see why so many people are falling in love with it. Director Jaume Collet-Serra has certainly created one of the more memorable thrillers of the past few years and while there&apos;s a lot of scenes with the shark the director also manages to build up suspense without seeing it. This is certainly a movie where the director has full control of the experience and he really delivers a nice little gem.

The greatest thing about the movie is certainly it&apos;s suspense factor. Going into the movie you already know that there&apos;s a shark that is going to attack so this immediately gets you ready for what&apos;s to come. What works so well is the fact that everything goes as you&apos;d expect but at the thirty minute mark things take a bigger turn and we get several more twists and surprises. I&apos;m obviously not going to ruin them here but there&apos;s no doubt that there are several scenes that will have your stomach in a knot as you wait to see where the next attack is going to come from.

The director delivers all sorts of great excitement and there&apos;s no doubt that the shark attacks are wonderfully done. What&apos;s so great about them is that the shark looks 100% real and there&apos;s never any feeling that you&apos;re watching a CGI shark like DEEP BLUE SEA or some other crap movie you&apos;d see on SyFy. The movie also works whenever the shark isn&apos;t attacking because the director builds up such a relationship between the viewer and the Nancy character that you can&apos;t help but feel suspense even when the shark isn&apos;t there.

Lively turns in a very good performance as she perfectly hits on several emotional marks. Oscar Jaenada also deserves a lot of credit for the few scenes that he is in. There are a few flaws here and there, including a horrible ending but there&apos;s no question that THE SHALLOWS delivers the goods.",,"['Action', 'Drama', 'Horror']","['shark attack', 'shark', 'female protagonist', 'killer shark', 'beach']",2016-06-24,['Jaume Collet-Serra'],"['Blake Lively', 'Óscar Jaenada', 'Angelo Josue Lozano Corzo']",['Anthony Jaswinski']
Shane,"A weary gunfighter in 1880s Wyoming begins to envision a quieter life after befriending a homestead family with a young son who idolizes him, but a smoldering range war forces him to act.","No need to echo consensus points from 300 reviews. What follows is my brief effort at characterizing the movie&apos;s important social subtext.

Besides the first-rate cast, majestic scenery, and excellent script, few Westerns capture the mythic history of the West better than Shane. The battle is really one between two types of society. The Rykers represent a feudal type with their land baron ownership of huge swaths of as yet barren land. I&apos;m glad the script includes struggles they&apos;ve had in taming the territory for their huge cattle-grazing purposes. It&apos;s not like they&apos;ve sacrificed nothing for their dominant position. No doubt it would have been easy for the film to portray them as unadulterated bad guys.

On the other hand, The Starretts and their neighbors may be squatters on the land, but they represent a different future, one of broad settlement, farming pastures, and cooperative community. In short, they&apos;re a communal threat to the Strykers dominance. That&apos;s shown in their family gatherings, common purpose, and common desire to come together; that is, if they can resist The Strykers&apos; effort to drive them apart. Actor Heflin&apos;s dad Starrett represents this resolve and dedication to the community dream, as well as a strong sense of personal morals, which are just the sort needed in order to lead the transition. He has the guts, but does he have the skills, and that&apos;s where Shane comes in.

Of course, it&apos;s Shane and little Joey that represent the drama&apos;s appealing heart. In short, Shane amounts to the vital transition figure between the old and the new. As a gunfighter, he&apos;s a product of the open range of the Starretts, but as an exceptional man who&apos;s sampled the Starrett&apos;s family life he senses the need for constructive change and is willing to risk his life for it. Meanwhile, Joey, in a meaningful sense, represents the power of Shane&apos;s enduring norms, which Joey will no doubt carry into his own and the town&apos;s future. Ironically, however, Shane realizes that his strength is also an unintentional threat to the Starrett&apos;s cohesion as a family unit-- mom (Arthur) is attracted to him, while he&apos;s replacing dad as Joey&apos;s adult model. Thus, in the celebrated closing, Shane must ride away into an uncertain future, his contribution to civilizing the West his lasting legacy. At the same time, Joey will chase after the hope of somehow being the good man&apos;s equal in his coming years. And our last shot is Shane as he rides toward the majestic peaks he has now earned. Thus concrete events in the film transform into a spirit of the new West.

Anyway, this is my take on what I think is the film&apos;s powerful subtext embodied in characters and events. All in all, the movie was a critical hit when I was a kid, and I think it still is.",,"['Drama', 'Western']","['settler', 'wyoming', 'drifter', 'bar fight', 'target practice']",1953-08-14,['George Stevens'],"['Alan Ladd', 'Jean Arthur', 'Van Heflin']","['A.B.

Shark Tale,,"After seeing the opening today I have to admit...Shark&apos;s Tale was one of the corniest movie I&apos;ve seen in my life...CORNY to the bone. The plot was awesome, and I had laughs, but the writers really tried too hard to make this movie too funny, and they&apos;re going to lose international credibility for it...a whole lot. 

Let me give you a Jamaican perspective. I&apos;m not taking anything from Ziggy Marley (Ernie) & Doug E. Doug (Bernie); they both couldn&apos;t have done the &apos;Jellyfish Rastas Duo&apos; roles better. But seriously now, both roles were controversially laced with cuss words taken from the Jamaican dialect (thankfully that most Americans don&apos;t understand). And so, I felt quite embarrassed listening to the context in how it was done. I&apos;m proud of my Jamaican culture and dialect and that many people would love to learn & experience it. But the writers just can&apos;t incorporate cuss words into a kid&apos;s movie like that. 

It might be funny to some, but it also sends a negative message to the younger audience about different cultures.

She Freak,Claire Brennen stars as a waitress who leaves the greasy-diner business for the excitement of the carnival. She quickly discovers that she despises freaks and human oddities.,"Bored diner waitress Jade (Claire Brennen) joins the carnival in search of excitement, where she quickly worms her way into the affections of wealthy freak show manager Steve St. John (Bill McKinney), the carnival&apos;s most eligible bachelor. After a whirlwind romance, and a short engagement, the pair get married, but it&apos;s not long before Jade is out seeking thrills with loutish ferris wheel foreman Blackie (Lee Raymond), who happily gives her a ride for free. When Steve learns from pal Shorty that his wife is banging Blackie, he confronts the uncouth carnie, only to get a knife in the belly for his troubles. As a result, delighted Jade inherits her late husband&apos;s lucrative business, but her hatred and mistreatment of the sideshow&apos;s exhibits means it not long before the ruthless ex-waitress gets served her just desserts.

She Freak, a virtual remake of Tod Browning&apos;s 30s horror classic Freaks, opens with a solid five and a half minutes of carnival footage—shot after tedious shot of carnies plying their trade to happy punters—before eventually getting down to telling a story. Throughout the film, director Byron Mabe continues to make maximum usage of his carnival setting, regularly interrupting the action with further prolonged shots of people risking their lives on rather precarious looking fairground rides while eating unwholesome food purchased from dodgy concession stands. Strip this excess of colourful padding from this cheapo drive-in garbage and there really isn&apos;t a whole lot left—certainly nothing to get your average exploitation/horror fan excited about.

Considering the film was produced by trashmeister David F. Friedman, whose filmography boasts such legendary titles as Blood Feast, Two Thousand Maniacs!, Ilsa: She Wolf of the SS, and Love Camp 7, it should come as no surprise to find that, in terms of style and atmosphere, She Freak is no match for the masterpiece that inspired it; however, it is rather shocking to discover that the film is remarkably light on both sleaze and gore. The bloodletting is limited to an unconvincing screwdriver through the hand during a fight between carnies and there is no sex or nudity to speak of (unless you count off-screen nookie and a few brief glimpses of skin from sexy sideshow stripper Moon, played by Lynn Courtney). Worse still, the film&apos;s genuine &apos;freaks&apos; are limited to one dwarf (Felix Silla, Twiki from Buck Rogers), a sword swallower, and a June Whitfield lookalike who plays with snakes—no match for the collection of genuinely disturbing human oddities that helped make Tod Browning&apos;s Freaks such a memorable movie.",4,['Horror'],"['waitress', 'carnival', 'freak', 'psychotronic film', 'exploitation']",1967-05-03,"['Byron Mabe', 'Donn Davison']","['Claire Brennen', 'Lee Raymond', 'Lynn Courtney']","['David F.

The Shining,"A family heads to an isolated hotel for the winter where a sinister presence influences the father into violence, while his psychic son sees horrific forebodings from both past and future.","What can I say about the scariest movie I have ever seen that has not already been said by others more articulate than yours truly? Do not view this film expecting to see a screen version of the Stephen King novel. Rather, this is a Stanley Kubrick film, and to fully appreciate it one should judge it within the context of Kubrick&apos;s entire body of work as a serious filmmaker. Thematically, THE SHINING relates most closely to 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, though flourishes of PATHS OF GLORY, A CLOCKWORK ORANGE and BARRY LYNDON do manage to figure prominently in the film&apos;s overall technique.

In a nutshell (no pun intended), Jack Nicholson and Shelly Duvall co-star with Oregon&apos;s Timberline Lodge - enlisted to portray the exterior of the Overlook Hotel - in a story that appears on the surface to be about ghosts and insanity, but deals with issues of child abuse, immortality and duality. 

What the film might lack initially in terms of coherence is more than made up for in technique. Garrett Brown (the male voice in those old Molson Golden commercials), inventor of the Steadicam, chases young Danny Lloyd through hotel corridors and an amazing snow maze, providing magic-carpet-ride fluidity to scenes that ten years earlier would have been impossible to accomplish. If the film starts off too slow, remember who the director is. This man likes to take his time, and the results are well worth it: incredible aerial shots of the Overlook Hotel; horrific Diane Arbus-inspired twins staring directly at us; portentous room 237 and its treasure trove of terrible secrets; elevators that gush rivers of blood in slow-motion; Jack Torrance&apos;s immortality found via the hotel (akin to David Bowman&apos;s journey through the Space Gate); and some of the best use of pre-existing music ever assembled for a motion picture.

It would take a book to examine and defend the film&apos;s strong points and drawbacks. If you&apos;ve never seen it, you owe it to yourself to watch it alone with the lights off, with no interruptions, and make sure that it&apos;s raining. This is a cinematic experience that changed my life at the age of 14.

The Shootist,A dying gunfighter spends his last days looking for a way to die with a minimum of pain and a maximum of dignity.,"This was John Wayne&apos;s last film, and it sees the Duke as an aging, ailing but still tough as steel gunslinger named John Bernard Books. Wayne&apos;s character rides into town at the start of the film and visits James Stewart&apos;s pleasant Doc Hostetler, who tells him that he has terminal cancer and will die within two months. After this, Wayne goes and rents a room with widow Lauren Bacall, and begins to reflect on his situation, trying to figure a way to die retaining the dignity he has fought all his life to keep unscathed. 

The film is a particularly appropriate one for Wayne&apos;s last picture. The protagonist he plays is a man at the top of his profession with nowhere left to go. Any opponent who has ever fought him has died at the end of Books&apos; barrel; but now, he is fighting an enemy he cannot hope to face and beat like a man. Whatever he does to fight the cancer, it will just take him anyway. And so, Books searches for a way to go down fighting and to die with dignity, not dying a slow crippling death in his bed. 

Books is a character that has many faults. He is a man who has killed thirty men and shows no remorse. As he puts it himself, `I never killed a man who didn&apos;t deserve it&apos;. However, despite all his faults, he shows himself to a gentleman of the old school. He is like a knight in armour transplanted to the last days of the Wild West, trying hard to keep all the old values of a dignity and honour alive. He is a man who lives by a code which he believes in, and which he applies to others: `I won&apos;t be wronged, I won&apos;t be insulted, and I won&apos;t be laid a hand on. I don&apos;t do these things to other people, and I require the same from them.&apos;

There is no real villain in this film. Books, with all his flaws, is not a bad man. The real villains here are the ordinary people who are all around him in the city, willing to exploit him and use his fame, illness and even his death to further their own wealth. The whole town, from reporters to undertakers, are only too eager to exploit him, with only a few good people being an exception to this tragic rule.

There is no mistaking that this is the Duke&apos;s final picture, and not anybody else&apos;s film. It is his persona and his charisma that carries and controls the film. The character of Books  a rough, tough, but by no means bad, man  is very much similar to that of Wayne&apos;s own and this film is essentially a vehicle allowing him to have a dramatic swansong befitting a star of his magnitude. 

That isn&apos;t to say, however, that the others involved with this don&apos;t pull their weight. Lauren Bacall delivers well up to her usual standard of acting, presenting a character both strong-spirited and tenderly gentle at once, something which she does extremely well. Ron Howard also acquits himself admirably as her son, turning in a performance which has the same strength and heart as that of his screen-mother Bacall. James Stewart turns in a powerful cameo, adding to the overall poignancy of the whole affair, and Harry Morgan turns in a repellent performance as the contemptible Marshal Thibado. Dirty Harry director Don Seigel directs with skill and ensures that the film remains poignant, but never sentimental. For a western, this film does not have a great deal of action, but such is the quality of acting, direction and scriptwriting, that this doesn&apos;t really matter. When the violence does erupt, however, it is occasionally graphic but always exciting. The film&apos;s climactic gunfight is a particular highlight and is one of the Duke&apos;s best shoot-outs.

This is a powerful, entertaining and enjoyable film, regardless; however, it is further ennobled by it being the Duke&apos;s final performance. There is something curiously heart-warming about the whole affair, not least the fact that he is enabled to go out in such great style. This is a must for fans of the western genre, for fans of the Duke, or for anyone who just wants to see a well made, poignant film. Highly recommended.

Short Cuts,The day-to-day lives of several suburban Los Angeles residents.,"A classic bit of Altman - the story of cross-cutting lives over several days in LA. Featuring an all-star cast featuring a host of great character actors including Tim Robins, Julianne Moore, Jennifer Jason Leigh to name a few.

The performances are wonderful without exception (even Andie McDowell does OK). The intertwining stories are interesting up until the end - three hours goes past almost effortlessly and unnoticed. My only problem with the film is the lack of any real emotional punch or meaning in all of the stories. The majority of the stories have the potential for strong emotions to draw the audience in but the majority don&apos;t let it out too much (like real life I suppose), the one story that does let the characters feel (the story of McDowell&apos;s child) is not that convincing. Some of the stories don&apos;t make a lot of sense and don&apos;t feel based in reality. Compared to Magnolia, Glengarry Glen Ross, 12 Angry Men and other ensemble pieces this engages on an interest level but lacks an emotional involvement. I know that this is often on critic&apos;s top-ten lists but I felt that interesting stories and great acting do not make up for the lack of an emotional centre to the film. And the conclusion makes very little sense in relation to one of the stories in particular.",,"['Comedy', 'Drama']","['waitress', 'destruction of property', 'marriage crisis', 'cheating husband', 'redheaded woman']",1993-10-01,['Robert Altman'],"['Andie MacDowell', 'Julianne Moore', 'Tim Robbins']","['Raymond Carver', 'Robert Altman', 'Frank Barhydt']"

All told, I&apos;d probably rate this movie a C-/C.",5,['Horror'],"['carnival freak', 'freak show', 'fortune teller', 'carnival', 'breasts']",,['Fred Olen Ray'],"['Jamie Martz', 'Michael Amos', 'Scott McCann']",['Neal Marshall Stevens']
The Sign of the Cross,A Roman soldier becomes torn between his love for a Christian woman and his loyalty to Emperor Nero.,"Rome - First Century A. D. Nero, the mad Emperor & Poppaea, his vile Empress, engage in every sort of vice & degradation. Wanton cruelty becomes a spectator sport and virtue & innocence are denigrated. Slowly, however, a new Power is growing. People calling themselves Christians are secretly spreading their Faith ever more widely. They are horribly persecuted, but they continue to multiply. Which will eventually triumph - the might of Imperial Rome, or the gentle ones who follow THE SIGN OF THE CROSS?

This Cecil B. DeMille epic is a vivid retelling of the struggles of the first Christians. Paramount gave the film a lavish production and DeMille wrings every drop of piety & puerile interest possible from the plot. Fredric March is stalwart as the Roman official who falls in love with a beautiful Christian girl. While his ultimate conversion wouldn&apos;t convince the average modern Baptist, he holds his own in scenes with other performers whom are allowed to behave outrageously. Elissa Landi is sweet as the virtuous Believer, effectively underplaying her role.

`Do you want to play the most wicked woman in the world?&apos; DeMille asked Claudette Colbert one day on the studio lot. She did & she does memorably, from her eye-popping milk bath scene to her revenge on her would-be lover. Sniveling, whining and wearing a huge fake nose, Charles Laughton is pure effeminate evil as Nero (notice his catamite), a foul blot on the face of humanity & stealing all his scenes from everyone else. History tells us that Nero eventually murdered Poppaea by stomping her to death...

Ian Keith is enjoyable as an unpunished villain. Ferdinand Gottshalk & Vivian Tobin are effectively degraded as Roman bacchants. Film mavens will recognize the voice of John Carradine, calling `We who are about to die, salute you!&apos; out of the arena to Nero; he can later be spotted in the role of a Christian martyr ascending the dungeon stairs to his death.

DeMille had just returned to Paramount from a 3-year, 3-picture stint at MGM, where he was remarkably subdued. Back at his home studio he was allowed more license. Wrapping a little sermon up in a lot of sin, he filled this pre-Production Code drama with plenty of the latter. When THE SIGN OF THE CROSS was re-released in 1944, many cuts had to be made. The film now having been restored, it&apos;s not difficult to guess which sections those were. The Dance of the Naked Moon & much of the antics in the final arena sequence are beyond the bounds of good taste, but certainly not beyond the bounds of Cecil B. DeMille.",10,"['Drama', 'History']","['pre code film', 'gold coin', 'wine', 'silver coin', 'italy']",1933-02-10,['Cecil B.

The animation and production values are awesome. Just seeing Springfield and all the characters on the big screen is enough to make this movie worth going to. But I was rather let down in terms of the comedy. It seemed like it was dumbed down to give it more mass appeal and that&apos;s disappointing. I also had annoying little kids sitting around me and their father refused to shut them up...which somewhat ruined the experience. The first 45 min are good, then it dips in humor.

The Sin of Nora Moran,"Nora Moran, a young woman with a difficult and tragic past, is sentenced to die for a murder that she did not commit. She could easily reveal the truth and save her own life, if only it would not damage the lives, careers, and rep...","THE SIN OF NORA MORAN (Majestic, 1933) directed by Phil Goldstone, with title inspiration to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer&apos;s THE SIN OF MADELIN CLAUDET (1931) featuring Helen Hayes, is a low-budget production with high production values. Starring Zita Johann, a notable stage actress with few films to her credit. her characterization of Nora Moran offer her a very rare opportunity in a feature film performance.

The plot opens as John Grant (Alan Dinehart), a district attorney, is visited by Edith Crawford (Claire DuPrey), his sister, regarding a handful of unsigned love letters belonging to her deceased husband and governor of the state, Dick Crawford (Paul Cavanagh). Grant reveals the woman to be Nora Moran, age 21, in prison on death row awaiting her execution. Through flashback, Grant relates the sin of Nora Moran, Crawford&apos;s mistress, starting as a child of six where young Nora (Cora Sue Collins) is adopted by Mr. and Mrs. Moran (Harvey Clark and Aggie Herring). Following their deaths, the teenage Nora (Zita Johann) faces life of uncertainty. With the help of her good friend, Father Ryan (Henry B. Walthall), Nora goes on her own searching for work until eventually working for the King Brothers Circus under Paulino (John Miljan), a lion tamer. She leaves the circus after Paulino forces himself on her. While in New York, Nora becomes a chorus girl in musical shows, attracting attention of Dick Crawford (Paul Cavanagh), a man with political ambitions. She learns through Grant that Dick has a wife, but continues to show her love for Dick by preventing Paulino from ruining his political career through blackmail. Grant&apos;s story further reveals why Nora ended up in prison and awaiting execution. Also in the cast are Sarah Padden, Ann Brody, Syd Saylor and Otis Harlan.

I first saw THE SIN OF NORA MORAN when presented during the after midnight hours on New York City&apos;s WOR, Channel 9 back in 1982 under another title, VOICE FROM THE GRAVE. With Zita Johann, best known for co-starring opposite Boris Karloff in THE MUMMY (Universal, 1932), I assumed this to be another horror movie. I have never heard of VOICE FROM THE GRAVE and wanted to see what it was all about. After many years in obscurity, THE SIN OF NORA MORAN (title restored) not only turned up on DVD, but made its Turner Classic Movies premiere May 3, 2020, by this viewing refreshed my memory. Following the original theatrical title and opening credits, THE SIN OF NORA MORAN predated those film elements used frequently during the 1940s through its grand mix of film noir narrative, montage sequences, voice over thoughts, split screen changeover, non-stop underscoring, and slight dose of supernatural overtones. Coming from an independent movie studio as Majestic, THE SIN OF NORA MORAN works surprisingly well through its then unique method of storytelling told during its 64 minutes. Aside from THE POWER AND THE GLORY (Fox, 1933) starring Spencer Tracy, it makes one wonder if there are any other flashback narratives of this sort that have become virtually unknown to film scholars?

Regardless of this newfound rediscovery and interesting premise, it appears Zita Johann&apos;s legacy continues to remain more for THE MUMMY than THE SIN OF NORA MORAN.

Siren,A bachelor party becomes a savage fight for survival when the groomsmen unwittingly unleash a fabled predator upon the festivities.,"20 May 2017. Siren is one of those horror movies that might have been better, but really how could it? Too often other movies become so simplistically, stereotypical. The PBS television movie Dracula (1997) had similar polished authentic focus. Here the Siren is depicted quite well considering, without either the romanticized nor the glorified monster portrayal. Like in the Keanu Reeve&apos;s cult horror Constantine (2005) or perhaps even more like the more recent depictions of eerie characters like Anya Taylor-Joy&apos;s Morgan (2016) or Scarlett Johansson&apos;s Under the Skin (2013). In the lower budget tradition of Stanley Kubrick&apos;s last movie classic Eyes Wide Shut (1999), Siren really wasn&apos;t so much scary as it is absurdist horror with a more human inhuman twist. So really this movie while it isn&apos;t superb and a great classic, it is a solid horror movie that stands out from most other for its creepy factor, its more all American plot outline, and its more somber rather than typical gross out ending.",7,"['Horror', 'Mystery', 'Thriller']","['bachelor party', 'mythological creature', 'flying monster', 'female monster', 'strip club']",2016-12-02,['Gregg Bishop'],"['Chase Williamson', 'Hannah Fierman', 'Justin Welborn']","['Ben Collins', 'Luke Piotrowski', 'David Bruckner']"

Sleepaway Camp,"Angela Baker, a shy, traumatized young girl, is sent to summer camp with her cousin. Shortly after her arrival, anyone with sinister or less than honorable intentions toward her gets their comeuppance.","Sleepaway Camp (1983) 

*** (out of 4)

Angela (Felissa Rose) goes with her cousin Ricky (Jonathan Tiersten) to a summer camp where she&apos;s constantly picked on and harassed by the most popular girl in camp (Karen Fields). Over and over again Angela is picked on due to her shyness, which causes Ricky to have to defend her and before long dead bodies begin to pile up.

SLEEPAWAY CAMP is a pretty notorious entry in the 80&apos;s slasher genre due in large part to a terrific twist at the end, which I obviously won&apos;t spoil here. If you want to play a uptight critic it&apos;s easy to really cream this film because there are some pretty bad things throughout including some at times hideous acting. However, if you&apos;re a fan of the genre, which I am, there&apos;s no question that this film has a lot going for it and it fits nicely into the genre, which at times delivered one cliché after another. There&apos;s no doubt that SLEEPAWAY CAMP has some clichéd moments but there&apos;s still no doubting it&apos;s impact on the genre and the all around good time you can have with it.

I think the best thing about the film is that it just feels so much like the 80&apos;s. The movie has the basic set-up taking place in a camp with a psycho running around but there&apos;s a lot of other stuff thrown in including a bizarre subplot dealing with a pedophile and there&apos;s even some stranger stuff that I won&apos;t go into so that I avoid any spoilers. The film also shows how bullying was handled in the 80&apos;s, which was usually with a big fat nothing. The film manages to really make you feel the time that it was set in and I think writer- director Robert Hiltzik deserves some credit for putting some of the more bizarre things in here.

It also doesn&apos;t hurt that you&apos;ve got a group of characters that you can root for and against. One can&apos;t help but feel sympathy for Angela and you also can&apos;t help but like Ricky and Paul. The villains in the film are so over-the-top cruel that you also don&apos;t mind seeing them get knocked off one at a time. Then there&apos;s Judy who&apos;s certainly one of the most memorable villains in the history of the slasher period. Fields performance is just so spot-on that you can&apos;t help see the glee in her as she torments Angela. Rose is also quite charming in her role and there&apos;s certainly not a better slasher actor than Tiersten when it comes to saying profanity.

The murder scenes are mostly off-camera, I&apos;m sure due to budget reasons but they&apos;re still quite memorable and especially the aftermath when we see what actually happened. The make-up effects are quite simple but effective enough. I also liked how the main goal of the film wasn&apos;t the gore and violence but instead the characters and especially the mystery. I&apos;m sure some will guess what&apos;s going on but if you go through the film without knowing and just guessing who&apos;s doing the killing, it certainly adds to the entertainment level. SLEEPAWAY CAMP has a lot of nostalgia going for it but it&apos;s also one of the more entertaining films in the 80&apos;s slasher cycle.",,['Horror'],"['surprise ending', 'summer camp', 'psycho killer', 'stabbing', 'sleep away camp']",1983-11-18,['Robert Hiltzik'],"['Felissa Rose', 'Jonathan Tiersten', 'Karen Fields']",['Robert Hiltzik']
Sleepaway Camp II: Unhappy Campers,"Angela, supposedly reformed and living under an assumed surname, is working at a summer camp. However, when the campers start misbehaving, she soon reverts to her old ways.","I really don&apos;t know what you would call this movie--Horror, Comedy, Spoof, or just plain silly. I loved it needless to say. I thought the first Sleepaway Camp was a great walk up to the horror genre. This movie, following 5 years later has our sweet little Angela all grown up with real breasts and other really girlie things! And he, excuse me, she is a counselor at Camp Rolling Hills. 

Well, in the opening scene Angela is up to her old tricks--Starting the body count off right. Throughout, she decapitates, torches, hangs, strangles, stabs, many many other campers. She even drowns one in an outhouse filled with leeches. At times this movie almost feels like it really wanted to develop a serious plot, just as the first did. Then something silly is done or said that lets us, the audience know this movie isn&apos;t gonna take itself too seriously. I feel that is a major down fall for most B-horror movies. This one mixes, horror, humor and blood and guts in a very balanced way. 

 My only problem...I feel that the character of Angela was much more devious and cunning in the first than in this or the 3rd one. I think that is only because they didn&apos;t wanna make these movies too seriously. I like that they didn&apos;t...Very enjoyable sequel with an Okay cast of no ones excpet Angela and Molly. They both have very famouse brothers. 

Filmed back to back with the 3rd one...Look for Sleepaway Camp 4 coming out next year....

Sleeper,A nerdish store owner is revived out of cryostasis into a future world to fight an oppressive government.,"We are blessed that Woody was around, making movies as interesting as this when he was.

Already with this one, he began his vast exploration of movie techniques and devices that would last 25 years or so.

The idea is simple in this one: he wanted to use film slapstick from a bygone era. How better to situate that than to move the whole picture into a future era?

We have some truly classic stuff here. The banana joke, The mirror joke. The robot pantomime. The acting out of the Jewish dinner (done in later movies too). The inflated man joke. You can find all these in any number of Keaton. Marx, Laurel & Hardy movies.

The unifying string of time travel, a romance, the leader and his nose is too weak to make this a solidly recommended outing. And it wouldn&apos;t be for a couple years until Woody cared about the cinematography at all.

After all, he mastered the teenage drive-in trade with epics such as Little Shop of Horrors (1959) and Attack of the Crab Monsters (1957) back when I was a teen- maybe not Oscar fare, but still lot&apos;s of fun.

I wish I could say the same about this bloody mess. Except for the promising beginning, there&apos;s no real story, just a succession of dark menacing and anti-climaxes that&apos;re overdone and soon lose impact.

Then too, it may be a cast of unknowns, but the girls do well even if short on acting experience. Can&apos;t say the same about the madman who&apos;s about as scary as an unshaven milkman. Anyway how about that power-drill that&apos;s not exactly a surgical instrument. My take on the madman&apos;s problem is that his own power-drill doesn&apos;t work, so he uses a symbolic mechanical one to get even with his female frustrations. However that may be, the over-done flick&apos;s not good enough to be either a parody or an effective fright fest.",,['Horror'],"['female rear nudity', 'exploitation', 'teensploitation', 'slasher', 'grindhouse film']",1982-11-12,['Amy Holden Jones'],"['Michelle Michaels', 'Robin Stille', 'Michael Villella']","['Rita Mae Brown', 'Amy Holden Jones']"

Snapshot,"They say a picture is worth a thousand words. Former paparazzi Thomas Grady&apos;s most recent photo, a scandalous shot of the First Lady, is certainly worth more, a lot more.","Snapshot is a low budget film that has a few surprises. Despite being low budgeted, it does feature a few surprising supporting actors-- such as Ralph Loggia and Joyce DeWitt. It also has a plot that seems silly and inconsequential, but if you stick with the film to the end, it WILL make sense and offer an amazing twist. So, on balance, it&apos;s worth seeing despite its flaws.

The story is about a down and out photographer, Thomas (Zach McGowan). He has some issues with his father (Loggia) and is also struggling to get his life together and is living in someone&apos;s basement! He also has a bratty daughter from a previous relationship...and she&apos;s a bit of a mess. All in all, his life prospects look awful and by all accounts he&apos;s a bit of a loser. However, his big break comes when he happens to be in the right place at the right time...and he just happens to have his camera along with him. What sort of photo does he get? Well, let&apos;s just say that the First Lady forgot to wear underwear that day...and the photo could be VERY embarrassing if it gets published. Soon, huge offers start pouring in and Thomas is torn. After all, it sure would help him out of his financial mess...but it also would be a real jerky move! While the notion of folks threatening Thomas over the photo didn&apos;t make much sense when it was introduced, just sit tight...it does make sense at the very end. That is fortunate because I sure was confused and thought it was just a case of bad writing...which it wasn&apos;t.

Despite some nice acting and a story that kept my interest, the film is clearly far from perfect. There are a few dangling plot elements that seem to have been forgotten (such as the trashy daughter&apos;s even trashier boyfriend) and some of the acting and writing are a bit suspect (the over-the-top gay guy was about as subtle as a stripper showing up at a Baptist barbecue). But I can look past these shortcomings. After all, these are folks who are relatively new to their craft in many cases and I look at the film as a training ground. And, there&apos;s enough promise to make me want to see more of their work in the future.",5,['Drama'],"['paparazzi', 'snapshot', 'photograph', 'photographer', 'celebrity']",2014-06-01,['Eric Etebari'],"['Angela Little', 'Zach McGowan', 'Angela Gots']",['Robert Borneman']

Snuff,,"OK first of all, if you watch this movie because you are expecting a real snuff film (or at least a realistic looking fake), you will be greatly disappointed. 

First of all, there&apos;s no record of an actual snuff film being made. The fact that there is a DVD of this film available should tell you right away there&apos;s no way that it could be real snuff. If snuff exists, it is an extremely well kept secret. 

Second, the snuff scene is so fake that I can&apos;t believe that anyone actually believed that it was real. You can see exactly how the gore was faked, not to mention the fact that the actress is not very good.

If you watch this film, watch it for the movie preceeding the snuff scene. It is extremely poorly written, directed and acted, but it is so bad that it will make you laugh. My friend and I think that this movie should be called SATAN&apos;S B*TCHES, because it&apos;s kinda like CHARLIE&apos;S ANGELS, but the women are evil and their master is Satan (pronounced Suh-TAWN).

I had to take my time with this one, as it seemed to go on and on and on, but when I checked, only one hour had passed. So yes, I do agree with other reviewers that said it is a slow movie, but somehow, it simply fails in keeping your interest up.

The good: the concept of the 5 loosely related, lurid stories is clever, as is them taking place all in the same desolate area. If you like creepy, graphic horror, that&apos;s also present. Also, very imaginative monsters in some of the stories.

The bad: It&apos;s not fleshed out enough. I don&apos;t need exposition, but these stories are so unexplained it&apos;s almost like they ran out of money when filming the picture. And it&apos;s so low-budget that it was hard for me to get invested in the characters. The entire concept of what this town might intrigued me, but nothing is explained and I came away wanting more.

Basically, and bizarrely, this story, about unhappy and lonely people, is staged in a 70s style space station. The acting is fantastic (absolutely everyone is good) and the sound track is delicious, but there is absolutely no comedy, apart from strangeness linked to the setting and a few gimmicks, (all done in the first 5 minutes).

Geomi sup,A recently widowed TV producer is drawn to an isolated cabin in a mysterious woods.,"I saw Spider Forest at the Toronto International Film Festival last night. To be honest, I wasn&apos;t quite sure of what to expect from it - was it a horror film? Or was it a detective story, a thriller, or something altogether different? The answer, I think, is that it is all of those things.

The film begins with a series of mysterious and shocking events in a cabin in the forest, and much like a spider&apos;s web, returns to this place quite often in an attempt to unravel its secrets.

Spider Forest manages to avoid most of the modern horror/suspense/thriller conventions, including scary pale children and does not rely on special effects to set the mood. Instead, the psychological predicament of the main character creates an atmosphere of blurred confusion and distrust of one&apos;s own memory.

The story is entirely unique and never quite goes in the direction the audience is expecting.

I give a confident recommendation to see this film.",8,"['Drama', 'Horror', 'Mystery']","['psychotronic film', 'cabin in the woods', 'television producer', 'cabin', 'mistaken identity']",2004-09-03,['Song Il-gon'],"['Woo-seong Kam', 'Jung Suh', 'Kyung-hun Kang']","['Yoo-Sung Hong', 'Song Il-gon', 'Dong-wook Kim']"
Spider-Man 2,Peter Parker is beset with troubles in his failing personal life as he battles a brilliant scientist named Doctor Otto Octavius.,"Spider-Man was almost the perfect comic book movie and perhaps released at the best time. When audiences get bored with what genres normally cook up (mostly horror) we the viewers always look for the next best thing. For a while, horror movies were all the fad, but these movies can become boring extremely fast and Hollywood must find something completely opposite from horror to try and keep our attention. So, what might be completely opposite from horror? Well first, lets make a list of what is opposite from horror. Happy is one, action is another; good guys always winning might be another. So, what might be a good opposite for horror is a comic book movie. Now, a lot of money comes from what Hollywood had to offer for comic book movies. Some are failures (Electra) and others are hits. For the most part, most of them are hits. Spider-Man 2 is one of them. We begin with Peter Parker continuing his job as Spider-Man, but all is not well. Peter&apos;s friend, Harry Osborn, hates Spider-Man and wants him dead. Because of Peter&apos;s relation with taking photographs of Spider-Man, Harry has problems with Peter that only continue to grow worse as the movie goes on. The main villain of this movie is Dr. Otto Octavius who later becomes Dr. Ock. In a freak accident, he is connected to his invention of arms that are suppose to help him with an even bigger invention. His wife is killed in the process and the arms attached to him seem to have complete control of what he does. Deeply grieved, Dr. Ock runs away and hides, but not for long. He comes to terms with what he has become and starts his life as super villain. As usual, it is up to Spider-Man to save the day, but something is not right. Spider-Man seems to be losing his powers and has no control of what is happening to him. It is true that this film is better than the first entry, but only by a little bit. It seems though, that scene were Peter saves the people a train was little over it when everyone on the train discovers he is Spider-Man. Overall: A-

Also good are Roland Culver as Commander Bride, Toni Edgar-Bruce as Lady Houston, Anne Firth as Harper, Derrick De Marney as Jefferson, and Howard&apos;s daughter, Leslie Ruth Howard, in her only film appearance as Nurse Kennedy.

Spooks Run Wild,,"Although this East Side Kids feature has its pluses and some good sequences, it probably could have been better. Having Leo Gorcey, Huntz Hall, Bobby Jordan, and the rest of the gang being paired with Bela Lugosi is an intriguing thought, and it certainly seems as if it could have been the basis for a really entertaining movie. Perhaps the biggest letdown is simply that Lugosi never gets a lot to do, so that he does not really get the chance to become a part of things.

The setup is kind of convoluted, and it takes a fair amount of time to get to the main action, which has the gang roaming around in an old abandoned mansion where Lugosi&apos;s character has just taken up residence. Long stretches of the movie are carried simply by the interplay among Muggs and the rest of the group as they explore, stumble around, and get lost in various situations, all the while wisecracking, ad-libbing, and playing with the props.

As always, most of these antics are quite entertaining, but here the actual story is too negligible to sustain its end of things. A more carefully written story, and most importantly a better, less thankless role for Lugosi, could have made much better use of this unusual combination of talent.",,"['Horror', 'Comedy']","['dead end kids', 'east side kids', 'psychotronic film', 'old dark house', 'horror novel']",1941-10-24,['Phil Rosen'],"['Bela Lugosi', 'Leo Gorcey', 'Bobby Jordan']","['Carl Foreman', 'Charles R.

The terrible game of rugby league football is beautifully shot in all the horror of its violent thuggery and macho heroism. The streets, the houses, the shops, the pubs, the clubs and the children playing all evoke memories of that admittedly dreary but familiar visions. The living spaces, some cramped and dinged, like mine a that time, and others spacious and exuding that illusive smell of success (or upper class thuggery!)

Spotlight,"The true story of how the Boston Globe uncovered the massive scandal of child molestation and cover-up within the local Catholic Archdiocese, shaking the entire Catholic Church to its core.","Relevant, powerful and astonishing. Shocking, criminal and true. These are the only words to describe this film as it has literally put the &apos;spotlight&apos; on the systematic cover-up by the Catholic Church of mass molestation and sexual assault acts performed by the priests in the Boston archdiocese that were trusted in the communities they represented. These &apos;men of God&apos; preyed on the weak and vulnerable for years and the most powerful religious sect in the world did nothing but sweep it under the proverbial carpet. &apos;Spotlight&apos;s&apos; dramatic importance has immediately drawn the attention of film lovers who crave a riveting production that dives deep into a very real circumstance that has impacted every corner of the globe.

Tom McCarthy could not have been at the helm of a better film and what he has been able to achieve in terms of wrestling the attentions of the audience is worthy of the highest praise. McCarthy, along with Josh Singer have written a gritty story that pulls no punches and it isn&apos;t afraid to get right into the heart of the required subject. For &apos;Spotlight&apos; to have been received by the critics as well as it has it had to stride unapologetically into this unbelievable and sordid affair. It needed to expose the sensitive and controversial information that some people may find confronting but in the context of this outstanding production, absolutely essential. It destroyed lives and revealed the blatant arrogance of this pious organisation.

The all star cast jumps right out at you even before the opening scenes are shot up onto the screen. Based on true events, &apos;Spotlight&apos; pushes all the right buttons from the beginning. As the name implies, &apos;Spotlight&apos; refers to the investigative journalism team who report for the Boston Globe newspaper. They are thorough, relentless and will stop at nothing to expose headline stories that affect the everyday lives of normal American&apos;s. When the new editor, Marty Baron (Liev Schreiber), drops a potentially explosive story in the lap of Spotlight chief, Walter Robinson (Michael Keaton), about allegations of sexual abuse involving the Catholic Church, Robinson and his loyal crew go about uncovering one of the greatest criminal cover-ups in human history. The deeper their investigation goes the more sadistic and shocking the outcome becomes. Fingers are pointed, people are accused and the list of clergy involved becomes larger and larger. The whole situation ceases to become a Boston problem and grows to a worldwide exposure. Rachel McAdams and Mark Ruffalo are part of the investigative team as young committed journalists Sacha Pfeiffer and Mike Rezendes respectively. McAdams performance is award worthy and Ruffalo is fully engaged in a role that matches his talents. Michael Keaton has found his niche in Hollywood as a sort after mentor showcasing another strong performance as the tenacious and hard hitting Robinson. The real &apos;cherry&apos; in the cast is the presence of the magnificent Stanley Tucci as Mitchell Garabedian who represents the victims in the whole saga. Tucci adds the class that takes &apos;Spotlight&apos; to another level with an engrossingly accomplished performance.

This is the best journalistic drama since 1976&apos;s &apos;All the President&apos;s Men&apos;. Tom McCarthy has centred his narrative within the confines of the Boston Globe&apos;s newsroom as it should have been. &apos;Spotlight&apos; doesn&apos;t shy away from the true nature of newspaper drama and the audience benefits from such an authentic setting. Top shelf acting from some of the very best young talent sparks the fire that captivates the viewer. Throw in some true icons in Keaton and Tucci and &apos;Spotlight&apos; has the perfect balance. This film will be classified as the very best in its category and has set a benchmark in terms of confronting realism.

The Spy Who Loved Me,"James Bond investigates the hijacking of British and Russian submarines carrying nuclear warheads, with the help of a K.G.B. agent whose lover he killed.","This time James Bond-Roger Moore third outing and best entry ,he join forces with female Russian agent named Anya Amasova(Bach)to eliminate a nasty villainous(Curt Jurgens)and his henchman, a giant steel-toothed named Jaws(Richard Kiel).He schemes to utilize captured US and Russians atomic underwater with objective to destroy the world.For the first time nuclear submarines from Russia,Britain are sailing side by side.It may look like the beginning of WWIII,but don&apos;t worry .As usual,intervene Q (Desmond LLewelyn),MonneyPenny(Lois Maxwell),M(Bernard Lee) and Russian general Gogol(Walter Gotell).Roger Moore plays perfectly the master spy,Moore tells about his Simon Templar,The Saint, that he was a private person doing things for other people to help them and was rather a boy-scout following the rules of television and James Bond is an assassin licensed to kill.He&apos;s right,the tone is perfect for the times and for Roger Moore&apos;s brand of James Bond.Times have changed and for example, the Ian Fleming book based the film ,has nothing to do with cinematographic adaptation.His beautiful co-star is Barbara Bach and of course no Bond movie would be complete without the gorgeous Bond girls(Caroline Munro,Valerie Leon,among others).The movie is an agreeable blending of frenetic action,spectacular and exciting sets and humor with tongue in cheek.The film contains the world&apos;s largest sound stage specially constructed by production designer Ken Adam.In the inauguration day was even as special guest,former Prime Minister,Sir Harold Wilson. The motion picture is shot in Sardinia, Cala Volpe.There appears the car Lotus Esprit,¨Sweet Nellie¨, with weapons and rapidly become in sub.There&apos;s a very funny scene when the Lotus comes out of the water,but in order to avoid seeing the car underwater,Kem Adam had a speedboat doing waves .The scenes were really very simple attached a cable under the van to the front of the Lotus and pulled the car out the water.The Lotus could function underwater,but had to wear breathtaking equipment inside.The producer Albert Broccoli tells that they went to Egypt in the mid-1970s,tensions were hight in the Mideast.It took some careful negotiation to get out crew into Egypt.They had to submit the script in advance and an Egyptian government official had to be present during the shooting to make Egypt certain and did not portray the country in a negative light.The most challenging sequence was the night shooting in pyramids Giza,where was re-staged the ¨Son et Lumiere¨,despite the dramatic lighting effects much of the show had to be recreated in studio(Pinewood) using special effects.While the Bond films are not travelogues ,the producers do like to take viewers to spectacular places and show them things in a way that they&apos;ve never seen before.The producers gambled that audiences were ready for a more fantasy-laden Bond film.Egypt(with an impressive temple of Karnak) was a great location for cameraman Claude Renoir,made it look elegant and exotic,Claude was the nephew of the great director,Jean Renoir.He helped photograph many Renoir&apos;s great films,like the ¨Grand illusion¨.He also shot second unit on ¨Cleopatra¨and photographer the 60s cult classic,¨Barbarella¨.This is his last major film as cinematographer.The film is well directed by Lewis Gilbert who had previously directed¨You only live twice¨a decade earlier.This picture is one of the more memorable Bond-Moore.",7,"['Action', 'Adventure', 'Thriller']","['007', 'spy film', 'secret service agent', 'official james bond series', '1970s']",1977-08-03,['Lewis Gilbert'],"['Roger Moore', 'Barbara Bach', 'Curd Jürgens']","['Christopher Wood', 'Richard Maibaum', 'Ian Fleming']"

But these women are not go...","In the UK, if you remember the early 80&apos;s there&apos;s a very good chance that you&apos;ll have heard of the exploitation movie SS Experiment Camp (1976). This was after all an infamous flick that was majorly responsible for helping kick off the whole video nasty furore in Britain back at that time. The promotional poster used for it was the one from its video box and it depicted a naked woman hung upside down with a swastika hanging from her, while an ominous face of an SS officer looks sinisterly on. This, along with a title that promised all kinds of atrocities played out in the hugely taboo arena of the Holocaust, meant that it quickly became an enemy of the state and condemned by all manner of people who most probably hadn&apos;t seen it. I reckon most couldn&apos;t have because in reality SS Experiment Camp turned out to be an enormously silly film with some genuinely hilarious moments (I realise that is hard to believe but trust me on this one please). Whatever the case, along with fellow nasty Driller Killer (1979) its legend far outstripped its content, which was admittedly in poor taste but hardly shocking stuff. Anyway, getting back on track, its director Sergio Garrone made another nazisploitation film back-to-back with it called SS Camp 5: Women&apos;s Hell. This one never made the notorious video nasty list but only due to the trifling matter that it was never actually released on home video in the UK at that time because if it had I would be willing to bet my mortgage that it would have found itself on that list in super quick time. Despite having a less prominent reputation, there is no question that this is the nastier film of the two.

The Italian nazisploitation sub-genre is one that I have some interest in given that it still seems incredible that there was an actual cycle of these kinds of movies. Even today they are pretty notorious and are not necessarily the kind of thing you would tell everyone you had spent time watching. But the way I see it is that in the 40&apos;s if Adolf Hitler and Heinrich Himmler had envisioned that thirty-five years in the future a bunch of low budget Italian film-makers were to depict their beloved Nazi regime as compromising of badly dubbed sexually deviant sociopaths in a bunch of z-grade exploitation movies, I daresay Adolf and Heinrich would have been mortally offended. So for this reason, I say hooray for nazisploitation. In fairness, it&apos;s a genre which is decidedly ropey and with some entries that are particularly unpleasant. But they are a historical oddity now and so seem safer to prod and check out with the benefit of hindsight.

Like the genre in general, SS Camp 5: Women&apos;s Hell operates under the women-in-prison bracket of film. In this one, the women are immediately divided into two groups by the Germans. Those that will work as forced prostitutes and those who will be used for human experiments. To this end, both the soft-core and horror bases are covered right away. Of the latter there isn&apos;t necessarily a lot but what there is is pretty sleazy and violent – a group of escapees are burned in one of the camp ovens (very unconvincingly to be fair), while a grim torture scene follows on from this where we witness all manner of delights such as a tongue being ripped out, fingers being burned, a stomach being shredded by a metal knuckle-duster and a head being crushed in a vice. The camp experiments themselves restrict themselves to legs being set on fire. None of this stuff is particularly convincing but it&apos;s the thought that counts and its pretty mean-spirited throughout. The soft-core stuff compromises of lashings of nudity and some rape scenes – if you&apos;re looking for erotica it sure isn&apos;t to be found here! Despite all this depravity, the most offensive thing about the film is the decision to include genuine death camp footage in amongst all this sleazy movie exploitation. Now, that is bad taste in the truest sense of the word and definitely not in a good way. On the whole, I enjoyed this one though. It&apos;s basically another slice of successfully unpleasant Italian Nazi exploitation.

The St. Francisville Experiment,Four young people spend a night in a haunted mansion.,"I know a lot of people seem to have a passionate hatred for this film. After all, it was made to cash in on the success of The Blair Witch Project. But to be fair, the film industry does this all the time, taking a popular film and its ideas & themes, then running them completely into the ground.

 But who really cares about that crap, as long as the film is good. I do not claim to possess an intricate knowledge of filmmaking; I simply like what I like and don&apos;t care if other people laugh at me and think I&apos;m stupid for enjoying what they consider bad cinema.

When I first watched The St. Francisville Experiment in college with a couple of my friends, I was totally drawn into the film. For the hour+ that it was on I was completely engrossed in the goings on of the four characters as they try to determine whether or not the house is haunted. Granted, the acting certainly wasn&apos;t Oscar-caliber, but the cast was believable enough to keep my attention for the duration of the film. They exuded enough of a naive charm that I found them likeable and wanted them to come out of the house unscathed.

Perhaps most important of all involving a haunted house film was that I found the film scary. It&apos;s been quite a while since I&apos;ve felt fear from watching a film, having my skin break out in goosebumps. And this movie did it for me, and I can&apos;t thank them enough.

Ripoff or not, I like this film! It has believable characters, a cool back story based on true events, eerie atmosphere, and an overall feeling of doom and horror. I like this film even more than The Blair Witch Project (which is itself somewhat of a ripoff of Cannibal Holocaust), and I am not ashamed to say that.",,"['Horror', 'Mystery', 'Thriller']","['handheld camera', 'fake documentary', 'overnight in a haunted house', 'paranormal phenomenon', 'psychotronic film']",2001-10-03,['Ted Nicolaou'],"['Madison Charap', 'Troy Taylor', 'Ryan Larson']",[]

Stake Land,"In a world of vampires, an expert vampire hunter and his young protégé travel toward sanctuary.","Ever since the success of 28 Days Later back in 2002, the post- apocalyptic genre of films has been a crowded market with its fair share of successes and failures. Notable releases such as The Road and Zombieland have been accompanied by such misfires as Doomsday and I Am Legend that, whilst entertaining, ultimately failed to hit their mark. Stakeland is a brave and accomplished entry in Jim Mickle&apos;s career, and although there are only a handful of original ideas throughout the film, the ideas taken from other movies are handled with enough skill that they serve only to enhance the overall viewing experience. It must be said, some of the director&apos;s own ideas are fantastic and show a great potential for the future - a future that the ragged band of survivors we follow throughout Stakeland may not be able to enjoy.

After our protagonist is saved from a disastrous situation which leaves him as the sole survivor of his family, he is taken under the wing of his rescuer; the elusive &apos;Mister&apos;, whose similarities to Whistler from Blade appear to be more than pure coincidence. Together,they embark on a road trip that tests them to their very limits as they encounter a whole host of dangers and struggle to survive whilst roaming throughout North America, picking up a number of travelling companions on the way.

In a storyline not too dissimilar to The Mist, some surviving factions of humans believe that God has sent the vampires to punish humanity and it is these that pose almost as much danger to our band of travellers as the dangerous breeds of vampire that stalk them. These cults are a welcome addition to the film, enhancing the aspect of danger and providing the basis for some of the film&apos;s more memorable moments in a standout scene where a supposedly safe town is assaulted from the air.

The initially nameless main character - played brilliantly by Connor Paolo (the spitting image of a young Colin Farrel) - has his life turned upside down at the start of the movie, however, we do not get to see how the whole world initially turned upside down, and the cause of the vampire&apos;s origins is rarely touched upon. His story is told through countless monologues that overlay the fantastic imagery of sparse vistas and urban decay, creating a sense of scale that is far beyond what we see on the screen. Whilst the other characters we meet do not have enough time to develop fully, they all play an essential part in the story, and although some scenes could have been far more powerful if the audience were affected by their plight, the suspense was enough to keep me on my edge of the seat throughout.

There are few scares to be found in Stakeland but the overall sense of foreboding doom and the generous helpings of violence and gore should please the majority of horror fans. Anyone with even a passing interest in post-apocalyptic films will definitely take a lot from Stakeland and although it is not quite a genre classic, it will certainly become a cult favourite in a few years time.

Stand by Me,"After the death of one of his friends, a writer recounts a childhood journey with his friends to find the body of a missing boy.","If you grew up in the world before WiFi, a higher fidelity world depending on your circumstances as a child, there&apos;s a good chance that a lot of your growing up was done outside, with a group of pals, mates, friends or chums - who all sought to share what they knew, and discover together what they did not.

There&apos;s no coming of age so to speak, as we continually discover as we get older, but whatever it is that we do become, we generally do it without the bonds and support that were so crucial during our formative days and quite often end up aimlessly drifting, nostalgic for the past and the shared experience of growing up, with those we would have entrusted our lives, our souls, our hearts and our minds to - albeit with the occasional minor squabble thrown in for good measure.

Starry Eyes,A hopeful young starlet uncovers the ominous origins of the Hollywood elite and enters into a deadly agreement in exchange for fame and fortune.,"Four stars positive for a fairly innovative score and Argento-esque visuals, plus some pretty solid acting by the lead and one or two supporting actors. Beyond that, I have to admit, I watched the entire thing (resisting the urge to turn it off many times) because I wanted, hoped for, the ending to bring everything together in some redeeming way. Instead, I was disappointed. The movie was difficult to watch all around but not because of horror elements - it&apos;s hard, for one thing, to feel invested in a story when you can&apos;t empathize with its protagonist - admittedly there are exceptions to that but this isn&apos;t one of them. I also felt like some of the plot devices relied on clichéd, negative stereotyping (can&apos;t say more without spoilers) and that the end just didn&apos;t make sense in any narrative or metaphor driven way.

Would critics have given this film a bigger pass if Will Ferrell and John C Reiley&apos;s film were called Talladega Nights II?

The big stars of the film are not John C Reilly and Will Ferrell but Mary Steenburgen and Richard Jenkins for holding down straight faces and being convincing as a loving dad and a loving mom of such silly characters.

Stevie,,"I had a tough time watching the scene where the camera is on Steve James as Tonya tells him that at least something good came of all this, that at least a film was made about Stevie. I didn&apos;t like how long they allowed the camera to catch Steve&apos;s emotional reaction and it seemed a little too obvious...like the scene in Broadcast News where William Hurt whips up some tears to show on camera. I don&apos;t like that kind of manipulation. However, that being said, I don&apos;t mean to imply that Steven James wasn&apos;t sincere in his reaction; it was his editing choice that seems insincere.

It&apos;s a complicated film. Just like Stevie the person, there are no easy answers; unlike Stevie the person, life is not simply black and white. I do think the title reflects many things: the subject as he is now, the director&apos;s memory of Stevie the little boy, and the director himself. I don&apos;t believe that Stevie was exploited, but there is something in the intention of the film that is unsettling. And I think that unsettling feeling is an okay thing to have. If I taught a film class, this is a film I would definitely want to use to explore the nature of point of view, the ethics of documentary film-making, and the nature of simply being human.

I adored Tonya&apos;s friend in Chicago. Tonya, her friend, and Wanda reflect the very best about people and shatter easy stereotypes.

The Sting,Two grifters team up to pull off the ultimate con.,"The Sting, evoking a bygone era of gangsters and con men, was the deserved Best Picture of 1973. The Sting won that Oscar plus a whole flock of technical awards. One award it didn&apos;t win was for Robert Redford as Best Actor.

That must have been tough for the Academy voters because to single out Redford as opposed to Paul Newman must have felt a bit unjust. For though Newman was nominated many times over his career and finally did win for The Color of Money, did not get a nomination for The Sting.

Robert Redford is a small time grifter who while working a bait and switch street con takes off a numbers runner carrying the weekly take. The orders come down from the head man himself, Irish-American gangster Robert Shaw to kill those who did this as an example.

Redford&apos;s mentor, Robert Earl Jones, is in fact killed, mainly because Redford starts spending a lot of that newly acquired loot that tips them off. Redford wants revenge so he looks up big time con man Paul Newman who himself is dodging law enforcement as is Redford also.

They work the big con on Shaw and it&apos;s a beauty. The scheme they have is something to behold. They also have to do a couple of improvisations on the fly that lend a few twists to the scheme.

The costumes and sets really do evoke Chicago of the Thirties and director George Roy Hill assembles a great cast to support Newman and Redford. My favorite in the whole group is Charles Durning, who plays the brutally corrupt, but essentially dumb cop from Joliet who nearly gums up the works and has to be dealt with.

Special mention should also go to Robert Shaw. He&apos;s got a difficult part, maybe the most difficult in the film. He&apos;s not stupid, he would not have gotten to the top of the rackets if he was. But he also has to show that hint of human weakness that Newman, Redford, and the whole mob they assemble that makes him vulnerable to the con.

During the sixties and seventies Robert Shaw was really coming into his own as a player, getting more and more acclaim for his work. His early death was a real tragedy, there was so much more he could have been doing.

Can&apos;t also forget another co-star in this film, the ragtime music of Scott Joplin that was used to score The Sting. It probably is what most people remember about The Sting. Music from the Theodore Roosevelt era, scoring a film set in the Franklin Roosevelt era made while Nixon was president. Strange, but it actually works.

The Sting still works wonders today.",10,"['Comedy', 'Crime', 'Drama']","['con man', 'illegal activity', 'playing golf', 'con artist', 'chase']",1973-12-25,['George Roy Hill'],"['Paul Newman', 'Robert Redford', 'Robert Shaw']",['David S. Ward']
Stir of Echoes,"After being hypnotized by his sister-in-law, a man begins seeing haunting visions of a girl&apos;s ghost and a mystery begins to unfold around him.","Stir of Echoes is a very good horror thriller in the traditional sense. It&apos;s the story of a guy who gets hypnotised and develops precognitive psychic abilities which he can&apos;t control.

Kevin Bacon is excellent and shows he can be a leading man, while the rest of the cast performs well. Sets, special effects and cinematography are all very good - nothing flashy but solid. 

It has shocks and suspense, especially in the first half, and although it could be accused of being a little clichéd, it never strays too far into the &apos;seen it all before&apos; category. 

The second half of the film turns into a more traditional thriller but still holds up well, unlike similarly themed movies such as &apos;What Lies Beneath.&apos; This is because it is pleasingly short, lasting around 90 minutes (the correct length for a film of this type). There are some plot strands that aren&apos;t explained, but this can be forgiven because of the film&apos;s running time.

Although not mind blowing, it has a decent payoff at the end and left me satisfied that I&apos;d just watched a good movie. Not a great one, but a good one.

A young rascal is escaping the mob after accidentally killing a man and finds himself at the door of a sinister castle. The door opens and closes after him. But very soon it seems that he has been expected at the castle and for no other reason than to marry the lady of the house. So was his getting there a coincident in the first place? 

It&apos;s always nice to see two over-the-top actors fighting like professional beauties for the best of the picture. In this case, Laughton gallops away with his colours flying (in black and white). He really acts for every dollar. Perhaps Karloff would have been a better choice for this part, but Laughton&apos;s tour de force is such an enjoyment that I personally wouldn&apos;t have it any other way. Karloff&apos;s part isn&apos;t so interesting a material to start with, so he is pretty much wasted as far as his fans are concerned.

Unfortunately the romantic leads don&apos;t fare well. The heroes&apos; part cries out for Erroll Flynn or Stuart Granger or anyone as confident, suave, butch and agile. Unfortunately Richard Stapley-Wyler has none of these qualities. Albeit undeniably handsome, his performance is timid and effeminate. It&apos;s difficult to believe that in real life Wyler used to be a road racer. He walks like a ballerina in the mud and speaks in a flat, nasal voice which he obviously tries to make sound as low as possible. His total reluctance to act is sympathetically shared by another pretty but lifeless figurine, Sally Forrest. Personally I just think she keeps herself down as the leading man doesn&apos;t light her fire. If only these two would have blended into the acting ensemble, this film would be so much more fun.

Nevertheless, nicely shot with good settings and soundtrack, it&apos;s a treat to everyone who enjoys Corman&apos;s Poe adaptations or Hammer&apos;s dark old house films.

Streetwalkin&apos;,A high school dropout working as a street prostitute spends one night turning tricks and avoiding her emotionally unstable pimp who&apos;s starting to turn very violent.,"I have to agree with the other reviewers on here that I would probably like this more if I had not seen Vice Squad before this. Streetwalking is very similar to Vice Squad, but is not as gripping or as well done. The guy who plays the pimp Duke in this film is soft compared to Ram Rod. I must admit though that Wings Hauser&apos;s performance as Ram Rod is hard to beat. Even so, this film is definitely not bad at all and is pretty good for what it is. This Roger Corman production is pretty realistic and gritty and is a pretty downbeat depiction of the life of a prostitute. I thought the leading lady Melissa Leo was stunning and sympathetic as the ill fated cookie and her performance was pretty good. Actually the actiing was fairly good across the board. Anthony Fargas had a small, but very memorable role as a pimp. In my opinion, he should have had a bigger part, but made the best of the limited screen time he had here.

The Stunt Man,"A fugitive stumbles onto a movie set just when they need a new stunt man, takes the job as a way to hide out and falls for the leading lady while facing off with his manipulative director.","Peter O&apos;Toole gives a marvellous performance as a film director in this film which looks (to an extent) behind the scenes of movie making. I originally saw this one Sunday afternoon at the cinema and I remember how enthralled I was. There were a few surprises when something turned out to be something else like a model maybe. But it wasn&apos;t until I got the DVD that I realised there were many layers to the film.

The director had great difficulty with the studios in various stages of making the movie and although it was originally intended as an anti-Vietnam film, that had to be changed as production got further away from the war years. So although it may have lost something along the way it gained other things in the process. To my mind this makes it a stronger and more intriguing film.

If you watch the documentary that accompanies the DVD a lot is explained which you don&apos;t actually realise whilst watching the movie. Watch the film again and you will probably have a renewed interest. You will probably see it a little differently. It&apos;s not an Academy Award winner (and I don&apos;t think it should have been).

Suburban Mayhem,"The neighbors are scared of her. The police can&apos;t keep up with her.

The music and energy are all there, but there seems to be a few flat spots. It may have benefited from some further editing to keep the momentum up, even though it&apos;s already just under 90 minutes in length. It seems like the writer and director had some good ideas, that weren&apos;t fully realised.

I think many cinema-goers will find this entertaining, and I certainly recommend it over the bulk of Hollywood releases (not that that&apos;s saying much), if that&apos;s your taste. For me it seemed laboured and contrived. The performances by the actors were generally (but not universally) OK. Emily Barclay&apos;s performance was good, but her character failed to engage  somewhat like Kath and Kim on speed. It&apos;s not that her character was nasty (David Wenham&apos;s monumental performance in The Boys was extremely nasty), but more that it seemed manufactured. Her brattishness becomes grating after a while.

The mid-film interviews reminded me of 2:37. They were better done in this film, but still detract somewhat from the continuity of the film.

The script seemed a bit clunky and self-conscious and just didn&apos;t quite work for me. I think the director depended too much on the sound-track and style over substance.

Subway,"On improvising a burglary at a shady tycoon&apos;s home, Fred takes refuge in the hip and surreal universe of the Paris Metro and encounters its assorted denizens, the tycoon&apos;s henchmen and his disenchanted young wife.","This is a pure exercise in style from the Luc Besson school of film making. A handsome gangster joins ranks with a school of dropouts who populate the Parisian subway system, hounded (but never phazed) by transportation police. The trouble is that head honcho Fred has fallen in love with the pretty but stroppy wife of one of his BCBG victims, and strife ensues below the streets of gay Paree.

Christopher Lambert is amazing as the stylish rebel gangster with a heart, Fred; Isabelle Adjani is pretty but, as always, deeply annoying -- she just exudes arrogance from the bottom of her dainty little heart. On the sidelines we see an impossibly young Jean-Hugues Anglade, Jean Reno and Jean-Pierre Bacri. I actually didn&apos;t recognise Reno, that&apos;s how young and unknown he is here.

If you have a deeper interest in cinema, this is a straight ten. It&apos;s amazing how Besson brings together great style, action, fun, pace, acting, dialogue and amazing characters. Unlike most directors who film in the province and try to make it look like Paris, Besson films in Paris but makes it look like Metropolis.

Unfortunately, there isn&apos;t much of a plot and zilch suspense. The film starts with a heated heart-to-heart between Fred and pretty Héléna, and since we are aware that their affair can&apos;t end but unhappily (albeit in an incredibly chic way), the suspense is exactly zero.

Without his presence in the film, Suddenly with its length of 75 minutes on my VHS version would be a B film, even with Sterling Hayden starring in it as the sheriff. My guess is that Sinatra wanted to expand and test himself as an actor, something he did less and less of in the following decade.

The President of the United States is coming to the small town of Suddenly where he will leave the train he&apos;s traveling on and proceed by motorcade to a vacation in the Sierras. The Secret Service has come to town to do their usual thing in protecting the Chief Executive.

But three contract killers headed by Frank Sinatra are in town to kill the president. We&apos;re never told exactly who is paying for this contract, but the inference is that it is our Cold War enemies. Through a combination of circumstances the sheriff is wounded and the head of Secret Service detail, Willis Bouchey, is killed. And the killers are holed up in Nancy Gates&apos;s house with her, her father-in-law James Gleason, and child Kim Charney and the wounded Hayden.

Most of the film is taken up with the wait for the train to arrive where a lot of souls are bared open, including Sinatra&apos;s. It&apos;s the one and only time that Francis Albert ever essayed the role of an out and out villain. He does it well, but I suspect he didn&apos;t want to push it with his public too much, so he never did anyone as evil as this again.

Of course history tells us that the president named Eisenhower at the time never was an assassin&apos;s target so we know Sinatra&apos;s efforts will fail. However it&apos;s rather ingenious as to how it does fail.

I think more than fans of old Blue Eyes will like Suddenly.",7,"['Crime', 'Drama', 'Film-Noir']","['war widow', 'hostage', 'shoulder holster', 'shoulder', 'holster']",1954-09-17,['Lewis Allen'],"['Frank Sinatra', 'Sterling Hayden', 'James Gleason']",['Richard Sale']

Many compelling characters populate this film: some sad, some funny, all very real. Great cast includes Edie Falco (The Sopranos), Angela Bassett, Timothy Hutton, James McDaniel, Alan King and Mary Steenburgen. Writer/director John Sayles seems (in my view) incapable of making a bad film. As with all filmmakers, some are better than others. This one falls somewhere in the middle. Sayles has made such excellent films in the past: Eight Men Out, Matewan, Lone Star, and Limbo (to name a few), that when he simply makes a good film it can somehow seem a bit disappointing.

It was about a police officer that acquired super powers by witnessing a nuclear explosion. Sure, it wasn&apos;t that original and it was a bit comic bookish, but that is not what made the movie. What made the movie is what he did with his new found super powers that he lost whenever he saw the color red. Oh this movie was hilarious. He did one silly thing after another with his powers all the while he annoyed the heck out of his partner. This was an excellent family movie that was just plain funny.

Superdad,"Father tries to help his daughter meet better friends, only to find his meddling backfires. And finds out that his daughters friends are the best thing for her.","A bit of a mishmash of a film.

It&apos;s messy, the first one is definitely the film&apos;s intended focus but they don&apos;t really develop all of them too well.

The middle one involves Joe Flynn (Hershberger), who is shoehorned into another Disney live-action flick - he is fairly good in &apos;The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes&apos; trilogy, but since the original film of that series in 1969 they really tried to force him into a load of their other releases.

Somewhat likewise to Kurt Russell (Bart), but at least his role is actually integral here. Bob Crane is solid enough in the main role as Charlie, as is Kathleen Cody as daughter Wendy.

Tales of Halloween,"Ten stories are woven together by their shared theme of Halloween night in an American suburb, where ghouls, imps, aliens and axe murderers appear for one night only to terrorize unsuspecting residents.","Well produced anthology, with high values on direction, camera, acting, editing and sound.

The first half seems more coherent, with a scarier vibe and what looks like an editorial rule of having screen shots of Romero&apos;s classic in each one. There&apos;s a definite theme of Grimm&apos;s fairy tales running through it, as kids get sucked into the weird world of Halloween. My favourite was Ding Dong, about a child-craving woman, mostly because it has Pollyanna Macintosh. But the Lin Shaye story, although stylish, seemed a bit unpolished. The first story has a pretty good take on the Exorcist III jump scare, this time running from right to left.

The second half goes more campy head-banger with loads of blood. Eventually the tongue is pushed so hard into the cheek that a little bit comes out the other side.

There&apos;s no wraparound, just a silky female DJ voice with a few nods to The Fog.

Il racconto dei racconti - Tale of Tales,"From the bitter quest of the Queen of Longtrellis, to two mysterious sisters who provoke the passion of a king, to the King of Highhills obsessed with a giant Flea, these tales are inspired by the fairytales by Giambattista Basile.","The royal court roars with laughter. A group of jesters grin and jeer at one another, do cartwheels, breathe fire. In the midst of all this mirth, the Queen sits sad and silent on her throne. Her eyes fall on one of the players and suddenly she runs off, distraught. The King chases after her, shouting that he is sorry, that he did not know. His apologies fall on deaf ears.

So begins Tale of Tales, Matteo Garrone&apos;s visually striking, but ultimately uninspiring adaptation of the Pentamerone, a book of Italian folk stories collected in the 17th century.The film cuts between three separate narrative strands, linked together by the unifying theme of all-consuming obsession. One tale centres around a monarch mad with lust, and two crones in his kingdom who desire only to be young again. Another depicts a woman who will do anything for motherhood. The third tale introduces us to a king&apos;s unhealthy fascination with a flea, and an ogre unable to set free his reluctant and unhappy bride.

Fairy tales these may be, but their delightfully disturbing content ensures that they are not meant for children. (At least by modern, if not by 17th century standards – the Pentamerone, just as full of sex and violence as Garrone&apos;s 15 rated film, was subtitled &apos;Entertainment for Little Ones&apos;). Yet even though Tale of Tales is too graphic and gruesome for kids and is clearly aimed at older audiences, it remains too childishly straightforward to be captivating. I would have needed either more nuance or more mystery and suggestion for the film to draw me in and immerse me in its world. There are, for instance, scenes where characters morph into a different physical shape. Had these transformations remained unexplained by the narrative they would have evoked a sense of wonder and significance, like visual poems hinting at some elusive but compelling underlying idea. Instead, the characters transform because a magician cast a spell, and there is nothing to think about. It is the kind of simple cause and effect storytelling with a clear moral – for all three narrative strands put forward the idea that &apos;obsession is not good for you&apos; – which works so well for children&apos;s stories, but is too obvious to really interest adults.

To be fair, it was never Garrone&apos;s intention to prompt intellectual engagement with Tale of Tales. &apos;Don&apos;t try to understand it. Just feel it, like when you are standing in front of a painting. Follow the characters, take the journey, feel the emotion,&apos; the director said in a Guardian interview. But the characters are too one-dimensional to seem real, and I found it hard to care about their lives or fates. They also speak far too much to function well as figures onto whom one can project emotion, like when one is standing in front of a painting. It should have been show not tell, with the camera lingering on the characters&apos; facial expressions, and allowing spectators to empathise and identify with them. Instead, feelings, from love to longing, are spoken – &apos;He&apos;s like a brother to me&apos;, &apos;I want to be young again&apos; – and the action moves forward.

Less would have been more, with Tale of Tales. The power of the film lies in its visuals, which are beguiling, gorgeous and grotesque. The dialogues and narrative explanations serve only to trivialise the images, lessening the overall effect of the film. The trailer for Tale of Tales, a succession of visuals set to nothing but music,is better than the film itself.",6,"['Drama', 'Fantasy', 'Horror']","['king', 'ogre', 'cunnilingus', 'giant flea', 'circus']",2016-04-22,['Matteo Garrone'],"['Salma Hayek', 'Vincent Cassel', 'Toby Jones']","['Edoardo Albinati', 'Ugo Chiti', 'Matteo Garrone']"

A Taste of Blood,A businessman turns into a vampire after drinking brandy laced with vampire blood and sets out on an odyssey of killing the descendent&apos;s of Dracula&apos;s executioners.,"The director of what is widely considered the first splatter film ever made(Blood Feast) directed this film about a man, through drinking a brandy laced with blood and his ancestral relationship to Count Dracula, that turns slowly into a vampire and begins to kill the relatives of the six men that killed the famous count. If you are looking for the typical Herschell Gordon Lewis trademarks of great quantities of un-realistic blood, super bad acting, gobs of intestines and the like, inferior lighting, and a litany of other flaws in film-making that seem to find such a home in Lewis&apos;s work, you might be disappointed. This is easily Lewis&apos;s best film in terms of direction and acting. The actors in here are average. No small feat for a Lewis film. Even Bill Kerwin(one of Lewis&apos;s regulars) does a decent job! The female lead was also average, and that says a lot for a Lewis film. Usually he just puts pretty girls with no acting talent in his films like Connie Mason, but sexy Elizabeth Wilkinson has some acting talent(albeit not a lot) as well as boobs! Bill Rogers makes an adequate vampire as well. Not only are the actors decent, but the script is interesting. Donald Stanford used some interesting tie-ins with the novel by Bram Stoker for the names of the relatives. I thought it was a fairly unique concept. The film is two minutes shy of two hours, and it is a tad long. It is very apparent though that Lewis wanted to make this film the best that he could. It shows. It shows he has some talent as well. Lewis also has a bit part as a sea captain affecting a working-class English accent. He is pretty good too. There is not much in the line of killing or gore though. The film shows far less blood that you would see in your typical Hammer feature. There are some obvious budget concerns with sets, etc..., but all in all this is a decent film about the vampire myth in a modern setting.",7,['Horror'],"['psychotronic film', 'vampire', 'brandy', 'blood', 'stabbed in the heart']",1967-08-09,['Herschell Gordon Lewis'],"['Bill Rogers', 'Elizabeth Lee', 'William Kerwin']",['Donald Stanford']
Taxi Driver,"A mentally unstable veteran works as a nighttime taxi driver in New York City, where the perceived decadence and sleaze fuels his urge for violent action.","Taxi Driver is one of the best films ever made. This is one of those films that you do not get tired of seeing and every time you watch it you realize a little detail that you have not seen before. Excellent actors, a good director, an impressive soundtrack and a real story are the main appeals of this film.

This film is about loneliness, about the isolation of a man in a society full of scum. His objective is to finish with the scum of the streets. The story uses a taxi driver as a metaphor of loneliness and it has some kind of irony because we can see that a city which is full of people can be the most lonely place for a man. The long nights in the city, the night environment full of whores, junkies, pimps and thieves are the main elements of the world in which Travis Bickle lives. Travis is an misunderstood guy who is seeking desperately for some kind of company because as he says &apos;loneliness has followed me all my life, everywhere&apos; but at the same time he seems not to do anything to avoid his situation and it is seen when he goes with Betsy (Cybill Shepherd) to a porn cinema. At the end of the film the character makes real his most violent fantasies, with a look of certain soldiers from Vietnam, and he behaves like this because of his loneliness, his alienation and because he does not find any sense to his life. The violent behaviour becomes Travis into a hero, although he had killed many people and he could do it again. Although he acts with an extreme violence the spectator understand him and the reasons why he acts that way. The soundtrack of the film, which is composed by Bernard Herrmann, inspires some kind of loneliness and sometimes it is absolutely terrifying like in a horror film. This music and the slow camera showing the streets help to introduce the spectator into the world of Travis, to know what he is thinking about.

In general I cannot say any negative aspect of this film because I have not found anything bad. Although it is a film of the 70s it is not an old-fashioned movie because the essence of the story, the reality that is shown on it, can be perfectly referred to the current society. This film has the privilege of having made famous the sentence You talking&apos; to me? You talking&apos; to me?&apos; which will remain in the history of cinema.

It has several stunning performances that could have easily been cheesy and fake, but are convincing and fascinating. Some say that the dialog is campy. I don&apos;t think so. I&apos;ve seen this movie many times and have never thought so. It&apos;s nothing like the terrible dialog in Plan 9 From Outer Space from the same decade. The romance may be a cliché now, but it was quite original when it first came out and is still interesting.

Terms of Endearment,Follows hard-to-please Aurora looking for love and her daughter&apos;s family problems.,"It&apos;s often a strange experience to revisit a film that made a big splash decades earlier. I remember enjoying it enormously and enjoyed it enormously again last night but the reasons for the enjoyment have changed. The film as a film has remained solidly planted in 1983, specially the score but what will lead this film into the forever ever are the writing of course and the performances. Shirley MacLaine&apos;s truthfulness warts an all is a work of art. She is present one hundred per cent of the time and let&apos;s remember, Shirley MacLaine didn&apos;t start as an actress, she was a dancer who became a star thanks to a twist of fate and she has remained there as an example of honesty and courage ever since. Her Aurora in Terms Of Endearment is a monumental treat. Debra Winger&apos;s performance is a revolution of sorts. Every detail confirms and/or challenges our feelings for her but she&apos;s never less that one hundred per cent truthful. It&apos;s impossible not to love her even if she doesn&apos;t make it easy for you. Jack Nicholson is a terrific interference and every one of his moments have a pleasure of their own. So, a 35 year old movie with a teenager&apos;s heart.",8,"['Comedy', 'Drama']","['cancer', 'dying young', 'extramarital affair', 'terminal illness', 'mother daughter relationship']",1983-12-09,['James L.

Terror in a Texas Town,A Swedish whaler is out for revenge when he finds out that a greedy oil man murdered his father for their land.,"When people discuss the Western in the 50s, the richest decade of the genre, they invariably cite Anthony Mann, Budd Boetticher, THE SEARCHERS or RIO BRAVO . Only the specialised, however, will single out Joseph H. Lewis. A LAWLESS STREET electrifies a banal story with inventive technique. TERROR, though, is something else. I have watched hundreds of Westerns, and I can safely say that this is the most remarkable pre-Peckinpah/Leone effort I&apos;ve seen. It may not be as rich as the above-mentioned, but its formal daring is unparalleled.

Like Mann, Lewis came to the Manichean world of the Western from film noir, a genre defined by its moral ambiguity. The opening sequence is the most astonishing of any Western (except THE WILD BUNCH, of course), and cleverly complicates everything that follows. It starts with the shoot-out, an innovative device, but one of the combatants carries a large pike. His opponent, face unseen, taunts him. The scene is highly charged, even if we don&apos;t know why.

The result of this sequence is cut, and we get the opening credits, featuring an elliptical series of scenes, some lyrically pastoral, others brutally violent, none making any narrative sense because we don&apos;t know the story yet. The film proper hurtles us into a violent arson attack. So in the first five minutes, the viewer is assaulted by sensation and violence. There are none of the reassuring signifiers of the traditional Western - noble music (the score here is as bizarre, inventive and parodic as any Morricone spaghetti); John Wayne or Henry Fonda above the title; contextually explanatory intertitles. We have no idea what is going on, we are left staggered, breathless, excited, reeling.

What follows is an explanation of these events. But the unforgettable effect lingers, and colours what seems to be a traditional Western story - big business trying to muscle in on small farmers. The most interesting figure is not the hero, Sterling Hayden, a gentle man forced by circumstance to find savage violence in himself (and saddled with a ridiculous, faltering Swedish accent, but little character), but the villain. In many ways he is the archetypal baddie - dressed in black, a gun for hire, snarling, brutal with women. But he is also a complex psychological portrait - a once great shot, now a cripple, lush and impotent. The familiar story is subverted to become the tragedy of an evil man. The film&apos;s surface detective element - who killed Hayden&apos;s father - is subsumed thematically by the investigation into this fascinating character (we know early on who killed him anyway).

Stylistically, Lewis turns the Western, traditionally about open spaces, new frontiers, hope, escape, into a bitter male melodrama about entrapment, failure and death. The stark, clear visuals are as beautiful and aesthetically exciting as THE OX-BOW INCIDENT, another morbid masterpiece. The disturbing editing, and exagerrated compositions seem to belong more to Nouvelle Vague deconstructions than a Hollywood Western. Almost as awesome as GUN CRAZY, this is provocative proof that Lewis was a great director.",8,"['Drama', 'Western']","['texas', 'whaler', 'revenge', 'showdown', 'evil landowner']",1958-09-07,['Joseph H.

However this is a terrifying, shocking, emotional thrill of a movie. It may not be up to the standards of the 1970s version, but to be fair, nothing is. The acting is quite well done. The film takes advantage of the time its being made in and the budget, with this version having much better production values, its much more gory but not at the cost of story telling.

The realism is superb and the movie is, at times, as sad as it is scary due to the emotional torture of the characters, i&apos;m sure many people will say its not as good as the original but it could have been a lot worse",8,"['Crime', 'Horror']","['leatherface character', 'leatherface', 'psychopath', 'sadistic horror', 'slaughterhouse']",2003-10-17,['Marcus Nispel'],"['Jessica Biel', 'Jonathan Tucker', 'Andrew Bryniarski']","['Kim Henkel', 'Tobe Hooper', 'Scott Kosar']"

Thale,Estranged friends Leo (a crime-scene cleaner) and hired-hand Elvis are cleaning up a particularly messy casualty deep in the Norwegian woods.

The film is quiet, haunting and has a quality of foreboding which is quite alluring. It is hardly a horror movie and I could only place it in the fantasy genre.

The plot revolves around huldra, seductive creatures from Nordic folklore that seem to be very beautiful women, but are actually forest creatures. As such, the choice of Silje Reinåmo was very wise; she is very pretty. The film feels almost like a filmed play. After all, there are only four actors in total and a voice.

Even if the lead character is supposedly the one driving the story, the movie being seen from his perspective, the one that really made the film feel real and interesting was, in acting and role, his friend, interpreted by Jon Sigve Skard. A phlegmatic character, he underlines the weirdness of the situation by acting totally cool, creating the appropriate contrast.

Over all it was a nice film, although the entirety of it was pretty much about the same thing and something that was already obvious from the beginning. The feel and the fairytale root of the movie are what makes it worth watching.

That Uncertain Feeling,A psychoanalyst causes a woman to doubt her happy marriage.,"Just a quick observation: It is my impression that the reason TUF is such a neglected gem appears to be the unwillingness of audiences, both in 1941 and to this day, to accept Lubitsch&apos;s melding of his own European style with the then-popular American &apos;screwball comedy&apos; genre. I don&apos;t think either the ordinary American audiences who liked their comedy broader, or the European audiences - along with intellectual sophisticates in the US - ever understood, and certainly never accepted, this hybrid.

The Theory of Everything,A look at the relationship between the famous physicist Stephen Hawking and his wife.,"But it does tell an inspiring story about Stephen Hawking&apos;s personal struggle with his illness that&apos;s very uplifting.

The story of Stephen Hawking and his then wife Jane, apparently based on a book she wrote about it, which probability explains why there was not much science in the movie, not that I&apos;m complaining, as it was a well played film about a difficult relationship.

I didn&apos;t known Stephen and his wife actually met around the same time as he began to suffer from Lou Gehrig&apos;s Disease. Makes the whole concept that Hawking has three kids with this woman more interesting (something was working). Felicity Jones did a great job playing such a strong, patient, and compassionate woman, all well narrated in this movie. The difficulty Jane Hawking had being with a man getting trapped in his own body, played by Eddie Redmayne.I have herd of Hawking&apos;s surprisingly positive personality, not because of his condition, but because I expected his condition would make it hard to express any emotion. Redmayne did his research to express the struggle of Hawking on camera nicely (I keep forgetting The Hawking is a Brit).

This movie turned out to be a great one about the time span of a relationship. Done more romantically than borderline soft-core flicks like Blue is the warmest color and 9 songs, and it was not as depressing as Blue Valentine. it was just a true take on a complex relationship taking it&apos;s toll, well performed by some brilliant actors.

If your looking to watch this movie to hear some science talk, that&apos;s not what the movie is really about, unless ironically convincing the world of his theories on time was really as easy as the movie makes it out for Hawking.

They Live by Night,"An escaped convict injured during a robbery falls in love with the woman who nurses him back to health, but their relationship seems doomed from the beginning.","Nicholas Ray made his directorial debut in They Live By Night that&apos;s a little bit Romeo and Juliet and a little bit Bonnie and Clyde. Bonnie Parker will no way recognize Cathy O&apos;Donnell as herself, but The Bard will no way miss seeing her as Juliet Capulet.

As for Farley Granger he was always playing sensitive and misunderstood youths like this one back in his salad days. Ostensibly he starts as an innocent kid convicted for something he didn&apos;t do and is looking for money to get a good lawyer to clear himself.

A pair of rough customers, Howard DaSilva and Jay C. Flippen break out of their prison farm in Mississippi and as Flippen puts it recognize talent when they see it and he&apos;s an investment. If Granger was innocent before he sure isn&apos;t now. But the funny thing is that the media concentrate on Granger&apos;s baby face good looks and dub him as the gang leader. 

While Granger heals up from injuries sustained in the escape he does it at Will Wright&apos;s farm and gas station where he meets Cathy O&apos;Donnell and it&apos;s instant love. But this is passion that will burn hot and fast as this love is no way meant to last.

Ray did remarkably well capturing the doomed nature of the relationship and the people. Even viewing it today by someone who never heard of Bonnie&Clyde or even has seen the classic film. There is such an aura of sadness permeating the entire film from start to finish that even though you know it will end bad, you are drawn to these people.

They Live By Night is one of Farley Granger&apos;s signature roles and a great start for the career of Nicholas Ray.",7,"['Crime', 'Film-Noir', 'Romance']","['lovers on the lam', 'pet dog', 'singing', 'christmas tree', 'sweet potato pie']",1949-11-05,['Nicholas Ray'],"['Cathy O&apos;Donnell', 'Farley Granger', 'Howard Da Silva']","['Charles Schnee', 'Nicholas Ray', 'Edward Anderson']"

They Were Expendable,A Navy commander fights to prove the battle-worthiness of the PT boat at the start of World War II.,"Stirring WWII film, directed by John Ford, about the contributions of the Navy torpedo boat squadron to the war effort. In addition to the action and wartime heroics, there are subplots about the rivalry between Navy lieutenant Robert Montgomery and frustrated subordinate John Wayne, and a romance that blossoms between Wayne and nurse Donna Reed.

Montgomery, a gleeful ham when the role calls for it, offers one of his most subtle and successful performances as the sober squadron commander. Wayne does a great job, as well, playing a character with more layers to him than just a gung-ho war hero. His character is brave, to be sure, but he&apos;s also ambitious to rise in rank and a little petulant. Not attributes one immediately thinks of when they think John Wayne. Reed is lovely and charming as ever.

It&apos;s a little overlong, as many movies over two hours seem to be (then and especially now), but Ford makes the most of it and it never feels padded. Definitely worth a look for Ford and Wayne fans, or anyone who enjoys World War II films. It&apos;s one of the best.",8,"['Drama', 'War']","['u.s. military', 'american colony', 'pacific theater', 'pacific war', 'pacific ocean']",1945-12-31,"['John Ford', 'Robert Montgomery']","['Robert Montgomery', 'John Wayne', 'Donna Reed']","['William L.

Inside, the group not only have to face the apocalypse, but themselves.","I was actually surprised that it was better than I thought it was going to be. I think too many movie-goers hyped it up in their heads that this movie was going to be the most epic comedy of all time. I went in knowing how dumb it was going to be and found it really funny at parts and I liked the dark comedy eased with more immature slapstick comedy. A lot of these negative reviews I&apos;ve read either have some kind of religious agenda against this movie or were people trying to measure how big their cinema knowledge penis is by citing great foreign films and comparing how much it falls short. It&apos;s a stoner comedy made by stoner nerd&apos;s that happened to find success and are probably just as baffled as these harsh critics are as to how they achieved it. In a movie filled with celebrity cameos and over the top CGI and humor, it felt to me like it was still a down to Earth movie they probably spent 30 minutes writing and had a blast filming and getting friends together and showed Hollywood excess from the point of view of the outsiders. If you were offended or wrote this movie off because it wasn&apos;t up to your standards, you&apos;re not the audience this movie had any intention of appeasing. It&apos;s obviously a cult comedy that some will love and most will hate which sometimes are the best comedies.

I think that this is more than a B picture and what people have to remember is the fact that this film was made before all the great advances in special effects. Another thing that made it interesting was the fact that through the first half of the film you really didn&apos;t know if Exeter was human or alien. It wasn&apos;t until the second half of the film that we did see there was more to this mysterious group.

Trois couleurs: Bleu,A woman struggles to find a way to live her life after the death of her husband and child.,"How do we know what it is, essentially, that we liked about a movie? Which is to say, what do we come to know about this viewer who was affected? And what do we say of that experience, do we ascribe it outside of us? No, that&apos;s just a bunch of words.

This is what we have here, questions of memory and meaning. A woman as viewer of a movie taking spontaneous shape around her (played by Binoche as placid observer), that pokes holes in herself and provokes questions; finally overcoming it by being pulled forward by what was left incomplete in it.

A woman who has lost everything as the film begins, every anchor in her life violently removed in one swoop and she&apos;s now cast adrift. We have the whole film as her own inner drift through an interminable flow. Kieslowski evokes this with lush dissonance between visual segments, cuts and fades that leave life in suspense. There is scant story, all about living with these fragments. Music erupts around her in sudden intervals; but music that&apos;s coming from inside of her and being hallucinated.

It&apos;s the world of memory and inner life. Tarkovsky enters this with long, mystifying sweeps of the camera that lift bearings and slip into dreams and ruminations. Kieslowski by contrast caresses their outline, the surface of emotions as they glide over the eyes. It&apos;s not difficult like Tarkovsky or Ruiz can be, but pleasant in the way of Kar Wai. It goes down rather easy, you can see it for just the surface shift.

Kieslowski had spent the whole 10 hours of the Dekalog training this ability to dream in advance. It pays off here. Each of the 10 Dekalogs was about a narrative that an earth-shattering revelation comes along and creates a change in viewing. You will see this here obviously. But Dekalog had a contrast; some of it was Kieslowski opening corridors in the imagining with his camera, most was characters stumbling into revelations and articulating feelings. Here I&apos;m happy to note this tension is resolved in favor of the eye; the whole is about visual slippage through cracks in story.

He lets blue lights shine on screen as music soars in crescendos, he gives us closeup shots of eyes; the eye that colors. At other points he introduces memory as images before a viewer: the funeral playing on a screen, images of her husband on TV that when shuffled through reveal a mistress. Most eloquently, images on TV of someone being cast over a void with a bungee chord as her anxiously precarious drift with nowhere to hold. She&apos;s fading from even the mind of her mother.

For the end he reserves a tableaux of joined moments from lives as they are suspended briefly in mind. It&apos;s all being endlessly relived and combined like the music she works to complete with her composer friend. The music is central here.

Not just as the memory of what was collaboratively lived with her composer husband, the emotion that was absorbed and now erupts again, but also as the sheet where an incomplete piece beckons for the work of continued imagination. The shot of this sheet as scribbled notes end and lines stretch interminably is the abstract heart at the bottom of it.

Had another woman not made a copy of the score, it would have disappeared when she burnt it. Had she come by to pick up the photos of her husband, she might have burnt them with everything else and never found out about the mistress. But it&apos;s all this what eventually pulls her out of herself.",,"['Drama', 'Music', 'Mystery']","['trauma', 'loss of child', 'liberty', 'telling a joke', 'mourning']",1993-09-08,['Krzysztof Kieslowski'],"['Juliette Binoche', 'Zbigniew Zamachowski', 'Julie Delpy']","['Krzysztof Kieslowski', 'Krzysztof Piesiewicz', 'Agnieszka Holland']"

Three Kings,"In the aftermath of the Persian Gulf War, four soldiers set out to steal gold that was stolen from Kuwait, but they discover people who desperately need their help.","I&apos;ve just watched this film two years after umming and arring about going to see it at the flicks when it was released. Two years ago I stayed in with a pizza thinking that George Clooney looking gritty with a load of gold wouldn&apos;t be up to much. Then friends started to talk about it quite positively without really saying much about the content. Then I saw it in a buy 2 get 1 free sale at HMV, and now I know that I needn&apos;t have to gone through all the bother of digesting a pizza.

I should also add that I&apos;m seeing this after 11/9/2001 and that even with the new perspective world events have cast over films with themes involving the US and the middle East, this film stands up very well. A positive portrayal of Islam, a positive portrayal of the people of Iraq, a sort-of-positive portrayal of the US army abroad, hell even a sympathetic portrayal of a lapdog of Saddam (I&apos;m kind of reminded of Happiness for the sheer taboo-bustingness of this portrayal).

The plot is easy on the mind, the acting is satisfactory, the ending is purest Hollywood and the cinematography is sub-Lawrence of Arabia despite having access to a perfectly adequate desert. What makes this movie stand out is how at ease it is with its subject matter; letting comedy mix with the sort of serious politics that make a lot of people pick their words with great care.

The misleading trailer for this film fits in perfectly with what it&apos;s trying to achieve. Pretending to a be a gung-ho, guns and gold, go gettum boys film, it gets those into the cinema who need to hear its message not just those who want to hear. It attempts to slip complex issues through just about all the unthinking jingoism that lingers outside movie theatres on a regular basis and for that I salute it.

Three on a Match,"Although Vivian Revere is seemingly the most successful of a trio of reunited schoolmates, she throws it away by descending into a life of debauchery and drugs.","The title is based on a saying that if three people share a match tragedy follows.

Story of three woman--Mary (Joan Blondell), Vivian (Ann Dvorak) and Ruth (Bette Davis). They are friends in grade school but go their own separate ways--Mary ends up in jail, Vivian marries a wealthy husband and Ruth becomes a stenographer. Ten years after school they meet and share a match--and tragedy follows. There&apos;s a LOT more to this but I won&apos;t spoil it by giving it away.

This moves VERY quickly--so fast that you don&apos;t have time to question some of the more silly aspects of the story. It&apos;s also pretty potent (this was made pre-Code) with some fairly graphic scenes toward the end. The acting is basically pretty good except for Davis. She&apos;s pretty terrible--but this was one of her first films. Even she dismissed this in later years. Blondell however is great and Dvorak is just perfect. She has some difficult scenes to play and pulls them off. Lyle Talbot is also very good (and very handsome) as Michael. There&apos;s also a pre-stardom Humphrey Bogart (looking surprisingly young) playing a vicious hood.

Fast, racy and loads of fun. Just don&apos;t think about it too much afterwards.

I have basically not liked any adaptations of it before.

I have loved this. It is a mix of exactly the book, and not the book at all. The atmosphere is dark, the action is excellent, I was never bored. It is easy to follow even if you don&apos;t know French history, but it is not dumbed down either.

The cast (as per real history and the novel) is FANTASTIC. The story is modernised and completely over the top which corresponds totally to the spirit of Dumas, if not to the actual book (it was way over the top for its time as well) .

You come out of there like you did as a child after watching a swashbuckling movie with Errol Flynn.

My brother cheered loudly like a child, a girl in the audience was crying, all in all, a roaring success in the vein of the very old action movies, but completely modernised with a certain dark steampunk flair.

Thunderball,James Bond heads to the Bahamas to recover two nuclear warheads stolen by S.P.E.C.T.R.E. Agent Emilio Largo in an international extortion scheme.,"Connery is back, better and more buff than ever, as super agent James Bond 007, this time seeing him on a mission in the Bahamas to prevent a nuclear catastrophe from happening. The cinematography is beautiful, as the Bond Girl Claudine Auger, who looks smoking hot in her bikini.

For the acting, Connery is always there to take the spotlight. He zigs and zags his way around friends and foe in order to succeed. He is still the charming, witty, and deadly secret agent we have come to know him for. The villain is also good here, because not only he has one of the most diabolical plans ever, he also looks diabolical (an eye patch).

The action here is non-stop, especially the underwater scenes. Some call these scenes overlong, thus causing the length of the film to be 2 hours and 10 minutes, quite long, but to me, it&apos;s just breathless and pulse-pounding. Also, the beginning of the film will want you begging for more Connery. Most of the action sequences rely on the team&apos;s special effects, but it&apos;s no problem, since the special effects are damn good for a 1965 movie, even by today&apos;s standard. Which is why it deserved to win the Oscar for Best Visual Effects.

Crew also reigns here. Producers Brocolli and Saltzman return once again, as well as Terence Young, director of the first two Bond films. This was his final James Bond film before he went on to direct Audrey Hepburn in her Oscar-nominated performance in the 1967 thriller Wait After Dark. It shows that you have a class filmmaker at the helm. John Barry gives us a beautiful and fast-paced score that mounts up the tension every time.

Overall, probably the most entertaining Bond ever.

Haeundae,"A woman named Yeon-hee (Ha Ji-won) lives in Busan with her boyfriend Man-sik (Sol Kyung-gu) near Haeundae Beach. But, when they find out a tsunami will hit the city, They realize they only have 10 minutes to escape!","This lacklustre disaster flick should have been so good: it features tremendously good special effects scenes of 100-metre high waves tearing through a city, laying waste to anything and everything in their path. These scenes alone are among some of the best bits I&apos;ve ever watched in the whole disaster genre; destruction and mayhem on a massive scale, with carefully-crafted CGI bringing the chaos to full and authentic life.

It&apos;s a shame, then, that the surrounding movie is so poor. Tidal Wave takes an hour to get to the disaster stuff, and until that time we&apos;re treated toKorean comedy. Now, I don&apos;t mind a bit of comedy, the quirkier the better; THE HOST had a lot of fun moments. But this comedy is something else, the comedy of ridiculous characters behaving ridiculously, almost on a sub-slapstick standard. The over-the-top acting is absolutely appalling; I avoid American comedies on principle but this is even worse than those.

Of course, disaster movies always have to build up to the disaster, and I fully understand the need to develop the characters before dropping them in the clag. But, in my mind, the film should always be about the disaster, even before it occurs: have characters making warnings that are unheeded, or build suspense and foreboding with minor events preceding it. DANTE&apos;S PEAK is a case in point of how to achieve this. TIDAL WAVE sits in a completely different, and entirely superfluous, genre until the actual disaster occurs.

Once the chaos gets underway, things get a lot better, although there&apos;s a reliance on overwrought melodrama which will test the patience of even the most hardened viewer, I imagine. Endless scenes of characters facing death, drawn out in painful slow-motion and with maximum crying, screaming, sobbing and telling each other they love them. Such scenes are a personal pet hate of mine, and they threaten to overwhelm the film even when the going gets good. It&apos;s a real shame, as with access to those special effects TIDAL WAVE could have, and should have, been a true great.",4,"['Action', 'Comedy', 'Drama']","['psychotronic film', 'bridge collapse', 'cigarette', 'korea', 'tsunami']",2009-07-22,['JK Youn'],"['Kim Yoo-jeong', 'Ha Ji-Won', 'Lee Min-ki']",['JK Youn']
Tigrero: A Film That Was Never Made,"In 1993, Sam Fuller takes Jim Jarmusch on a trip into Brazil&apos;s Mato Grosso, up the River Araguaia to the village of Santa Isabel Do Morro, where 40 years before, Zanuck had sent Fuller to scout a location and write a script for a ...","The image of hipster Jarmusch and Old-School Fuller wandering around like 2 characters in search of an epiphany was wacky enough. Place them in the middle of a Karaja village, with the amazing back-story of Fuller&apos;s flirtation with a jungle epic-that-never-was, and you&apos;ve got a great little documentary that surpasses expectations--if in fact you had any. It&apos;s true that Jarmusch is absurdly out of place here, but that only ads to the surrealistic bent of the thing. And Fuller, a physical midget next to Jarmusch, is the one who is truly larger than life; a throwback to a time when directors truly dreamed and took action--the sort of character that Hollywood, in its increasing dependence on CGI, has conveniently squelched. We get to see a maverick, a dreamer, an egotist and a great observer of life in its myriad forms, who clearly loved every second of his time on this earth. The film is somewhat hampered by a lack of what a script man would call structure. And yet that didn&apos;t bother me because it was like watching a human circus unfolding: Here a Karaja ritual; there, Fuller fulminating about what coulda been, and everywhere around the amazing Mato Grosso, the real star of the story.

Bud is superb. I didn&apos;t rate his acting in their last couple of films for universal (especially ...meet the keystone Kops) but here, he shines. All of the supporting are great too.

Both Bud and Lou have memorable opening scenes with Bud, the tipsy waitor and Lou asleep on his horse. Good music, great effects and good fun. It has been labelled as an Abbott and Costello film for those who don&apos;t like Abbott and Costello.

Timecop,"Max Walker, an officer for a security agency that regulates time travel, must fend for his life against a shady politician who&apos;s intent on changing the past to control the future.","Timecop is a pretty hilarious movie, and it has all the trademarks of a

Tapert/Raimi film (i.e., the guys who brought you Evil Dead, Hercules,

Xena, Jack of All Trades...). It&apos;s definitely a big-screen movie, but they have some fun, even including dialogue that pokes fun at Jean-Claude&apos;s at times unintelligible accent. There are some decent martial arts set pieces, they don&apos;t spend too long on the time travel aspects (which is about par for the course for the guys who did time travel in Evil Dead, Hercules, and Xena...). Ron Silver makes a suitably sinister villain, but Bruce McGill steals the show as the protagonist&apos;s somewhat befuddled but loyal boss. There are the usual holes that accompany any time travel story, and a weird ending. With the feel-good ending, no one seems to realize that Max won&apos;t recall the last 10 years of his married life and time raising his kid!

Tin Toy,A tin one-man-band toy tries to escape a destructive baby.,"This animated short is about the constantly changing interaction between a toy marching band figure and a baby.

The story is simple but engaging. The marching figure has a mind of its own, first avoiding the terrible baby who terrorises toys (and even the boxes of the toys). When the baby cries, the marching figure decides that he has sympathy and compassion, and bravely goes back out to cheer the baby up. I got alarmed when the baby puts a bag on his head, and I was lifted up by the bravery of the marching figure.

The animation looks sub standard in modern day standards, but when I look back twenty years ago, the 2D animations I watched when I was a child were nowhere as good as this.",,"['Animation', 'Short', 'Family']","['national film registry', 'no music during end credits', 'cg animation', 'toy', 'baby']",1988-12-30,['John Lasseter'],"['Andrés Couturier', 'Mel Blanc']",['John Lasseter']

Reading through earlier comments, i grew a bit weary of hearing about lame script and shallow characters. I went to see a ship sink...the plot and the characters were, at least to me, a kind of icing on the Cake. I actually think a lot of the characters were done well; that is, by the time they die in freezing water, you actually felt a tinge of sadness for them. But , by the time Titanic was over, I was sufficiently moved to make me tell people that it was a great movie. Kate Winslet was good, Kathy Bates was perfect, Leo was ok (I&apos;ll give you people that - I&apos;ve seen him shine like I know he can ... Basketball Diaries, Romeo & Juliet). But ultimately, the Titanic sinks...and it was absolutely stunning. Bravo to Cameron. He didn&apos;t just show us a large ship sinking, he showed us the back half of it crashing down on a hundred freezing, drowning people; he showed us a third class mother attempting to sing her children to sleep because she knew they were all doomed (broke my heart - i cried the most right there at that point), he showed people who worked extremely hard to get OUT of the bowels of the ship only to be sucked back in when a random window shattered and the water carried them on back in...detail.

*** (out of 4) 

Good, if rather routine, documentary about the sinking of the Titanic. The main attraction here is that there were seventeen dives down to the resting site of the ship, all with high tech lights as well as IMAX cameras. Having watched just about every Titanic documentary that I could get my hands on, I was a little confused by the mission of this film. I say that because the start of the movie talks about the various new bits of technology that&apos;s going to allow them to get some of the most amazing footage that has ever been seen of the ship. Great. However, once the film is over you keep asking yourself what exactly did they film for seventeen dives and why is it that so much footage appears to be missing here. The majority of the 67-minute running time (the home video version) is just like any other documentary in that we here about the building up the ship, about some of the passengers and then of course that deadly night when the ship hit the iceberg. We get several images of photos of the ship, newspaper reports and there&apos;s even some interview footage with historians and Eva Hart, a survivor. This is all fine but if the filmmakers were going to brag about this new technology it really does seem that they would have given us more images of the sunken ship and not just the same story. Now, with that said, I understand that some of the story was needed for those unfamiliar with the event but I don&apos;t think this should have been the main focus. When we do get images of the ship there&apos;s no question that they are quite breathtaking. The images are certainly haunting and crystal clear as well.",,"['Documentary', 'History']","['year 1912', '1910s', 'underwater scene', 'titanic', 'one word title']",1995-04-04,['Stephen Low'],"['Leonard Nimoy', 'Steven Biel', 'Steve Blasco']",[]

That&apos;s confusing to me, as it seems a lot of care was put into producing this. Some people seem to have a problem with the animation, but I kind of like it. It&apos;s more of a comic-book art style full of gore and murder, and that appeals to me a lot more than Japanese animation does, even if the excessive blood isn&apos;t exactly what I look for in a movie.

The Tomb of Ligeia,A man&apos;s obsession with his dead wife drives a wedge between him and his new bride.,"I was asked recently if I could name any genuinely scary films made before The Exorcist in 1973. The only titles I could come up with were Rosemary&apos;s Baby and Night of the Living Dead from the late &apos;60s. I could suggest many horror titles made before 1970, but none were genuinely flesh-crawling enough to make the list. At the time, I had not seen The Tomb of Ligeia. Now I have seen it and, wow! This is one seriously under-rated gem.

It is one of the many Roger Corman films from this era based on an Edgar Allan Poe story. Intelligently scripted by Robert Towne, and acted to perfection by Vincent Price and Elisabeth Shepherd, this film is a treat from start to finish. Shepherd plays a well-to-do lady in Victorian England who falls in love with a mysterious loner (Price) who resides in a crumbling abbey and seems haunted by memories of his previous (now-dead) wife Ligeia. She marries Price, but her chances of love are blighted by spooky happenings which may be the work of the ghost of his jealous ex-bride.

The dream sequence, featuring a dead fox hidden in a bouquet of flowers and a terrifying metamorphosis midway through a passionate kiss, is a marvellous and memorable scene. All scenes featuring the weird black cat are eerily effective. There&apos;s also a wonderfully creepy hypnotism episode. The photography is lovely, with colourful outdoor lensing of a real English abbey and superb blending of light and shadows during the ghostly indoor sequences.

So, if you&apos;re after a truly spine-tingling film from before 1970 - here you go!",,"['Drama', 'Horror', 'Thriller']","['19th century', 'black cat', 'tombstone', 'riding accident', 'presumed dead']",1965-01-20,['Roger Corman'],"['Vincent Price', 'Elizabeth Shepherd', 'John Westbrook']","['Edgar Allan Poe', 'Robert Towne', 'Paul Mayersberg']"
Tomboy,"A family moves into a new neighborhood, and a 10-year-old named Laure deliberately presents as a boy named Mikhael to the neighborhood children.","Laure, the tomboy of the title, moves because of Dad&apos;s job to a new neighbourhood and has to negotiate the minefield of finding new friends. With her short-cropped hair and boyish looks, it is easy for Laure to pass herself off as a boy. So she does. Existing as Mikael, she digs a hole deeper and deeper for herself during summer holidays. With the start of school approaching, friendships made and romances embarked upon, something has to give.

The film works in large part due to the casting. Zoé Héran as Laure / Mikael is so convincing as a boy that when she does finally don a dress it just looks... wrong. A double for a young Sting, she has an easy charisma and strong expression that makes her every move unmissable. Mikael is befriended by Lisa, a precocious Jeanne Disson, and young love blossoms in bizarre circumstances. As strong as these two performances are, Malonn Lévana Malonn as Laure&apos;s little sister Jeanne steals every scene she is in. Given a secret to keep half-way through, she crackles and delights every time you see her and wonder if she can keep the confidence.

As delightful as the children are, the theme of a young girl yearning to be a boy is presented but hardly explored. The film is episodic, one summer in the life of a mixed up girl. Laure&apos;s reasons for taking things so far are never dealt with beyond surface levels, and no resonance to wider concerns in society are present. The narrative strains with such insubstantial fare, but never breaks. Fans of such coming-of-age tales as Stand By Me or Yamada&apos;s Village of Dreams will enjoy this tale.",7,['Drama'],"['tomboy', 'soccer', 'looking at oneself in a mirror', 'false name', 'child protagonist']",2011-04-20,['Céline Sciamma'],"['Zoé Héran', 'Malonn Lévana', 'Jeanne Disson']",['Céline Sciamma']

The Bond films are both hit and miss as well as an acquired taste. And each time there is a new Bond, people readjust and some people just will not move on. Personally, I think Brosnan was a great Bond, and I actually think this is one of the best films in the series, contrary to popular opinion.

Much of the series is either about Soviet issues or post-Soviet issues. This one, however, is about global media dominance. Now 20 years old, it seems more appropriate than ever with its satellites and cell phones.

Tooth and Nail,A group of people in a post-apocalyptic world fight to survive against a band of vicious cannibals.,"Tooth and Nail is yet another film handling the idea of the majority of the population being killed off and the rest living in a barren wasteland. There are plenty of these films about, and most of them are better than this one as Mark Young&apos;s film adds nothing new to the concept and as such is really disappointing. The film does actually benefit from a very well done atmosphere - most of it takes place at night and the director constantly enforces the idea that the central characters are in a hopeless situation. However, the good things about it end there. As mentioned, the film takes place in the future and we focus on a group of people (lead by a college professor) that have holed up in an old abandoned hospital. Of course they plan to rebuild civilisation from the ground up; but their plan hits a stumbling block when they come across another gang of survivors. This gang calls themselves &apos;The Rovers&apos; and just happen to be cannibals. Naturally, our group find themselves on the menu and have to fight to survive.

Mark Young&apos;s screenplay is really weak. The characters are all non-entities and many lines of dialogue are awful, which doesn&apos;t exactly help. The film does not feature even nearly enough tension or suspense and spends far too much time focusing on bickering within the central group; which is at times painful since none of the lead actors can act. Even when the film does start to feature a bit more action; it&apos;s not well filmed or exciting. Most of the cast is made up of unknown performers, but there are three exceptions, in the form of Robert Carradine, Vinnie Jones and Michael Madsen; who have small and rather ineffective roles. There are a few gory scenes in the film, but nothing to write home about. It&apos;s really a shame that the film turned out like this as while there are a lot of post-apocalyptic films about; this type of film can be really well done if handled correctly. The ending is fairly good and the little twist at the end is nice; but overall this is not good horror and represents yet another underwhelming entry in Afterdark&apos;s &apos;8 Films to Die For&apos; collection.",5,"['Drama', 'Horror', 'Thriller']","['child uses a gun', 'child', 'gun', 'child in jeopardy', 'weightlifting']",2007-10-16,['Mark Young'],"['Michael Madsen', 'Vinnie Jones', 'Rachel Miner']","['Jonathan Sachar', 'Mark Young']"
El Topo,A mysterious black-clad gunfighter wanders a mystical Western landscape encountering multiple bizarre characters.,"It&apos;s a violent, brutal, to some confusing, but fascinating and ultimately a brilliant allegorical film. It was the first of the midnight cult films.

Unrelenting at times. There are several characters and situations the protagonist experiences. Each of these characters and situations have a connection to various (mostly Eastern) religions. The feel of the first part is almost like a mid-period Fellini spaghetti western (had Fellini made a spaghetti western--which he did not). The second half of the film has an entirely different feel, message and pacing. The second half of the film is an allegory of the New Testament. Eventually it does all tie together however.

There seems to be a scene missing at about the mid-point of the film, and a characters motivation suddenly changes. Jodorowsky explained it was mostly intentional, but, two shots were ruined and never re-shot which would have helped set up a more discernible meaning to the scene in question. It occurs between the women in the desert.

Jodorowsky will not explain in detail all that he was going for in the film. He considers the film an Eastern.... he agrees that my interpretation of various characters embodying Eastern religion and philosophy is correct. He also was creating a film of emotions, violence, salvation, and redemption---so he intentionally did not follow the expected structure of most films regarding first, second and third acts and when major conflicts occur.

He flippantly agreed with some New York critics years ago who described the film as one which seemed to be a filmed version of a very strange L.S.D. trip. He had a lengthy conversation which was published and used as liner notes in the El TOPO soundtrack album which talked about the film in terms of it being something akin to a LSD trip. But Jodorowsky said, you certainly don&apos;t need LSD to enjoy it, it&apos;s already been done for you.

This was not something he was serious about it. But being 1969, and after having trouble getting a distributor for the film in the first place, and now watching the film having moderate success as a midnight cult film and amongst college students he decided it was good for the film to agree that the N.Y. critics were partially correct.

It is at times an extremely disturbing film. I thought I detected more than a little of misogyny in the film-- --however, as Jodorowsky essentially told me--none has been intended, except that the world now, like in the past, has always brutalized women and men have insisted on brutalizing themselves.

Seeing it with an audience in a theater also means you can discuss it with people of all types. Reactions to the film are all over the map. Most agree it is art---- many don&apos;t like the film---many find it too disturbing, too violent, too sacrilegious, too scattered. Others disagree over the various messages and meanings they receive from the film. Others just &apos;enjoy&apos; it as a wild, weird, disturbing film.

Usually video copies of the film are from Japanese laserdiscs which fog all pubic hair. It looks strange if you are not familiar with this.

It is a film akin to an Opera. Although it was extremely low-budget, the film is an epic and has, if not a big budget feel to it, an impressive grandeur and sweep that few films achieve.

Filmed over a course of nearly three years, the filmmakers twice were stranded for weeks without supplies and without money. This film was started in 1964/65, completed and originally set for release in 1967/68, it predates The Wild Bunch, Easy Rider and other 60&apos;s landmarks.... It was a true labor of love to finish the film. And then the film was banned in several countries.

It is not in general release. For many years from the late 70&apos;s to the mid 90&apos;s it was rarely if ever shown.

A few years ago I revisited the film in a theatre and had the opportunity to discuss it as an audience member and later on one with Jodorowsky. His other film Sante Sangre is also quite good in my opinion, but I am not a fan of his Holy Mountain. Other films he has been involved with are of lesser value. He was a good friend of Fellini&apos;s and may someday direct Fellini&apos;s script of Don Quixote. He is working on Son of El Topo, but not sure when it will be released and who will distribute it.

El Topo began a nearly 5 year run as a midnight film and often sold out. It started in a small Greenwich Village theatre in New York City. After a few years of success in NYC, other prints were distributed to college campuses and for midnight shows in other cities. It became a modest hit!",10,"['Drama', 'Western']","['revenge', 'self immolation', 'murder', 'church', 'written and directed by cast member']",1971-04-15,['Alejandro Jodorowsky'],"['Alejandro Jodorowsky', 'Brontis Jodorowsky', 'José Legarreta']",['Alejandro Jodorowsky']

Tourist Trap,A group of young friends stranded at a secluded roadside museum are stalked by a masked assailant who uses his telekenetic powers to control the attraction&apos;s mannequins.,"After many of my friends recommended this to me, I figured I had to check it out, so I bought the (relatively) new Blu-Ray release, settled in for the night, and checked it out. To my surprise, Tourist Trap lives up to its hype and then some. One can see why it never became a huge mainstream success like, say, Jaws or Halloween, but it has all the makings of a cult classic.

The set up is nothing spectacular. In fact, it owes a lot of its plot to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Psycho, and House of Wax (even more surprising, the 2005 remake of that film is more of a remake of Tourist Trap than the &apos;53 film). What makes this one stand out from the then growing slasher genre is a sense of the surreal, the dreamlike, and the nightmarish. Attractive teens aren&apos;t just killed one by one by some creep in a mask. There&apos;s a lot more at play here than your average stalk &apos;n slash flick. By the last 20 minutes of the film, everything seems like a bizarre fever dream and hope is a thing of the past.

A lot should be said for Jocelyn Jones&apos; wonderful performance - going from kind wallflower to woman in the process of a nervous breakdown. Chuck Connors is also terrific as Mr. Slausen, the owner of the titular Tourist Trap whose motives seem to always be up in the air. And yes, that&apos;s future Charlie&apos;s Angel, Tanya Roberts, as one of the other victims.

For those looking for something creepy and different, Tourist Trap delivers in spades. Perfect for a Halloween party or even for a kid&apos;s first horror film (it is rated PG after all).",8,['Horror'],"['mannequin', 'mask', 'skinny dipping', 'slasher', 'violence']",1979-03-16,['David Schmoeller'],"['Chuck Connors', 'Jocelyn Jones', 'Jon Van Ness']","['David Schmoeller', 'J.

The Town That Dreaded Sundown,,"A remake of a film that acknowledges the original&apos;s existence (and even implies it what an insensitive film to make) - now there&apos;s an interesting idea. Or at least a bold idea. It&apos;s not the first film to have done it, I know &apos;The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence)&apos; in 2011 played around with the same concept and I&apos;m certain it would have been done before that. For some reason though it just leaves a bit of a sour taste in my mouth. It&apos;s like a different form of breaking the fourth wall. If you acknowledge the existence of film inside a film that&apos;s fine, it obviously happens all the time. But to directly acknowledge the series of films you are currently making just cheapens the whole experience and makes me wonder why I should care. To be fair though the film itself didn&apos;t really make me care anyway.

The whole thing is a bit of a mess. The victims are stupid, the cops are possibly even dumber and the kills feel rushed and never go on long enough to build any real suspense. Numerous times we are introduced to characters only moments before their imminent death. There are two flaws with this, one being that we can be certain that they are going to be victims because suddenly out of nowhere they have been awkwardly brought into the film like lambs to the slaughter, and secondly because we couldn&apos;t care less for the characters. We have no connection with them. Similar films like &apos;Scream&apos; at least put some time and effort into the one scene their victim may have in an attempt to make us feel compassion for the character. That one scene can be enough if done right, but it certainly wasn&apos;t here.

The &apos;whodunnit&apos; side of things is done well enough, I certainly didn&apos;t pick it. That&apos;s really about all this has going for it though. They really kept the runtime short at 86 minutes. I feel even another five minutes could have done the world of good just to extend some of the kill scenes and build characters a fraction more. It&apos;s certainly not unwatchable, but in a genre that has been quite stale for a while now is this adding anything new?

Traffic,"A conservative judge is appointed by the President to spearhead America&apos;s escalating war against drugs, only to discover that his teenage daughter is a crack addict. Two DEA agents protect an informant. A jailed drug baron&apos;s wife ...","Traffic is a fantastic movie. Let&apos;s start with saying that.

I just got back from seeing it, and it certainly rates as one of the best story-based drama&apos;s I&apos;ve ever seen. Being a big fan of movies with different storylines overlapping (as Magnolia) I was highly anticipating this movie. And of course the big oscar nominations and the prizes it already won made it even more desirable.

It didn&apos;t let me down one bit. The different story&apos;s were all excellent. Being that the mexican one was in my opinion the best one. Especially Benicio Del Toro (remember him in Fear and Loathing in Las vegas, the BEST drugs movie ever) being absolutely brilliant. But also the storyline involving Michael Douglas with his problems dealing with a daughter on drugs (well acted out by newcomer Erika Christensen) is remarkable. The topic drugs is clearly highly talked about especially in the United States, and this is actually the first movie which shows all aspects of it. The dealing and smuggling, the addiction, the risks of being a narcotics agent and the political point of view. It&apos;s hard to find a film that&apos;s so complete, everyone will feel connected to one of the storylines because everyone deals with or has dealt with drugs before, even if it&apos;s just a one time mariuhana use. That&apos;s why this movie will appeal to a very large crowd.

Anyway when you look at the flaws then maybe some will say that it takes too long, or that some of the scenes are a bit slow. But does everything go fastpaced in real life? It just tries to sketch a realistic view of handling with drugs. And maybe there isn&apos;t a lot of action going on, but that&apos;s not the goal of the movie.

The only thing I found when watching the movie was that the switching between movielines happened a little too often. I&apos;d preferred if it stayed with one story a little longer. Just a tiny flaw that I personally noted.

Traffic is a film that has to sink in, when you start to think about it it just gets better and better. I can&apos;t wait for the official release here in Holland, so that I can see it again.

Oscar for Del Toro in any case !!!!!! And throw in an oscar for best film too.

Trailer Park Boys: The Movie,"Ricky, Julian, and Bubbles come up with a scheme to steal large amounts of untraceable coins.","Trailer Park Boys: The Movie is a feature length film of the television series Trailer Park Boys. Seeing as the ads and the film&apos;s trailer give away virtually nothing that will spoil the film I have decided not to give a plot synopsis and besides fans of the television series should know what they are in for and what to expect from the film. I first started watching the television show back in the fall of 2005 and only after a few episodes I was hooked and have been watching it ever since even if the episodes are re-runs. The show itself is like a comedy soap opera. In the first couple of episodes we are introduced to the main characters and more as the series goes on. The characters go through various humorous situations and some real life problems as well. Many would dismiss the show and call it vulgar and unappealing due to the language in the series and the occasional drug use and mild violence. To me while watching this show the three main characters Ricky, Julian and Bubbles grew on me and I started to like them and there were times when they would make me laugh and times when I would feel genuinely sorry for them. The series also has some of the most interesting side characters of any series I have ever seen as well. What I like about the show so much is that it is almost always constantly funny and keeps a smile on my face even if I have seen the same episode over and over again. The show is always entertaining and intriguing and never loses steam not even for a second. Also the show has a lot of heart. Family and friends are really important to these guys and deep down they care for each other and try to take care of one another and there are some episodes that are downright touching and heart warming. I &apos;am pleased to say that everything I liked about the series is there in this full length movie. The same great characters and side characters are there, there is humour, there is heart and it is entertaining from start to finish and it&apos;s just like watching a full length episode of the series, so overall I was not disappointed. If you are a fan of the television show then I can see no reason why you would not like the movie. And on the other hand if you are not a fan of the series the chances are great that you will not like the movie either. If you are however interested in the movie I do suggest you watch the show first to get acquainted with the characters and all the different things they have been through. The show is still on television and if you don&apos;t get that particular station you can find the episodes on DVD. Trailer Park Boys is one of my favourite television shows on the air right now, so seeing as the movie is just like the show or maybe even better than I&apos;m sure you can understand why I loved this movie and consider it to be one of the best films of 2006. I applaud the cast and crew for making a great series and pulling off an excellent movie as well. Good job guys you made something great and fans like me will not be disappointed by this movie and like I said earlier it is one of the best films of the year and one of the best recent comedies of the last few years as well.",10,"['Comedy', 'Crime']","['jock strap', 'stoner comedy', 'alliance atlantis', 'nunchaku', 'five word title']",2006-10-06,['Mike Clattenburg'],"['Robb Wells', 'John Paul Tremblay', 'Mike Smith']","['Mike Clattenburg', 'Robb Wells']"

This film excels because of the way it leads the viewer down a dirty dusty path, with a wonderful twist just where you don&apos;t expect it.

As always - Excellent Scenery, even the animals have their own little cameos.

There is plenty of drama, and enough suspense to keep up concentration levels

There are the usual little two way quips, and enough dialogue to paint a clear enough background to the key characters.

Ben Johnson is his usual dry character, Rod Taylor plays a likable delayed adolescent, Ann Margret fills her part amply!

Tremors,Natives of a small isolated town defend themselves against strange underground creatures which are killing them one by one.,"This movie caught me by surprise: I worked in a video store, and one day we got a preview tape of this movie, prior to its video release. I hadn&apos;t heard much about it, so I watched it, and was quite surprised at how enjoyable it was. Since then, I have seen the movie about ten more times (at least), and still get a kick out of it.

Tremors is basically a landlocked variation on &apos;Jaws&apos; and those 1950s giant bug movies: the isolated town of Perfection, Nevada (population 16), finds itself under seige by four monstrous, subterranean wormlike creatures, that hunt by sensing vibrations in the ground. The plot revolves around the townspeople trying to outwit and escape the creatures (dubbed &apos;Graboids&apos;), which are tearing the town out from under them.

What really makes the movie work is the characters: all of them come across as real people trapped in an insane situation, and all have a lot of charisma, even though the film doesn&apos;t have tons of character development. Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward are a hoot as a pair of low-rent handymen who become reluctant heroes. The byplay between the two is a lot of fun.

Usually movies like this revolve around stupid people doing stupid things, just to raise the body count. Tremors is different: the characters react believably, and do smart things to try and escape and/or kill the Graboids. The creatures too are also fairly smart, and are not just mindless eating machines with no brains.

Given its premise, Tremors is not a gory or violent film (although it has a couple of minor gross bits), and has a very good sense of humor. The film-makers are aware of their far-fetched premise (a couple of key questions go unanswered), but they treat it with respect and a certain amount of affection.

Tremors didn&apos;t have much life in theaters, but has become something of a &apos;Midnight Movie&apos; on home video, with definite cult possibilities. Check it out, and don&apos;t be surprised if you end up buying it.",,"['Comedy', 'Horror']","['desert', 'monster', 'giant worm', 'stranded on rooftop', 'first part']",1990-01-19,['Ron Underwood'],"['Kevin Bacon', 'Fred Ward', 'Finn Carter']","['S.S.

Troma&apos;s War,"A group of assorted Americans survive a plane crash in a Caribbean island, and discover it is infested with crawling snakes and other venomous beasts. Even worse, terrorists are preparing a full out war on America with a biologica...","If you begin to watch a Troma offering, you know you&apos;re in for basically deliberately inept, silly (lazy? Never!) film making to the extent that it&apos;s &apos;so bad it&apos;s good&apos; is expected, since because that is surely the intention of the Troma oeuvre, anyway:

So, if not to be another why waste ya time to watch, then first I would suggest you set it up as a fun billing along with others, not of the classic Arnold/ Sly more serious war is macho genre, but rather those of similar - but unintentionally so, though - dross of the likes of the S. Seagal and/or C. Connors entries into the genre. 

Then as settling in for the inevitable ineptness, parts I found fun were the constant jewellery wearing air crash survivors (dangly spangly earrings especially) and the fact that the island army is surely made up of extras who were told to bring their own approximations of military outfit gear: the incongruities displayed are legion.

Of them, you can then also get a fine appreciation of the stunts people in executing their chops, be it jumping (mostly backwards) over objects (sandbags, oil drums, other &apos;dead&apos; compatriots) or putting themselves in the correct position to plummet, &apos;shot and dead&apos;, from high places, trees especially: and, around the middle an amusing Arnold accent take rant in favour of the corrupt (US!) system but then soon after a quite rather prescient almost &apos;conspiracist theory&apos; the terrorist threat is really from inside from the system elite rejoinder from the hero (i.e well written scriptwriters): Then, throughout the interminable battles, there is a great wailing guitar background soundtrack to enjoy, too by which to get you finally to the end, at which point having so sat through such deliberate tosh, I would implore you wait around until the last end credit has rolled: it&apos;s a great denouement to the &apos;seriousness&apos; of all that&apos;s gone before, making it, really, inarguably, surely one of Troma&apos;s best entries.",5,"['Action', 'Adventure', 'Comedy']","['parody', 'blood splatter', 'war veteran', 'kicked in the groin', 'social satire']",1989-11-18,"['Michael Herz', 'Lloyd Kaufman']","['Carolyn Beauchamp', 'Sean Bowen', 'Rick Washburn']","['Lloyd Kaufman', 'Mitchell Dana', 'Eric Hattler']"
Tromeo and Juliet,"Tromeo, a filmmaker, falls in love with Juliet, the daughter of a former partner who tried to steal his business from him.","Once upon a time, Troma, the company that brought us cinema classics such as: The Toxic Avenger, Rabid Grannies, Poultrygeist, Redneck Zombies and Surf Nazis Must Die, decided long ago to adapt Shakespeare&apos;s famous play, &apos;Romeo and Juliet.&apos; This adaptation decided to spice up the story by adding kinky sex, extreme violence, genital monsters, body piercing and incest and it succeeded in creating a bizarre yet hilarious film. Anyone going into a Troma production should know what to expect, and that is irreverent and perverse comedy with plenty of political incorrectness. Expect plenty of nods to other Troma films and plenty of re-used gags (flipping cars and head squashing). Many may think it sounds like utter crap that only morons would find funny...they may be right, but at the same time they may need to lighten up and enjoy the insanity and mind-numbingness that is Tromeo and Juliet.

With a great cast, a funny script (by James Gunn and Lloyd Kaufman), a fitting soundtrack and plenty of great visual gags, Kaufman has yet again succeeded in turning what is right upside down and grossing the hell out of everyone. Get some popcorn, grab a beer, invite your friends over and enjoy Tromeo and Juliet for what it is, a Shakespeare adaptation with plenty of balls. The end.

Comedy horror mostly pisses me off, but this is a great idea. The genre is splashed all over the screen and, although a bit coy on the sex, this should hit the spot for experienced fans of US slasher movies. Myself, I can&apos;t ref the films or actresses. 

Clunky production that gets into its stride, and I liked the performances as it went along. Dialogue and editing a bit slow, so the humour sometimes fails to spark and a lot of jokes are left at the table, but the pace is good. Favourite scene was at the audition, where the actors get to play it up. Plus the ending doesn&apos;t disappoint.

It also hits a good note on the nostalgia of a film fan - the first reaction to watching a movie recedes, the regret becomes overwhelming. Kill it before it dies. Mom! 

Overall - low rent, dirty irony, but lack of sharps on the sleaze and humour.",6,['Horror'],"['tape over mouth', 'nudity', 'female nudity', 'female topless nudity', 'knocked unconscious']",2014-06-04,['Charles Band'],"['Adam Noble', 'Maria Olsen', 'Brinke Stevens']","['Charles Band', 'Neal Marshall Stevens']"
Tropical Rainforest,"A spectacular and unforgettable journey into the heart of the remote and far-flung rainforests of Australia, Costa Rica, French Guiana and Malaysia, this globally important adventure explores these disappearing jungle habitats and...","1992&apos;s &apos;Tropical Rainforest&apos; immediately appealed to me prior to watching. Absolutely love nature documentaries (have done ever since seeing David Attenborough&apos;s groundbreaking work for the first time when they first aired) and it is always wonderful seeing the tropical rainforest which has always fascinated and visually captivated. Not to mention its beautifully varied wildlife, familiar and not so familiar. Interesting to hear Geoffrey Holder, best known to me for his roles in &apos;Live and Let Die&apos; and &apos;Annie&apos;, narrating.

As to be hoped this is absolutely wonderful and lived up to high expectations. It may not be one of the best documentaries ever made, but it was great to see a documentary that focused specifically on the tropical rainforest, the inhabitants and the dangers they have to face when it can usually be seen as part of an episode of a 3 plus part documentary series. It does do a great job in this respect and when it comes to documentaries on rainforests it is a must see.

My only issue is the length, as it does feel too short like many of the recently seen IMAX documentary short films. With a lot of content, this could very comfortably have been 20 minutes longer perhaps which would have given the viewer more time to take in the information and also learn more.

Otherwise, this is fabulous. It looks absolutely great for one thing, with both beautiful and unforgiving scenery and especially the photography that leaves one in awe at its best. There is though more to &apos;Tropical Rainforest&apos; than cute animals and plants in beautiful environments, one is reminded without being preached at that there are daily challenges.

Expectedly there is some messaging, but it is as relevant today as it was back then, so it is hardly outdated. It also makes its point quite powerfully and thoughtfully, was very worried about it being preachy but there are documentaries that are a million times worse at that. The music, with an accessible style, is relaxing in some parts while having some edge in other parts. The animals and plants are a great mix of adorable, formidable and exotic and their behaviors and ways to survive are relatable, surprising and inspiring.

When it comes to the information, it is very educational and the narration entertains and informs without preachiness or being gimmicky, any familiar content is approached freshly, and in a way that will captivate and never disturb kids while not being cookie cutter. Holder does a good account of himself in the narrator role, it is true that there is some stumbling initially, but he mostly narrates warmly and in a way that never sounds bored or over eager.

True Confessions,"A worldly ambitious monsignor clashes with his older brother, a cynical Los Angeles homicide detective who is investigating the brutal murder of a young prostitute.","I had seen this excellent film when it was first released over 20 years ago. I had forgotten about it completely and came across it on the mystery channel recently. When it first came out I recall that no less a personage than William F. Buckley - not normally in the film reviewing business - raved about it.

Having just seen it again, I am astonished at what a superb film this is, and that I could have forgotten it. Consider the credits - Joan Didion as writer, and Robert Duvall, Robert deNiro, Charles Durning and Burgess Meredith.

Those expecting simply a crime story will be disappointed, for the horrific murder that is the centerpiece of the movie is nothing more than, in Hitchcock&apos;s term, a &apos;McGuffin&apos; on which to hang a richly human tale of corruption, guilt, brotherly conflict and devotion, and redemption. The portrayal of the necessary compromises that even good institutions - e.g. The church - must make to exist and operate in the world is as good a portrayal of the essential sinfulness of the human condition as any. In fact I feel that it is impossible for anyone without at least some semblance of religious sensibility to appreciate the true character of this movie.

The period setting and flavor is excellent and the production values are superb. Contrary to viewers who were bored I could not tear myself away from the screen.

Beginning in Detroit and ending in Mexico, a loner that never really made his mark on the world meets a call girl who falls as deeply in love with him as he does with her. Filled with drugs, gangsters, Hollywood and of course romance, the movie&apos;s story becomes only stronger as the movie goes on.

With exceptional performances by Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken (the scene they share is without equal), Gary Oldman and Christian Slater, the action and violence only help to develop the plot and accentuate it&apos;s intricacies.

Twice-Told Tales,,"Twice-Told Tales is a trio of horror stories based on the writings of Nathaniel Hawthorne. Each story stars horror maestro Vincent Price, and this allows the man to show his range in a series of different roles throughout the film. All of Price&apos;s roles allow him to show his dark side, but it&apos;s the way that he is allowed to show this that makes each one stand out. Vincent Price is my favourite horror actor, and he&apos;s arguably the best ever. The fact that he stars in each segment of this film is reason enough alone to see it. The fact that every tale is good is another one. In true omnibus style, the first story is the least memorable; but it&apos;s still well worth seeing. We follow two friends who discover a virgin spring in the crypt of one of their loves. This story is good because it follows the ever-present dream of ever-lasting life. The way that the plot builds is somewhat predictable, but still good as we get to see the great horror master turn his performance around from do-gooder to something more sinister. Not the best opener to an omnibus film; but a long way from the worst.

The second story is by far the best and, in a way, it&apos;s a shame that this story was a part of the omnibus. The second tale is a fairytale horror story of love, protection and madness and follows the tale of an overbearing father that takes steps to ensure that his daughter doesn&apos;t sin like her mother did. This story is a variation on the classic &apos;Romero and Julliet&apos; story, and takes in all the tragedy of that tale by its conclusion. Tale number two is highly original and would make this film worth viewing even if the other two tales were absolute rubbish (which, of course, they&apos;re not). The third and final segment is the weakest of the trio, but still manages an excellent Gothic style and a solid story. The reason it&apos;s the weakest is mainly because it&apos;s really slow; but once it gets started, this tale of greed, witchcraft and murder provides a satisfying end to this trio of stories. With a running time of two hours, Twice-Told Tales is a very long omnibus; and it could have done with being a bit shorter. However, this doesn&apos;t harm it too much, and if you&apos;re a fan of sixties horror, and/or Vincent Price, this will be a must see.",8,"['Horror', 'Mystery', 'Romance']","['based on short story', 'usa horror host', 'usa male horror host', 'male horror host', 'psychotronic film']",1963-10-30,['Sidney Salkow'],"['Vincent Price', 'Sebastian Cabot', 'Brett Halsey']","['Nathaniel Hawthorne', 'Robert E.

Director Sergio Leone&apos;s unique use of the camera - long, uninterrupted shots in wide angle alternating with extreme close-ups - and Ennio Morricone&apos;s unique, wildly inventive soundtrack are blended to perfection. The career-making performances by Eli Wallach (hilarious), Lee Van Cleef (chilling) and Clint Eastwood (cool) are nothing short of iconic, and the film&apos;s finale is so good it will send shivers of cinematic joy down your spine. It&apos;s a movie of epic proportions; it&apos;s funny and violent, but underneath it all there is a strong anti-war message. It&apos;s a cinematic masterpiece and one of the most influential movies of all time. Oh, and it&apos;s also tons of fun, and you should see it on the biggest screen possible. 10 stars out of 10.

Uncle Sam,"Desert Storm vet who was killed in combat rises from the grave on July Fourth, to kill the unpatriotic citizens of his hometown, after some teens burn an American flag over his burial site.","This movie should have been made 10 years earlier...it&apos;s a perfect &apos;80s horror flick. It&apos;s a silly romp, which will have you laughing due to it being ridiculous. There&apos;s not much violence/gore, but a perfect B-movie. If you&apos;re gonna watch a horror movie, make sure it&apos;s a B-movie. Simple plot: a sadistic army soldier is shot down in his helicopter by &apos;friendly fire&apos; by his fellow soldiers. I suppose due to revenge, he goes after anti-americans...flag burners, draft-dodgers, & his ex-wife. Did I mention that he dresses up as Uncle Sam while he does this? Isn&apos;t this alone worth watching it?",6,"['Comedy', 'Horror']","['flag burning', 'buried alive', 'hanged boy', 'coffin', 'cannon']",1997-07-04,['William Lustig'],"['William Smith', 'David &apos;Shark&apos; Fralick', 'Christopher Ogden']",['Larry Cohen']
Sous le sable,"When her husband goes missing at the beach, a female professor begins to mentally disintegrate as her denial of his disappearance becomes delusional.","Mr. Ozon seems to understand a woman&apos;s pysche pretty well. This movie shows the impact of disappearance of a loved one suddenly & without any sense of closure. The bereaved wife, Marie (played perfectly by the gorgeous Ms. Rampling) seems to be doing alright on the surface except for a few comments at a get together which make the viewers feel that she is having a hard time talking about her husband in past tense. We are a bit alarmed but that&apos;s the extent of it. However, when she returns to her home, we realize the utter & extreme denial that fills every aspect of her life! It is horrifying & saddening. That a beautiful, intelligent woman can have such a reaction is a clear reminder to us of humanity&apos;s fragility & vulnerability when it comes to love. Losing a loved one is never easy. However, since humans are rational beings, it becomes much harder to come to terms with such a great loss in the absence of any plausible reason. So, not knowing exactly what happened to her husband was perhaps the biggest source of grief for Marie.

This is a very sincere look into the mind of a woman who seems to have lost a part of herself with the loss of her spouse. But I struggled with understanding the two men in Marie&apos;s life. Her husband&apos;s intentions were never fully revealed & I&apos;m kind of okay with that because that&apos;s the point of the story. However, the one that I really have a problem with is Vincent. Why this charming & intelligent man got involved with Marie when she was not in a good place mentally is beyond me!

This movie has brought an epiphany to me. We must always consider the possibility that even though we may be perfectly happy & content with someone, things may not be so good for them. And when we love that someone, it may become extremely hard for us to let go or even to understand how they could be unhappy in such a fulfilling relationship. But such is human nature. Sometimes, having been in long relationships, people evolve in different directions such that one partner may be very happy with the routine stuff while the other may be getting suffocated. One man&apos;s medicine is another man&apos;s poison, after all! And so, it may happen that one fine day, our loved one may want to walk out on us & while it may hurt us, it might be their only salvation! We also need to consider the fact that some people may just be depressed & at that point, it is pretty much out of our hands. All we can do in such circumstances is to be supportive & hope for the best.

Lastly, this is one of those movies where you cannot have a spoiler in a review because the ending scene is open to everyone&apos;s personal interpretation & for that, you need to see it yourself!",8,"['Drama', 'Mystery']","['female frontal nudity', 'sex', 'male frontal nudity', 'female nudity', 'female masturbation']",2001-05-04,['François Ozon'],"['Charlotte Rampling', 'Bruno Cremer', 'Jacques Nolot']","['François Ozon', 'Emmanuèle Bernheim', 'Marina de Van']"

Unforgiven,,"Unforgiven is about as far from the fantasy mythos of A Fistful of Dollars as Clint Eastwood could get. No pin-point accuracy with 19th century technology, no desire to &apos;play fair&apos; and face the enemy on even terms. If you can shoot him in the back...then do it.

Eastwood puts in an astonishing performance as the retired killer Muny, saved from his life of thievery and murder by his late wife. Now, desperately trying to support his children with no income, he is tempted back to his killing ways by the bounty offered by the women of a brothel, one of whom&apos;s number has been savagely beaten and disfigured by a drunken ranch-hand.

The film follows Eastwood as he wrestles with his desire to honour his wife&apos;s memory and his need to feed his children by returning to the killer that, he fears, is his true nature. Meanwhile word of the bounty has spread and the events spiral out of control as the sheriff (Gene Hackman) deals with the guns for hire that ride into town.

While all the supporting cast are excellent Gene Hackman&apos;s Oscar winning performance even manages to eclipse Eastwoods as the brutal Sheriff. He beats one of the bounty hunters, English Bob (Richard Harris) almost to death and then explains to a journalist, in one of the film&apos;s stand out scenes, how men like he and Muny are so successful at killing. The mood moves from light banter to life threatening seriousness...and back again, with just one move of his head.

One of the greatest Westerns ever made? Certainly. Although the fact it&apos;s a western is really secondary. In truth it&apos;s a tale of the nature of evil and the nature of man. Eastwood uses the gap between the western myth and reality as an arena to play out his story and does so with consummate style.",9,"['Drama', 'Western']","['revenge', 'revisionist western', 'one last job', 'sadist', 'gun control']",1992-08-07,['Clint Eastwood'],"['Clint Eastwood', 'Gene Hackman', 'Morgan Freeman']",['David Webb Peoples']

The Unholy Rollers,"Behind-the-scenes like of the Roller Derby circuit... A beautiful young woman joins a Roller Derby team, but her fierce independence and competitive spirit get her into trouble.","This was an attempt by American-International Pictures to cash in on the publicity for the highly publicized KANSAS CITY BOMBER, also released in 1972. Actually, it&apos;s more like Roger Corman&apos;s attempt to do so, because while A.I.P. footed the bill, it was a Corman show all the way (even though he had already started his own movie company/distribution outfit, New World Pictures, two years earlier.) In fact, it has the same look and sparse production values as New World movies of the earlier &apos;70s, making you wonder if A.I.P. gave Corman little to spend, or if Corman pocketed a lot of the budget.

Whatever the case, the end result is pretty boring to sit though, despite the showcased sport (roller derby) and the presence of B movie queen Claudia Jennings. The first few minutes aren&apos;t bad, promising an energetic and wacky look at the behind-the-scenes of roller derby, but then the movie suddenly takes a turn to the deadly serious. Sure, there are catfights, nudity, and clobberings on the roller ring, but there&apos;s no feeling of fun to it all. Actually, much of the movie focuses on boring bickering and chattering between the characters. To make matters worse, the print of the movie currently playing on cable eliminates the original music score and substitutes bland muzak that results in the viewing experience becoming more of a slog to get through.",,"['Action', 'Comedy', 'Drama']","['1970s', 'exploitation', 'cult', 'broad as slang for woman', 'record player']",1972-11-10,['Vernon Zimmerman'],"['Claudia Jennings', 'Louis Quinn', 'Betty Anne Rees']","['Howard R.

The Unholy Three,,"Though not nearly as polished as its silent counterpart, in large part due to the absence of director Tod Browning, this version is still a well-made film with a lot to offer. If for no other reason than seeing Lon Chaney in his only sound film, this film is a must! Chaney is wonderful again in the role of Echo, a ventriliquist and criminal. Chaney shows that he understood the sound medium and would have done great things in pictures to come had he lived. Alas! he died shortly after this film from throat cancer. He shows that he was a very credible actor and really impressed me with his comic timing. The rest of the cast is good with Elliot Nugent as the patsy Hector contributing a nice turn and Harry Earles again reprising his role as the midget baby. I found some of his words a bit difficult to understand, but he nonetheless added immeasurably with his split persona of a hard, stogie-chomping small man and then becoming a little tyke with relative ease. Lila Lee does a credible at best job as Rosie O&apos; Grady. Some scenes in this film are particularly well-crafted as when the policeman visits the home of Mrs. O&apos;Grady and starts playing with Earles&apos;s toy elephant. Also, Earles is a delight to watch playing with a ruby necklace. Chaney does not get the opportunity to show the pathos he exuded in the silent version - more due to Browning&apos;s absence I think. Director Jack Conway does a workmanlike job but misses a bit with the atmosphere of the film. At any rate a fine film and a tribute to Chaney as man capable of just about anything!",,"['Crime', 'Drama', 'Romance']","['christmas', 'hand over mouth', 'tattooed woman', 'evil lead character', 'timeframe 1920s']",1930-07-12,['Jack Conway'],"['Lon Chaney', 'Lila Lee', 'Elliott Nugent']",['Clarence Aaron &apos;Tod&apos; Robbins']

Tuntematon sotilas,"A film adaptation of Väinö Linna&apos;s best selling novel The Unknown Soldier (1954) and the novel&apos;s unedited manuscript version, Sotaromaani.","I enoyed this film very much, i saw it in the theatres here in Sweden. This kind of movie was very new to me since im not used to this kind of realistic film. There was raw emotions and alot of sadness in it, picturing the war as close as it was. This movie has no gloryfication, it showed loss on both side and the horrible sides of war. I very much enjoyed the fact that the war scenes had alot of realistic deaths in it. Not just explosion everywhere but the camera showing us the soldiers&apos; fear and their deaths and letting us see that. We usually do not see this vournable side. Walking over your fellow sodier&apos;s body that just got shot in the head and the camera is not looking away . This movie was grim, with a lot of feelings, pain, But it felt intelligent somehow. It felt like a real movie. 

Just to make it clear, the movie in swedish theatres was cut shorter so there are some scenes I haven&apos;t seen yet. The movie we saw was just over 2 hours while it is actually 3 hours long but theatres here thought it would be way too long and not attract enough audience.",8,"['Drama', 'War']","['finland', 'world war two', 'based on novel', 'finnish soldier', 'lotta svard']",2018-12-06,['Aku Louhimies'],"['Eero Aho', 'Johannes Holopainen', 'Jussi Vatanen']","['Väinö Linna', 'Aku Louhimies', 'Jari Olavi Rantala']"

The Untouchables,"During the era of Prohibition in the United States, Federal Agent Eliot Ness sets out to stop ruthless Chicago gangster Al Capone and, because of rampant corruption, assembles a small, hand-picked team to help him.","This splendid film is set during Prohibition era Chicago in the 30s . Elliot Ness (Kevin Costner) gets the government&apos;s go-ahead to form his own particular group of relentless , honest Federal Agents (Sean Connery , Charles Martin Smith , Andy Garcia) to combat Al Capone (Robert De Niro) and his hoodlums, specially Frank Nitti (Billy Drago) .

No one could stop him. - Until Eliot Ness and a small force of men swore they&apos;d bring him down. What are you prepared to do? .Never stop fighting till the fight is done

This is a violence-ridden story full of action , drama , thriller and being pretty entertaining . Intelligent and suspenseful script by David Mamet (Pulitzer winning playwright) . Spectacular shootém up on the station steps remains with echoes of &apos;The battleship Potemkin&apos; (Sergei Einstein,1925) . Kevin Costner is excellent as impulsive and obstinate enforcer fighting against the underworld crime . Sean Connery (Academy-award winning acting) plays in perfection a veteran , incorruptible police who takes under his experience and protection to Ness . And Robert De Niro overacting in a serious-comical role as the nasty Capone . Flamboyant and rich photography by cameraman Stephen H. Burum. Sensitive and emotive musical score by the great master Ennio Morricone . The motion picture was beautifully directed by Brian De Palma . This superb recounting will appeal immensely to Kevin Costner and Sean Connery fans.

Used Cars,"When the owner of a struggling used car lot is killed, it&apos;s up to the lot&apos;s hot-shot salesman to save the property from falling into the hands of the owner&apos;s ruthless brother and used-car rival.","first of all when this movie came out, in 1980, (when first i saw it) was way before cell phones, personal computers, and the saturation of mtv, which all have jaded our youth of today. this was a comedy years ahead of it&apos;s time..that said. kurt russell&apos;s character assassination of a used car salesman is a direct hit. gerrit graham&apos;s performance is extremely brilliant as a superstitious-gambling fanatic, really the whole cast is incredibly funny. but it&apos;s the dual performance of jack warden playing twin bothers, with good and evil inclinations, that probably should of won him a golden globe (on that performance alone) he&apos;s that good...simply put, this movie is laughs,laughs, split your pants laughs, and more laughs. a must watch comedy. and after you&apos;ve seen it you&apos;ll want to add it to your movie library. but if you somehow don&apos;t find this movie funny, then maybe you need to check your sense of humor at the door...",,['Comedy'],"['car dealership', 'public nudity', 'used cars', 'used car lot', 'used car salesman']",1980-07-11,['Robert Zemeckis'],"['Kurt Russell', 'Jack Warden', 'Gerrit Graham']","['Robert Zemeckis', 'Bob Gale']"
The Usual Suspects,"A sole survivor tells of the twisty events leading up to a horrific gun battle on a boat, which began when five criminals met at a seemingly random police lineup.","I couldn&apos;t help but set rather high expectations for &apos;The Usual Suspects&apos; as I went into watching this. I knew this was no action movie or any of the crap we get nowadays. This was true cinema! I was excited &apos;The Usual Suspects&apos; is a mystery film about what cargo was on board the ship when it was destroyed and the events leading up to it as we are told from the only known survivor of that accident.

Around 45-50 minutes into the movie, I was starting to find myself a bit tired and thought the movie may perhaps have dragged along just a bit. I was becoming rather disappointed. Then the film truly began to change in such a way that I find it rather hard to explain. The characters began to get a little more entertaining, the pacing certainly began to pick up, the dialogue was getting more interesting and overall, I was more excited.

Then comes the amazing final twenty minutes with the plot twist and the story finally closing in perfectly, making the story more understandable. However, the final 5 minutes of the movie are some of the best moments of movie ever made and that is the ultimate plot twist which surprised the hell out of me! It was a cheering end to what ended as a great movie and a movie I would be more than happy to check out again and again!

Vacancy,"A married couple becomes stranded at an isolated motel and finds hidden video cameras in their room. They soon realize that unless they escape, they&apos;ll be the next victims of a snuff film.","Grieving over the loss of their son, David and Amy Fox are driving thru the night heading towards their destination...the signing of the divorce papers!. David unwisely leaves the interstate looking for a short cut and swerves to avoid hitting a raccoon, this causes engine trouble and eventually they have to settle for staying at a grotty roadside motel until the car can be fixed in the morning. Upon attempting to relax in their dirty and poorly decorated room, they are disturbed by loud banging on the doors to their room, this is merely the start of a night of terror as the Fox&apos;s will be forced to fight to stay alive in the confines of this Horror Motel!

Seen it before? Yes we all most certainly have, from proto slashers to Euro terrors, the couple under siege formula is as old as the hills themselves. But Vacancy has such a sense of fun and a unique use of its plot setting, that even a terribly formulaic cop out towards the end is mostly forgiven. The setting is one dirty hole of a motel, but the dirt is not merely confined to the structure and basic house keeping of the place, the worst dirt comes in a terrifying form that is fully formed from the moment we meet the creepy motel manager (a wonderfully cheesy Frank Whaley). From here our intrepid couple, very well played by Luke Wilson & Kate Beckinsale, must use the most basic resources to hand, to hopefully escape the clutches of masked assailants intent on gutting them in the name of entertainment.

What follows is the usual jumps and perilous set ups, and a quirky line in labyrinth adventure. But then that ending that almost derails the whole picture, it does hurt it because we the viewers can only feel let down that the makers chose to not stay with what would have been an impacting turn of events. But for a film that&apos;s homaging films (and thriller maestros) from the past and clearly doing what it set out to do, it&apos;s to me a forgivable error. It&apos;s not taking itself too seriously, and you shouldn&apos;t too, just check in with the Fox&apos;s and get involved with the thrills. 6.5/10",7,"['Horror', 'Thriller']","['murder', 'motel', 'trapped', 'slasher', 'remote place']",2007-04-20,['Nimród Antal'],"['Kate Beckinsale', 'Luke Wilson', 'Frank Whaley']",['Mark L.

The Valley of Gwangi,"A cowboy named Tuck Kirby seeks fame and fortune by capturing an Allosaurus living in a Mexican valley and putting it in a wild west show. His star attraction, called the Gwangi, turns out to have an aversion to being shown in pub...","Shot in Technicolor by Erwin Hillier and in Dynamation, The Valley Of Gwangi sees Tuck Kirby (James Franciscus) and a team of cowboys get more than they bargained for when they enter a hidden valley in Mexico. For here, prehistoric creatures reside and the cowboys come up with the idea of capturing a Tyrannosaurus Rex to become the chief attraction in the circus they work at.

The makers of Gwangi never hid their motivations or homages, from the off they wanted to nod towards King Kong whilst pairing the Western and Fantasy genres in the process. The result of which is an enjoyable if unfulfilled movie that again sees Ray Harryhausen&apos;s stop-motion creations save the day. Directed by Jim O&apos;Connolly with a screenplay by William Bast, The Valley Of Gwangi suffers not because of its bonkers plot (this is after all why we watch this type of genre offering), but more because of the slow first half that threatens to put the viewer into torpor. Thankfully the film is saved by the afore mentioned Harryhausen who unleashes prehistoric joys on the B movie cast (tho Laurence Naismith is considerably better than the material given him). While the ending raises the adrenaline sufficiently enough to have made the wait worth while. Jerome Moross lifts from his brilliant score for The Big Country with mixed results; it just feels out of place here, even if it&apos;s stirring and pleasing to the ears. And the Almería, Andalucía location work in Spain is at one with the material to hand.

This movie is directed by Robert Young (Hostage) and stars Thorley Walters (Adventure of Sherlock Holmes), Adrienne Corri (A Clockwork Orange), Anthony Higgins (Indiana Jones) and Richard Owens (Sense and Sensibility).

The kills in this are pretty bad, especially when the animals do the killing. The cast is solid and the actors do a great job, especially the clown.

Overall this is an uneven movie that is an above average addition to the horror genre that is worth watching once for horror enthusiasts.

The Vampire Lovers,Seductive vampire Carmilla Karnstein and her family target the beautiful and the rich in a remote area of late eighteenth-century Gemany.,"Where would the horror field be if it weren&apos;t for the legendary Hammer Studios? With their constant creativity and new variations on the general topic of vampirism they delivered some of the most important genre-films ever. Roy Ward Baker&apos;s film the Vampire Lovers is one of the most essential movies Hammer ever released and it meant a landmark turning point for the sub-genre of bloodsuckers. Due to THIS film, vampirism afterwards always got immediately associated with eroticism and lust. The Vampire Lovers influenced notorious directors like Jess Franco (Vampyros Lesbos, Les Avaleuses) or Jean Rollin (Lips of Blood, The Living Dead Girl) who practically made an entire career out of lesbian vampire movies. But this is the real thing! A stunning screenplay, based on a classic tale by Sheridan Le Fanu, solid acting performances and an atmospheric  almost dreamlike  photography. Ingrid Pitt plays the best, most memorable role of her career as the gypsy vampire Carmilla. Her sensual character seduces attractive young girls at the homes of prominent men where she&apos;s at guest and turns them into weak, lifeless slaves. The worried men have to uncover the origin of this vampire wench in order to destroy her forever.

&apos;The Vampire Lovers&apos; offers a nearly perfect combination of atmosphere, beauty and tension. Mostly thanks to the female cast led by Ingrid Pitt, this is the most bewitching horror tale Hammer ever told. The ravishing naked bodies of Pitt, Madeline Smith (Theathre of Blood) and Kate O&apos;Mara (Horror of Frankenstein) will give this film a spot in your memory forevermore. And that&apos;s not a sexist remark; it just needs to be said. Other than the charismatic female appearances, this production also depends a lot on the eerie set pieces and the nightmarishly dark images of graveyards, ruins and castles. Overall, a splendid horror film and a must see for all fans of Hammer, vampirism or gorgeous beauties.",7,['Horror'],"['bathtub', 'female full frontal nudity', 'female pubic hair', 'female rear nudity', 'towel']",1970-11-23,['Roy Ward Baker'],"['Ingrid Pitt', 'Pippa Steel', 'Madeline Smith']","['Sheridan Le Fanu', 'Harry Fine', 'Tudor Gates']"

Vampyres,Two mysterious women lure various passers-by to their rural mansion in the English countryside and hold them captive in order to feed on them to satisfy their insatiable thirst for blood.,"Vampyres is a truly atypical genre film. The girls have no fangs, their victims do not become vampires, and theirs is not so much an aversion to sunlight as a dislike. It eschews traditional bloodsucker conventions in favor of atmosphere and eroticism, and the result, though English in origin, seems more like one of the Continental horror films being made at the same time--probably thanks to Spanish director Jose Larraz.

Marianne Morris and Anulka are gorgeous and sadly sympathetic as the two undead lovers. Though slowly paced, there is an ample amount of suspense and a great deal of gore, as the beautiful ladies lick the spurting blood from the open wounds of their victims. The film also contains some of the most incredibly erotic sex scenes in any horror film (please see the uncut X-rated version). Add a Gothic mansion, plenty of lush autumnal scenery, and poetic shots of the vamps running through a graveyard at dawn, and you get a thoroughly beautiful motion picture that you won&apos;t soon forget.",,['Horror'],"['erotica', 'vampire', 'lesbian vampire', 'sadism', 'female full frontal nudity']",,['José Ramón Larraz'],"['Marianne Morris', 'Anulka Dziubinska', 'Murray Brown']","['Diana Daubeney', 'José Ramón Larraz', 'Thomas Owen']"
Vampyros Lesbos,An erotic horror tale about a vixen vampiress seducing and killing women to appease her insatiable thirst for female blood.,"This has got to be one of the most surreal films ever made. The film brilliantly combines weird art-house imagery with sexadelic soft-core to create a genuinly original film, full of strange gothic colours and futuristic, freefall visuals.

The Vatican Tapes,A priest and two Vatican exorcists must do battle with an ancient satanic force to save the soul of a young woman.,"One would expect a rich cultural or more in-depth take of possession premise with a title such as The Vatican Tapes. Unfortunately, it&apos;s nothing more than mediocre horror with barely anything new. Not to mention it&apos;s trapped between forced found footage style for some parts and shaky cam for the rest.

It&apos;s the story as old as the supposed entity possessing the poor victim, in this case Angela (Olivia Taylor Dudley). She begins showing weird behavior and it eventually attracts the attention of Vatican. For acting department, there are actually some decent names here such as Michael Peña, Djimon Hounsou or Dougray Scott. They all have worked in bigger movies or played different roles, and there&apos;s a visible effort here, but the material is so thin their characters feel lackluster.

Pacing is also another issue. The way it&apos;s presented might make the timeline seem odd, it switches back and forth between early stages of haunting and eventual discovery. However, the transition is poor and it doesn&apos;t escalate well, although that&apos;s partially because of the timid horror. Visually, it&apos;s very confusing, often using documentary style such as following character with camcorder perspective or CCTV videos, all of which are unnecessary and only manage to limit the presentation.

As for the creepy parts, they are practically the stuffs of old. If you have seen any similar movie in past couple of years, chances are you&apos;ve seen this before. A few scenes fare better, although these are also heavily borrowed from other films. There&apos;s barely any grand sight or atmosphere of Vatican, in fact the priests from holy city almost like supporting character that pop up in small portion of the movie.

It&apos;s all right if the concept is not novel, many other movies have done old concept well. However, The Vatican Tapes relies too heavily on superficial gimmicks and sadly low on thrill.",4,"['Horror', 'Thriller']","['demonic possession', 'exorcist', 'antichrist', 'vatican', 'priest']",2015-07-22,['Mark Neveldine'],"['Olivia Taylor Dudley', 'Michael Peña', 'Dougray Scott']","['Christopher Borrelli', 'Michael C.

The Velvet Vampire,"Lee and his wife Susan accept the invitation of mysterious Diane to visit her secluded desert estate. Tensions arise when the couple, unaware that Diane is a vampire, realize that they are both objects of the pale temptress&apos;s sedu...","Invited out to a strange mansion, a married couple arrive at a strange woman&apos;s home in the desert where she shows them around the area, but when she suspects something is wrong with the host they eventually come to believe she&apos;s a vampire and tries to get away alive.

Overall, this was a decent enough if flawed genre effort. What gives this the most to like here is the nearly ethereal approach to the main vampire this takes. The whole ruse about getting them out to the desert mansion and then baiting them against each other with her secret lustful looks, spying on the couple in bed from her hidden chamber behind the mirror, the straight seduction scenes on the husband, or the visions shot through the slow-motion style which is all incredibly enjoyable. This here makes the trip feel more suspenseful the longer they stay knowing what the end game here eventually leads to. That becomes quite fun as the film goes along as the gradual realization of what&apos;s happening is brought out. While the looks and remarks she gives hint at the seduction, the oblivious nature of her vampiric tendencies offers a lot of great scenes featuring her attacking and killing others to feed on their blood. This even makes the finale quite fun as the seduction tactics are revealed for some unexpected targets signaling some shocking revelations that take place, and when combined with the closing epitaph and nicely done sleaze in the seduction scenes has a lot to like about it. There are some issues with this one. One of the biggest factors here is the lagging storyline that tends to switch into numerous plot points whenever it&apos;s convenient to do so. The couple goes from hating each other to loving depending on the nature of the scene, the ruse to keep them there is wildly inconsistent and plots are dropped at random intervals merely because it sees fit to do so, almost as if it were all made up on the spot. This also explains the inconsistent vampire lore, being out in the daylight, and other factors that ignored tropes for no reason which all brings this one down.

It is one of the most best of his films. The action is stronger than many previous films, the music is good and the locations such as France and San Francisco.

Vigilante,"After his wife and son got brutalized by a street gang, and a corrupt criminal justice system puts the perpetrators back on the street, a NYC factory worker teams up with a vigilante group to find some measure of bloody justice.","Director William Lustig&apos;s stirring low-cost vigilante picture is something a little more than your exploitative gung-ho revenge story, as while the material is lank and far-fetched its still implodes with some minor goods. Honestly the first time I came across it, I was left under whelmed and this can be attributed to the direction it went. The story has two sub-plots running, which would eventually come together, but the focus on one over the other really destroyed what could have a lasting impression. On one side of the coin has a small group of local vigilante&apos;s led by Nick (an inspired Fred Williamson) cleaning up punks that the law doesn&apos;t seem to want to touch and on the other side of the coin follows that of Eddie Marino (Robert Forster), a working class New Yorker coming home to find his wife has been brutally beaten and toddler killed. He&apos;s approached by Nick to join their cause, but refuses to let the justice system hand out the law, but after those who were responsible for the attack is left off with nothing but a slap on the wrists. It sees Eddie take it upon himself to hand out the punishment.

The constant shifts in the story seemed to get in the way of cooking any real sort of emotional hold. The cult actors do the best with what they got. Robert Forster&apos;s streamlined, if cold approach works and Fred Williamson&apos;s full-blooded bad-ass portrayal is nothing that&apos;s unexpected. Don Blakely and Willie Colon make for great, nasty pair of thugs. Also in the line-up are Richard Bright, Rutanya Alda, Joseph Carberry, Steve James and Carol Lynley. In brief, but welcoming inclusions are Woody Strode and Joe Spinell as a scummy lawyer.

The material is quite heavy-handed in what it&apos;s got to say on a flawed justice system, as Williamson spits out speeches about not living in fear and eventually the line between right and wrong is blurred. In the end don&apos;t read too much in to it. Lustig&apos;s pacing is on the spot and direction suitably controlled, as while not overly explicit it manages to have a brutal and gritty pulse. There are some intense interplays, and a disturbing moment or two, but in the end it&apos;s not particularly gripping like I would have hoped. It&apos;s quite underplayed in that department. Jay Chattaway&apos;s thumping score has a blaring sting and harrowing cloud that effectively balances the moods.",6,"['Action', 'Crime', 'Thriller']","['vigilante group', 'vigilante', 'vigilante justice', 'new york', 'nudity']",1983-03-04,['William Lustig'],"['Robert Forster', 'Fred Williamson', 'Richard Bright']",['Richard Vetere']
The Vikings,A slave and a Viking prince fight for the love of a captive princess.,"Unknown to both men, warrior Einar and disgraced slave Eric, are in fact half-brothers. As the kingdom of Northumbria becomes ripe for the taking, both men, with a fancy for Princess Morganna, are heading for the revelation right in amongst their bitter rivalry.

Kirk Douglas (Einar) and Tony Curtis (Eric) would both re-team for Spartacus two years after this sword and sandal swasher had hit the screens in 1958. That Spartacus is considerably a better film all told is a given, but The Vikings stands up well as an entertaining precursor to that Thracien slave classic. Based on the novel of the same name written by Edison Marshall, The Vikings makes up for what it lacks in authenticity with sheer gusto enhanced sword swishing adventure. These Vikings may not totally convince as mead swigging, women chasing, pillagers of England, yet running along side Mario Nascimbene&apos;s terrific score and Jack Cardiff&apos;s excellent photography (the Norway location scenes are breath taking), it doesn&apos;t take much for the discerning genre fan to get swept away in it all.

Douglas and Curtis give it a good blast, while Janet Leigh as Morganna perks her breasts out and actually becomes believable as a lady lusted after by two rough and ready ruffians. However, The Vikings doesn&apos;t sit up in the top echelons of swords and sandals pictures, something which irked both Douglas and director Richard Fleischer and caused them to hold each other responsible during the following years. With bad weather, injuries to actors and even a strike by Norwegian oarsmen to contend with, it was a far from easy shoot. Casting those issues aside, one tends to think that Douglas&apos; ire was warranted, for Fleischer was clearly the wrong choice for the piece. He chooses to go for a more genial, almost comic book approach, which sadly loses what earthy grit and grime feel the film needed once Orson Welles&apos; splendid opening narration had set things up for a bodice ripping sword slashing epic.

The director isn&apos;t found lacking with his action sequences though. With the likes of Fantastic Voyage, 20000 Leagues Under The Sea & 10 Rillington Place on his CV, he clearly was a director of worth. Here he impresses with his construction of the kinetic sword fights, while the attack on Nothumberland Castle (really it&apos;s Brittany, France, with Cardiff&apos;s camera working the oracle) is brilliantly staged and pumps the pulse rate considerably. Pic is often violent and features some genre moments never to be forgotten (Einar losing his eye, Ragnar and the Wolf Pit, The Running the Oars tradition), while it&apos;s also pleasing to find a director overseeing some attentive research that opens up the craftsman side of the Viking hoards.

So all in all it&apos;s a fine and entertaining genre picture that&apos;s arguably more fun than dramatic gold, a film that was a fave of many who got lost in its charms all those years ago. The flaws and minor frustrations are obvious when one revisits with older and wiser eyes, but regardless one should crack open the mead and enjoy the sheer grizzled guts of it all. 8/10",8,"['Action', 'Adventure', 'History']","['viking', 'swashbuckler', 'based on novel', 'woman in jeopardy', 'pirate']",1958-06-28,['Richard Fleischer'],"['Kirk Douglas', 'Tony Curtis', 'Ernest Borgnine']","['Calder Willingham', 'Dale Wasserman', 'Edison Marshall']"
Village of the Damned,A small town&apos;s women give birth to unfriendly alien children posing as humans.,"Acceptable Carpenter&apos;s remake with the premise is still interesting enough to watch it , dealing about several strangely emotionless children all born at the same time in a small village in Midwich . The scene is an American village of Midwich in which rare mist overcomes the idyllic coastal location . At the same moment, every single person and animal in town has passed out just as suddenly; some unknown force has put all the inhabitants of Midwich to sleep. Everybody falls into a deep, mysterious sleep for several hours in the middle of the day. When the army gets involved, they find this force has precise boundaries. A few hours later, this strange force disappears and everyone wakes up. The mystery remains unsolved for weeks, but it has a sequel. Some months later every woman (Linda Kozlowski , Meredith Salenger) capable of child-bearing is pregnant . All Midwich women of childbearing age are unaccountably pregnant. And the glowing-eyed children they have will prove to be worse than what they could have feared. The children that are born out of these pregnancies seem to grow very fast and they all have the same blond hair and strange, penetrating eyes that make people do things they don&apos;t want to do ; all of them have telephatic powers . They result to be mind-controlling demons or aliens . Meanwhile the doctor (good performance by Christopher Reeve) along with a scientist (Kirstie Alley in a new role who doesn&apos;t appear in the former film and doesn&apos;t do much sense) attempt to stop their plans of conquest .

This Sci-Fi thriller contains chills , suspense , intrigue and creepy events about some precocious deadly children and their quest of power . However, it suffers from unimaginative account because being a copy from original film (1960) by Wolf Rilla with more violent and explicit scenes and fails to provide the intelligent atmosphere from previous story . Furthermore , it packs better cinematography by Gary Kibbe who photographs colorful scenarios from the village .Suspenseful and thrilling musical score by the same director John Carpenter .

Other renditions based on John Wyndham novel titled ¨The Midwich cuckoos¨ and well adapted by Stirling Silliphant are the following : The black and white classic (1960) by Wolf Rilla with George Sanders , Michael G. Wynne and Barbara Shelley and followed by ¨Children of the damned (64)¨ by Anton Leader with Ian Hendry , Alan Badel and Barbara Ferris . Rating : Acceptable and passable , providing pleasant screams for the viewer . Essential and indispensable seeing for John Carpenter followers .",6,"['Horror', 'Sci-Fi', 'Thriller']","['alien', 'small town', 'alien life form', 'world domination', 'psychic power']",1995-04-28,['John Carpenter'],"['Christopher Reeve', 'Kirstie Alley', 'Linda Kozlowski']","['John Wyndham', 'Stirling Silliphant', 'Wolf Rilla']"

The Violent Years,"Paula Parkins is the teenage daughter of wealthy parents who can&apos;t seem to make time for her, so she looks for thrills as the leader of her all girl-gang who rob and rape young men.","Thoroughly entertaining for most of the time, this is the story of a bored, wealthy young woman who forms a gang with like-minded friends and has a whale of a time robbing gas stations, trashing schools and making men sexual offers they can&apos;t refuse. They are occasionally employed by Sheila, a splendid older gang moll in a tight sweater, whose appearance sadly only lasts a couple of minutes prior to her being gunned down. The plot runs from one absurdity to the next including two cop cars racing to a disturbance at a school and going in with all guns blazing, as if Bonnie and Clyde were in there. Unfortunately Mr Wood seemed to forget what the audience had paid to see, and devotes nearly a fifth of the running time to the patently phony moralizing required to justify everything else. This provides some fun in itself, with the veteran actor playing the judge clearly reading his interminable lines, while the distraught mother bemoans giving her errant daughter Paula &apos;a new dress instead of a caress&apos;. In fact Paula, played by the glamorous Jean Moorhead, looks ravishing in the one-piece she wears at the pajama party, no doubt from &apos;Victor Most of California&apos;, who gets a credit.

The Virgin Queen,Sir Walter Raleigh (Richard Todd) overcomes court intrigue to win favor with Queen Elizabeth I (Bette Davis) in order to get financing for a proposed voyage to the New World.,"The Virgin Queen marks Bette Davis&apos;s second go around as Elizabeth I of England. The first and better known film was done in 1939, The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex. The action in that film takes place at almost the very end of her regime in 1602. Bette Davis who was 31 at the time was made up to look the 66 that Elizabeth was then. 

This film takes place 15 years earlier, but Bette is now 47, a lot closer in age to the real Elizabeth then. The film is a fictional account of the arrival of Sir Walter Raleigh at her court and what transpired therein. 

Raleigh is played by Richard Todd, the Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex, Raleigh was played by Vincent Price. These are two quite different Raleighs, Todd is here, self described as blunt speaking plain soldier who wants Elizabeth to give him a ship to explore the new world. By 1602, Price&apos;s Raleigh has become every bit the flattering courtier that he as Todd so despised.

All royal courts are places of intrigue by their very nature, Elizabeth&apos;s even more so. First of all she was a woman who did like young handsome men around her. In her early days it was Robert Dudley, the Earl of Leicester played here by Herbert Marshall. Later on it was Christopher Hatton who is played by Robert Douglas. Then it was Raleigh and last the Earl of Essex, the protagonist in the earlier Davis Elizabethan role. These guys fought for her favor and she kind of enjoyed pitting them against each other. In addition she had the Cecils, uncle William and nephew Robert also serving here. There was no romantic attachment there and Francis Walsingham as well with no romance involved. Each one of these people had their good and bad qualities and served Elizabeth well in his own way.

Also she was known as The Virgin Queen because she was unmarried though I doubt strongly she physically kept her virginity. She was the last of the line of Tudors, the succession was very much up in the air. The threat of civil war, like the War of the Roses in the previous century. None of these guys knew who would wind up succeeding her, they all had to be on nimble feet to make the right jump. A wrong decision could cost somebody his head.

This is the background of what Raleigh was dealing with in Elizabeth&apos;s court. It&apos;s not true however that Christopher Hatton was the villain as shown here. He was battling for his survival like everybody else. 

What is true is that Raleigh while Elizabeth was drawn to him, was in turn drawn to Bess Throckmorton one of her ladies in waiting. He did secretly marry her and got her pregnant as the film states. And Elizabeth I got her dander up as she was wont to do.

I&apos;m sorry the Cecils and Walsingham were not included in this film. They were both very much on the scene, it&apos;s the biggest inaccuracy of the film.

It&apos;s not good history, but fair enough entertainment. Note the presence here of both a young Joan Collins as Ms. Throckmorton and Dan O&apos;Herlihy as Raleigh&apos;s Irish sidekick. Both do good jobs in their parts.",5,"['Biography', 'Drama', 'History']","['16th century', 'year 1581', 'knight', 'queen elizabeth i character', 'murder']",1955-07-22,['Henry Koster'],"['Bette Davis', 'Richard Todd', 'Joan Collins']","['Harry Brown', 'Mindret Lord']"
Virgin Witch,A pair of miniskirted birds who travel to a remote castle in order to land a contract in the modeling agency of the mysterious lesbian Sybil Waite (In HD).,"&apos;Allo &apos;allo, it&apos;s tasty British sitcom star Vicki Michelle revealing much more than she ever did on TV, accompanied by her almost as sexy and even more uninhibited sister Ann. The curvaceous pair star as Christine (Ann) and Betty (Vicki), beautiful siblings who are drawn into a coven of witches after Christine accepts a job with lesbian modelling agent/high priestess Sybil Waite (Patricia Haines).

Despite its witchcraft theme, Virgin Witch film is less about the supernatural and more about getting its lovely stars completely naked as often as possible; as such, the film is almost completely devoid of scares but packed with nudity and sex, with hardly a minute passing without one or both of the girls stripping off for a nude photo-shoot, bath, shower, or romp in the woods. Even when they&apos;re dressed, the girls wear the shortest mini-skirts possible!

The wild Wiccan rituals in which the sisters participate are the film&apos;s sleazy high-points (or is that &apos;low-points&apos;?), the girls being offered to the coven&apos;s lucky leader Gerald (Neil Hallett) for sex while his naked acolytes cavort around them in ecstasy, the scenes lit in garish primary colours, the camera swinging crazily to and fro. The frenetic finale is particularly bonkers, degenerating into a wild orgy of writhing bodies, precisely who is doing what to whom being virtually unfathomable.

Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea,"When the Earth is threatened by a burning Van Allen Radiation Belt, U.S. Navy Admiral Harriman Nelson plans to shoot a nuclear missile at the Belt, using his experimental atomic submarine, the Seaview.","I still remember seeing this film at movie theaters way back when I was a lad. Of course I didn&apos;t hear very much of it due to all the shrieks and squeals from the teenage girls in the audience over Frankie Avalon. That curiously enough didn&apos;t matter because Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea is a very visual film.

It might seem a little old hat today, but we&apos;ve been through two more generations that have seen the United States Navy become an atomic fleet of submarines and surface carriers. It was only seven years earlier, in 1955 that the U.S.S. Nautilus was launched as our first atomic submarine. In homage to that wonderful visionary Jules Verne who foresaw atomic power one hundred years earlier the Navy named it after that famous undersea ship of Verne&apos;s great novel 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. The nuclear submarine was a wondrous thing in 1961.

The idea of a nuclear power submarine was the brainchild of Admiral Hyman Rickover. Rickover was a tough minded s.o.b. who usually got whatever he wanted by any mean necessary including bullying. Hard to believe that the gentlemanly Walter Pigeon could play him, but he did and well as Admiral Harry Nelson, the ersatz Rickover. 

What&apos;s happened here is that the Van Allen radiation belt that surrounds the Earth has caught fire and temperatures are climbing all over the world. The planet is doomed, but Walter Pigeon&apos;s got an idea to save it. Fire a missile and seed the belt with more radiation, kind of a nuclear backfire and the blaze will end.

A lot of people are telling him it won&apos;t work, but Pigeon brushes them all aside. The only two who have faith in him are his assistants played by Peter Lorre and Barbara Eden. But our intrepid admiral pushes through. 

Of course the U.S.S. Seaview encounters all kinds of obstacles along the way, but that&apos;s the rest of the story.

The cast does very well for itself and young Frankie Avalon as a junior officer comes off rather nicely. Frankie sings over the title credits, but during the movie plays a trumpet. Avalon in fact was a trumpet virtuoso and a singing career was an afterthought. The fickle finger of fate.

Le salaire de la peur,"In a decrepit South American village, four men are hired to transport an urgent nitroglycerine shipment without the equipment that would make it safe.","In a remote South American town, four men are hired by an American oil company to transport two truckloads of nitroglycerin to an oil field, to put out a fire. It&apos;s a very hazardous task - the nitroglycerin can explode for the slightest reason, the road is treacherous and the journey is a long one. However, the money is very good and their current situation in the town is rather dire - they will do anything to improve their situation. 

Great thriller-drama by French director HG Clouzot. Starts slowly and even once the hazardous journey is in progress, it doesn&apos;t seem that brilliant. However, Clouzot builds the tension and from a point it is absolutely nail-biting stuff. The scene with the boulder has to be one of the most tense movie scenes I&apos;ve watched in my life. 

A good character-drama too - the way the characters develop and the relationships between the four change adds a new dimension to the drama and makes for very engaging viewing.

Not perfect though. Some events and plot devices don&apos;t make much sense, though aren&apos;t crucial to the movie. The ending felt quite silly and contrived.

Waking Sleeping Beauty,"The story of the Disney Renaissance, an incredibly prolific, successful and prestigious decade lasting from 1984 to 1994 that saw the fallen Walt Disney Animation Studios&apos; unexpected progressive triumphant return to excellence.","I&apos;m an avid fan of Disney and Disney history. I was elated to hear about this documentary and bought the DVD. Absolutely fascinating subject if you care anything for the history of Disney&apos;s place in the entertainment world. It was great to see all the archived footage from the 80s and 90s.

My only gripes with this doc is that there&apos;s SO much stuff to cover it can&apos;t possibly be done with the confines of a feature length. So to me it felt very rushed as they were pushing through subjects and materials really fast. You may think you&apos;ll get a lot of John Lasseter in this and Tim Burton but you don&apos;t. they only mention Nightmare Before Christmas and move on. A bit dissatisfying for me since I&apos;m fascinated in the outside people who were working for Disney at the time.

All in all a great Doc on a fascinating subject. But it felt rushed and leaves out quite a bit of stuff I felt should have been mentioned. Maybe one day Ken Burns will make a doc on the subject and I&apos;ll finally get my 10 DVD box set! Until then, it&apos;s great for the basics. Still a MUST SEE for Disney fans!!!

The Walk,"In 1974, high-wire artist Philippe Petit recruits a team of people to help him realize his dream: to walk the immense void between the World Trade Center towers.","From the first scene Joseph Gordon-Levitt dons the all black persona and talks about his passion, I&apos;m hooked. This monologue heavy delivery requires that caliber of performance from the lead, also reminds me of Ewan McGregor on Big Fish. It takes the audience on a bizarre yet fascinating adventure and makes us feel like a part of the character&apos;s larger-than-life endeavor.

This is the story of Philippe Petit, a performer with the idea of wire-walking across the World Trade Center towers. While it may sound simple, the journey there is a captivating one. The presentation is almost magical with circus act and flamboyant atmosphere, although there are plenty of realistic details and intricate planning involved, at times it almost feels like a funny heist movie.

Visual is breathtaking, the cinematography takes full advantages of the vistas, let it be small village or big city. The way the scenes are shot gives the movie a much more surreal ambiance. It&apos;s an enhanced realism, and although it&apos;s not as refined, there&apos;s a spirit of Hugo lingering here. It makes great use of 3D with timely panoramic shots and even stuff-thrown-at-your-face antic, but for this movie I wouldn&apos;t mind.

The same goes with its jazz influenced soundtracks, occasional slow ballad or alternate take on popular songs. The production value just oozes gorgeousness. All the technical aspects aside, the best attraction is definitely Joseph Gordon-Levitt. He is utterly remarkable, youthful and charming. This is the kind of acting prowess that can captivate audience with sheer passion, it&apos;s a true homage to the real life counterpart.

The Walk is nothing short of a breathtaking tale. Its charismatic protagonist and masterful visual invite the audience to not only walk alongside, but in a sense glide freely through such an inspiring story.",8,"['Adventure', 'Biography', 'Drama']","['tightrope walker', '1970s', 'world trade center manhattan new york city', 'skyscraper', 'based on true story']",2015-10-09,['Robert Zemeckis'],"['Joseph Gordon-Levitt', 'Charlotte Le Bon', 'Guillaume Baillargeon']","['Robert Zemeckis', 'Christopher Browne', 'Philippe Petit']"

Vals Im Bashir,An Israeli film director interviews fellow veterans of the 1982 invasion of Lebanon to reconstruct his own memories of his term of service in that conflict.,"Waltz with Bashir may not deliver everything you expect after seeing the trailers, but it is powerful. Director Ari Folman presents a personal view of historic events in which he took part as a young soldier, but which he cannot remember due to repression. A full-length documentary, filmed with animation over the recorded speech of actual participants in the 1982 Lebannon War, Waltz with Bashir is beautifully done and get its message across clearly.

It&apos;s a shame that some of the stronger artistic points in the movie were left undeveloped, such as the imaginary ghost of the soldier&apos;s ex-girlfriend following him around (as seen in the trailer). The way comedy and tragedy are interspersed in the latter parts of the film may also seem inappropriate to some viewers. The film presents a highly personal point of view for a documentary, justified partly by staying true to the factual material, and partly by its author having been there on the scene.

Overall, despite its shortcomings, this film makes a strong statement and is definitely worth seeing for its visuals and score.",9,"['Documentary', 'Animation', 'Biography']","['lebanon', 'israel defense forces', 'animated documentary', 'mass murder', 'israel lebanon war']",2008-06-12,['Ari Folman'],"['Ari Folman', 'Ron Ben-Yishai', 'Ronny Dayag']",['Ari Folman']

WarGames,"A young man finds a back door into a military central computer in which reality is confused with game-playing, possibly starting World War III.","It was with much interest to me to revisit this early 80s hacker piece armed with the knowledge of just how the advent of change in the computer world had evolved. With that in mind the film could quite easily be classed as a bit clunky due to the now almost Neanderthal toys, games and computers used in the movie, but casting aside the nostalgia feelings I had with it, it still hits the spot as both a poignant piece of interest, and a damn good thriller as well.

Matthew Broderick is David Lightman, a young computer gamer geek who is something of a whizz kid on the PC. He can change his school grades and hack into various sites he shouldn&apos;t be even looking at. During one eventful sitting he hacks into a computer called Joshua and plays a game called Global Thermonuclear War, he harmlessly chooses to be The Soviet Union and proceeds to launch a nuclear attack on his own country, the U.S.A. Trouble is, is that the game is for real and the wheels are in motion for World War III!.

It helps to remember the time this film was made (for those old enough of course), for it was the time of the ever worrying cloud of the Cold War, a time when nuclear war was more than a hearsay threat. I really think that in this day and age where computers literally do run our lives, this film stands up really well not only as a warning piece about messing with technology, but also as a gentle poke in the ribs about defence systems and the people we trust to run them. Though the film is a kind of watered down and accessible 2001: A Space Odyssey for the 80s set, it impacts well and only really suffers from a pointless romantic plot strand involving the sprightly Ally Sheedy (could they not just have been pals?) and the aforementioned dated gadgets. The ending to the film is excellent as the tension builds up nicely and we are left chewing our nails watching a game of Tic-Tac-Toe, sounds simple doesn&apos;t it? Not so.

You&apos;ll leave this movie much less certain than you were when you arrived.

The Warriors,A street gang known as The Warriors must fight their way from the Bronx to their home turf on Coney Island when they are falsely accused of assassinating a respected gang leader.,"I was working in a movie theater when The Warriors first came out, and remember well the flick and the hype surrounding it. Here&apos;s a few notes to clear up some misconceptions that many other commentors seem to have.

The flick was NOT ever intended to be an accurate portrayal of New York gang life, although there were some realistic elements. At the time it was generally accepted that it took place in the future, although nothing in the movie supports this. At best it can be considered an urban fable that takes place in a sort-of-imaginary world. You know, like Pulp Fiction (you think 90s LA gangsters dressed like that??).

Second, the film itself was not accused of inciting violence. Problem was, it was a VERY popular film with gang members, who would show up in force. Two rival gangs would show up at the same theater, and... you can figure the rest out yourself. One guy was killed on the first weekend the movie was playing in New York; after that, the distributor hired off-duty police for security at every theater across the country that showed the flick. In the small-town Midwest where I lived, this served more as advertising hype than anything else.

Finally, it was widely known back in the day that The Warriors was based on the ancient Greek nonfiction tale Anabasis, written around 370 BC by the Spartan general Xenophon (it&apos;s also published under the title The Persian Expedition). In this classic tale, a battalion of 10,000 Spartan mercenaries join the Persian emperor Cyrus for a war in Asia Minor (i.e. Turkey). Cyrus&apos;s army is defeated, the Spartan leaders are captured, and the remaining force must make their way across country, fighting various hostile tribes along the way, experiencing their own internal power struggles, until they reach the safety of the sea. I&apos;m shocked that only one reviewer seemed to be familiar with this; in the 70s almost nobody talked about the movie without mentioning it.

Great flick, by the way, and it holds up extremely well over time. I&apos;m sure the remake will suck.",,"['Action', 'Crime', 'Thriller']","['new york city', 'street gang', 'truce', 'survival', 'subway station']",1979-02-09,['Walter Hill'],"['Michael Beck', 'James Remar', 'Dorsey Wright']","['Sol Yurick', 'David Shaber', 'Walter Hill']"
The Wasp Woman,"The head of a major cosmetics company experiments on herself with a youth formula made from royal jelly extracted from wasps, but the formula&apos;s side effects have deadly consequences.","A professor is working on the deadly jelly of a Queen Wasp. Where he learns that this drug his working can slow down the aging cycle and make one look young again. So a boss of a cosmetics company in need to boost her companies falling sales becomes interested in it. So she becomes the first human guinea pig for the drug and soon enough she becomes a youthful beauty again. Though, there are nasty side effects to follow.

I will start off by typing that the DVD I watched it on didn&apos;t have such great picture quality, with some scenes being too dark and real grainy, but maybe that&apos;s the way it was shot. Since the production would have had a shoestring budget, but anyway it was still viewable.

Roger Corman&apos;s The Wasp Woman which I borrowed from a friend is one weird, but mostly a lacklustre thriller. It has a very slow first 50-miutes and it suddenly picks up in the last quarter of the film. I just found it quite a tedious viewing, with two or three moments of sheer excitement and interest in just basically the last 20-minutes of the film.

The film premise was interesting enough, but the discussions and theories leading up to the thrilling last quarter weren&apos;t entirely enticing or particularly fun viewing. They were more of a snore fest and a real drag. Well, maybe some scenes early on involving a Professor and his mumbo jumbo have its moments. But saying that, the story was generally unpredictable and it had its amusing situations. Like the fruity Prof. Zenthrop going into a trance and having a scuffle with a cat, the first appearance of the wasp woman and some moments when she decides to feed on some unexpected guests, but most of these humorous scenes come too late in the film.

The wasp costume came as a surprise; it looked ridiculously funny and truly unimaginative. With someone running around in black clothing, black high heels, a fury mask that covers the face with some feelers and beady eyes added on, but what do you expect from a Roger Corman z-grade film. Reading some reviews from fellow IMDb users I see I&apos;m not the only one to feel a bit conned, as the cover art on the DVD box actually had a wasp with a woman&apos;s head on it ;). Cheap and shoddy effects were to be expected and are definitely a humorous sight to see.

There are stilted performances, except for the main leads Susan Cabot as the vain boss of a beauty products company during the day and the vicious wasp woman at night and Michael Mark as Professor Eric Zinthrop are pretty good.

The script is fairly corny and at times it will unintentionally cause a snicker. The plot has its usual flaws and inconsistencies. Though, these are the reasons to watch these types of films.

The mostly loud and forceful music score was a bit over-the-top and it kind of got on my nerves. It was just too distracting for me. The dim lighting and cheap sets really added to the atmosphere side of things.

It has an enjoyable and thrilling climax, but the sudden ending just felt forced and unconvincing. I wasn&apos;t expecting big things or anything grand from this film, but I was hoping for more fun and for me the film sorely lacked that.

Well, maybe I&apos;m being too critical, but I just couldn&apos;t get into this film liked I hoped, as I usually enjoy these types of films. It&apos;s not awful, I just found it plain dreary well, most of it.",4,"['Horror', 'Sci-Fi']","['wasp', 'cult director', 'cult film', 'psychotronic film', 'mad scientist']",1959-10-30,['Roger Corman'],"['Susan Cabot', 'Anthony Eisley', 'Barboura Morris']","['Leo Gordon', 'Kinta Zertuche']"
Bølgen,"Although anticipated, no one is really ready when the mountain pass above the scenic, narrow Norwegian fjord Geiranger collapses and creates an 85-meter high violent tsunami.

The setting is scary : The alarm goes off by landslides center in Geirangerfjord. What the landslide geologists have feared is a fact and a gigantic tidal wave is heading for Geiranger.

The father takes matters in his own hands, when he suspects something is horrible wrong. They are all going in for heavy weather, with the waves devastating way.

The film is both exciting and entertaining. It is so much better than other films in the same genre like f.example Armageddon and Volcano.

What causes the viewer considerable disquiet is the murderer&apos;s own story as we learn about his abusive childhood, at the hands of his racist, violent father, and his mother who turned away.

The lead role of the protagonist is played by Leesham Alexander. I hadn&apos;t seen any of his work before, his performance was mesmerizing and compelling, drawing you in to the murderer&apos;s highly disorganised and damaged view of the world, acutely paranoid and withdrawn he finds himself within Feltham having spent previous time in other YOIs alone but sharing a cell with a young Asian man. The unfolding events are told through the murder&apos;s perspective as he struggles and stumbles toward the inevitable, horrific but avoidable end.

The victim, convincingly played by another relative unknown, is a young man with a future who appears to have a rehabilitated himself is due to be released.

This film is unsettling, but rightly so, if you enjoy a film which is thought provoking and challenging this is for you. I hope it does well for the writer, director and cast because the story remains highly relevant following the subsequent inquiry and the lessons not (yet) learned. 

Great direction from Antony Petrou and cinematography which captures the starkness of the institutions in which we place young people with little if any support.

This documentary really gets you hooked on Nollywood and straight after viewing this movie I was hopping mad that I didn&apos;t have a Izu Ojukwu or Tunde Kelani movie in hand to follow up on the subject.

Werewolf of London,"After botanist Wilfred Glendon travels to Tibet in search of a rare flower, the Mariphasa, he returns to a London haunted by murders that can only be the work of bloodthirsty werewolves.","WEREWOLF OF LONDON (1935) does not satisfy as a whole, but it does have some memorable spots. The basic plot tells of a introverted botanist (Henry Hull) who is stricken with the ability to become a werewolf. The film&apos;s great moments are peppered through out. There&apos;s the beautifully photographed scene in Tibet, where moonlight is almost sun-beach bright. There&apos;s the bit in the zoo with a cockney hag fooling around with the zookeeper. Hull&apos;s perfomance is superb. We feel his anger over his failed marriage to much younger Valarie Hobson, his fear over his new affiction. It&apos;s a shame the screenwriters didn&apos;t dwell on his marriage more. The film has a humdinger of an ending, especially with the werewolf&apos;s last line.",,"['Drama', 'Fantasy', 'Horror']","['full moon', 'flower', 'laboratory', 'dysfunctional marriage', 'jealousy']",1935-05-13,['Stuart Walker'],"['Henry Hull', 'Warner Oland', 'Valerie Hobson']","['John Colton', 'Robert Harris', 'Harvey Gates']"
Werewolves on Wheels,A biker gang and its leader fall prey to a satan worshipper and his cult.,"If you watch B movies long enough, you&apos;ll learn that movies with goofy titles usually aren&apos;t very good at all, and this one is no exception. It plays like they only had a rough outline connecting a few scripted scenes, because a lot of the time the movie forgets the story and has the bikers basically goofing around until something bad happens. A low budget and clumsy camera work just add to the aura of shabbiness.

I can&apos;t completely dismiss it, because there are a few small but good touches here and there. Some of the music isn&apos;t bad, and there are also a few visuals (a gigantic flock of birds, desert landscapes) that do pop out and grab your eye. And there are also a few surreal sequences that do show that the filmmakers were not completely without imagination. But such moments are very few, and don&apos;t even get this movie up to the rank of movies to watch with fast-forward.",,['Horror'],"['monks', 'nude dancing', 'biker', 'werewolf', 'motorcycle club']",1971-11-19,['Michel Levesque'],"['Steve Oliver', 'Donna Anders', 'Gene Shane']","['David M.

Werner Herzog Eats His Shoe,A short documentary in which directors Werner Herzog and Errol Morris make a bet which results in Herzog being forced to eat his own shoe.,"Those who know of Werner Herzog and his film work know he communicates with seriousness and intensity. Every sentence is a deliberate act of poetry. Herzog has no interest in wasting time saying anything that is not important.

In case it isn&apos;t obvious from the title, this movie is literally about Herzog eating his shoe after losing a bet. The levity and absurdity of this act is only amplified by the seriousness and intensity with which he approaches it. He must prepare the shoe as one would prepare a last meal, or prepare a body before burial.

If you haven&apos;t seen anything by Herzog before, don&apos;t bother just yet. If you have, I hope you laugh and cry as much as I did.",7,"['Documentary', 'Short']","['director name in title', 'five word title', 'shoe', 'bet', 'director']",,['Les Blank'],"['Werner Herzog', 'Tom Luddy', 'Michael Goodwin']",['Werner Herzog']

Non-sop action from beginning to end. Couldn&apos;t stop laughing. Almost closer to Corbucci&apos;s Spencer and Hill comedies than his gritty westerns. A very fun film indeed. Just as great as Companeros!

What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?,A former child star torments her paraplegic sister in their decaying Hollywood mansion.,"I don&apos;t think I walked into this one with the right set of expectations.

I wouldn&apos;t really say this is a straight horror movie like Psycho or The Birds, as it unfolds itself like a riveting drama of two sisters instead. The acting is phenomenal, though, at least from our two lead characters, and the way they play off each other is just fantastic. This one takes a while to get going, but once it does, you are in for a high-octane, creepy thrill ride.

Sorgenfri,A family of four is quarantined in their home as a virulent strand of the flu spreads into town and they are forced to the extreme to escape alive.,"What is wrong in 90% of zombie movies, what makes them SO bad usually? Running zombies, faster-than-eye-super-beast zombies, bad make up day zombies, CGI zombies. Here the crappy zombies simply are not the problem, though it has to be said, they&apos;re not that interesting either.

Sure, this one&apos;s got really nothing much to add to the sub-genre of zombie movies. But it manages to focus for a good deal on the characters and flesh them out discreetly far better than many other horror movies do. Enough to make them feel familiar, like people we all know.

Trying not to watch this as a zombie movie might actually help the movie. It focuses in the first half on the tension between the state and the small societies, families, and relationships. One could claim the focus is like from the opening of the Dawn of the Dead but with reversed roles - the main characters are not armed military here, they&apos;re unarmed naive civilians, and the military isn&apos;t any more sympathetic to them as it is towards the unknown viral threat. Also, like in the Dawn (...) the story line setting changes drastically after the first act, but... what could have been a commentary on how dangerous a thing a sudden power vacuum can be, the direction seem to stubbornly now... run towards the typical run of the mill modern zombie movie to please or embarrass the wide zombie sub-genre audiences. Depends completely on how you like your horror and how you watch movies. The latter half even comes with jump scares to add to the predictable remains of the plot. Which is a shame. There&apos;s also an afterwards added possibly optimistic ending that clearly contradicts an earlier scene and doesn&apos;t play well to the atmosphere.

The sound design is about as good as you can get, though there&apos;s no memorable OST. A zombie movie simply should not be released without a memorable OST, we owe that to Fabio Frizzi and Claudio SImonetti & Goblin.",6,"['Horror', 'Thriller']","['blood', 'bloody face', 'bitten in the throat', 'bitten in the neck', 'infected']",2016-05-13,['Bo Mikkelsen'],"['Benjamin Engell', 'Troels Lyby', 'Mille Dinesen']",['Bo Mikkelsen']

Omoide no Marnie,,"This Movie touches the human soul at many level. It depicts a child who has been abandoned, by her mother and then grandmother and later partly by her foster-mother, so she feels she can not depend on adults for security. It also shows the value of family and love and affection within the family. Unlike American movies where no one seems to have a family, where the only expression of love is trivial and sexual, here the emotions are deep and adult.

The movie elevates us to our higher beings, and that is why the experience is lasting, and enjoyable.

What I also liked about this movie is that the movie is pure and clean, and suitable for families again unlike American shows where there is always some agenda from some interest group. Here you are free to be yourself. below is in response to a perverted reviewer with mind in gutter who thought this move was misleading. Please do not associate yourself with this movie.

When the Wind Blows,A naive elderly British rural couple survive the initial onslaught of a nuclear war.,"I remember when this was released in the cinemas in 1986 in the UK. It had a fairly small release, yet attracted a lot of publicity. I didn&apos;t see it till it was on TV one Christmas - not the right time to show such a film. I was still only eleven or twelve and found it far more disturbing than any Nightmare On Elm Street, Poltergeist or American Werewolf that I&apos;d seen. The fact that the couple are so naive and innocent along with the sweet, old-fashioned comic-book style animation really manipulates the viewer so cleverly, that when the bomb hits and the true tone of the film reveals itself, the viewer is caught off guard just like the innocent couple are. You are plunged into the dark, deathly tone of the storyline and compelled to watch in the hope that this sweet couple will survive, whilst at the back of your mind, always knowing that they have little time left. It still has the same effect now on a third or fourth watching. It&apos;s so disturbing to see, yet something so compelling that you cannot turn away or turn off. As an historical piece of eighties cold war/anti-nuclear protest filmmaking, this is a timeless film that should be studied as part of history education when it comes to the 2080&apos;s and the world looks back a hundred years on a part of the 1980&apos;s that weren&apos;t so optimistic. This is a unique film that stands alone in terms of animation and stands out from all the typically optimistic, big and bright blockbusters of the eighties.",9,"['Animation', 'Drama', 'War']","['tragedy', 'adult animation', 'nuclear war', 'nuclear fallout', 'black comedy']",1988-03-11,['Jimmy T.

Wo die grünen Ameisen träumen,A geologist employed by an Australian mining company finds himself disputing the rights of some aborigines who believe their land to be sacred.,"I really liked this movie. I liked the respect that was offered and given by both the native demonstrators and the geologist. This film prompted thought, thought about what is valued when death approaches, whether that is seen as death of an individual or a people. The mining company stands on the foundation of its legal right to proceed with what the contemporary civilization values, and some scoff the values of the natives. But if we listen we hear that is something we all must address when asking of ourselves what is sacred and will we protect and defend that in the face of our own extinction, because clearly the law is not designed to protect the sacred, but to settle a dispute. We are an amalgam of the characters, the native voice that seeks self perpetuation of tribe and story, the company voice that works for progress and acquisition of wealth, the mediator and thinker voice that comes through the geologist, and the law which strives of order in chaos. These tensions of the human condition, are made so vivid in the land and skies of the Australian outback.",,['Drama'],"['australian aborigine', 'trial', 'legality', 'ant', 'nature']",1985-02-08,['Werner Herzog'],"['Bruce Spence', 'Wandjuk Marika', 'Roy Marika']","['Werner Herzog', 'Bob Ellis']"

The White Buffalo,"At the closing of 1874 a haunted, dying Wild Bill Hickok teams up with a grieving Crazy Horse to hunt a murderous albino buffalo.","I know a lot of people are not too impressed with this film. However when i first saw this about 14 years ago the images and atmosphere and chilly locations made an impact on my mind. I have seen this film several times and agree it is not one of Charles Bronson&apos;s best efforts but I still love watching this film regularly. The hunt for the white buffalo in the Black Hills is presented as a psychological battle in the mind of Wild Bill Hickok (Bronson) and a spiritual one for Chief Crazy Horse (Will Sampson). Sure the creature itself may look unrealistic,but the concept of battling your nightmares and the teaming up of two racial enemies as well as the dark cold almost sinister locations make this an interesting experience in my view. I also feel the dialogue is extremely appropriate with the use of &apos;Gold Diggers slang&apos;.

White Pongo,"Hunters and scientists venture into the jungle to track down a savage albino gorilla, which they believe could be the missing link between man and ape.","White Pongo isn&apos;t a bad movie. The problem is, it isn&apos;t a good one either. The acting is adequate but the story moves very slowly. The slight twists and turns of the movie are not enough to bring some much needed excitement to the production. I thought that the costume for the white ape was actually pretty good but the ape wasn&apos;t used to the full extent that it was capable of playing. I would have to say that White Pongo is a not so exciting adventure movie, partly a romantic story and a very small part mystery movie. My review would have to be that it is not good, not bad but a so so movie. If you do watch the movie, don&apos;t expect too much and you won&apos;t be disappointed.

White Zombie,"A young man turns to a witch doctor to lure the woman he loves away from her fiancé, but instead turns her into a zombie slave.","I&apos;m not entirely sure why this film is considered a horror classic. But having seen many other horror films from the 1930s, I would have to agree it&apos;s definitely one of the better ones.

The plot: a Frenchman in Haiti makes a deal with Bela Lugosi to turn a beautiful young woman (Madge Bellamy, the finest 1930s woman by far) into a zombie. But then he becomes disillusioned and Bela Lugosi strikes back at the Frenchman. Oh ,and there are other zombies, an absent-minded professor and a really annoying screeching vulture.

This film has some of the strangest transitions between scenes. I forget the word for when the screen slides over, but it does it a number of times in short succession in some strange shapes (like curtains, or diagonally). And there is a weird fascination with showing Bela Lugosi&apos; eyes and his hand gestures repeatedly. The eyes reveal what seems to me some of the fakest eyebrows ever glued to a forehead.

But if you like Lugosi or classic horror, or Madge Bellamy... yeah, you should see this film.

Of course it is laced with a wry, bleak humour, and much of the blood spurting has a balletic, often fun energy. But energy is the key word here, the direction, the cinematography, the unusual movement of the camera that replaces where lazier directors would cut, the infectious soundtrack, the script that unravels it&apos;s mysteries precisely, I found the film to have very unique and energetic style. Thrilling, gory yes, but grounded with excellent performances and a biting script that deconstructs corruption in Russian society; how that eats away at institutions, friends and family.

The plot of this movie is not too much imaginative (working kids of a mining complex in the 1900&apos;s are killed in an explosion and seeks revenge against the descendants of the mine&apos;s owner. A windows with her two girls goes to the house near the mine and you know the rest of it).

Dialogues are weak, actors are so so, no fx at all, poor characterization and just a little tension all along the movie, none really scary moment and a dull ending.

The Wicker Man,"A puritan Police Sergeant arrives in a Scottish island village in search of a missing girl, who the Pagan locals claim never existed.","The bizarre and chilling tale of a fool chosen to be king for a day.

The shocking denouement of this film has stayed with me for many years, far longer than scenes or images from more famous films. A classic of its kind, it deserves the re-release it will probably never get.

Superficially a mystery thriller, this intelligent and well researched story delves into the beliefs and rituals of Ancient Britain, its folk mythologies and music, and reveals some of the un-settling fears that lie at their root. Set on a remote Scottish Island and giving the appearance of being a Whisky Galore, Local Hero type community, there is yet something off-centre about the townspeople that Edward Woodward, as Sergeant Howie, has come to investigate. The presence of Christopher Lee as the eloquent, commanding Lord of the Isle, gives the film an insidiously creepy edge suggesting a Hammer Horror lurks around the next wee wall. He is perfect in the role.

The story un-folds like a cross between Chinatown and Rosemary&apos;s Baby, as the dogged Howie gets led all over town, up one blind alley and down another. Clues are dropped all the way about what is really going on, but we don&apos;t heed them. Until it&apos;s too late. Too late to walk away.

The standard video version runs for 85 minutes, cuts many important scenes and shows others out of sequence. A BBC version shown in 1998 ran around 95 minutes. The full version ran 102 minutes but I have never found it.

However, whilst uneven in parts and certainly flawed this is one of the most intelligent and interesting stories I have ever seen on film. See it yourself and you too will have many meetings with &apos;The Wicker Man&apos;, in your dreams, in the dark, where you cannot escape.",7,"['Horror', 'Mystery', 'Thriller']","['folk horror', 'paganism', 'island community', 'religious sacrifice', 'female frontal nudity']",1974-08-07,['Robin Hardy'],"['Edward Woodward', 'Christopher Lee', 'Diane Cilento']","['Anthony Shaffer', 'David Pinner']"
The Wild Angels,,"That&apos;s what it seemed like &apos;&apos;way back in 1966. Producer Roger Corman set out to make a film based on the notorious California-Based &apos;&apos;Hell&apos;s Angels&apos;&apos; motorcycle gang, having seen a cover story about them in Life Magazine.Legendary &apos;&apos;B&apos;&apos; movie studio, American International Pictures was just as anxious to jump on the &apos;&apos;Biker Bandwagon&apos;&apos; (they eventually produced or distributed eleven more films on this subject) and gave the OK to Corman. Though George Chakiris (&apos;&apos;West Side Story&apos;&apos; Oscar Winner) was originally cast in the lead role, it was Peter Fonda who ended up playing the part. Playing his &apos;&apos;Old Lady&apos;&apos; was Nancy Sinatra, who was then riding high with her hit single &apos;&apos;These Boots Are Made For Walkin&apos;.Bruce Dern played &apos;&apos;The Loser&apos;&apos; the part originally intended for Fonda, and Dern&apos;s then wife Diane Ladd portrayed his on-screen spouse. There were a few familiar faces among the supporting actors as well, including Gayle Hunnicutt, in an early appearance, and Assistant Director Peter Bogdonavich, who is glimpsed in the climactic brawl,as is Corman himself. The story itself is really just a loosely connected series of incidents which allow the viewer to follow the &apos;&apos;Angel&apos;s&apos;&apos; exploits as if they were viewing a Documentary about the gang. Since &apos;&apos;The Wild One&apos;&apos;aside, this was the film that started the whole &apos;&apos;Cycle&apos;&apos; cycle, it&apos;s not surprising that it has a very experimental feel to it.The location photography is excellent, and belies the brief three week shooting schedule, while the musical score written by future AIP Biker music stalwart (and future Lieutenant Governor) Mike Curb, is dynamic and fits the visuals like a glove. The same goes for the group (&apos;&apos;Davie Allan And The Arrows&apos;&apos;) who perform it. In fact &apos;&apos;Blues Theme&apos;&apos; was a hit single for the group, and the Soundtrack Album proved so popular that a second volume was released. Both records, in fact, started the &apos;&apos;Motorcycle Soundtrack&apos;&apos; craze, most of which were released on Curb&apos;s &apos;&apos;Tower/Sidewalk&apos;&apos; labels, a Capitol Records affiliate during the 60&apos;s. The actors themselves are not given much opportunity to spread their wings and fly, so to speak, but, under the circumstances, they do all right. Dern is especially convincing as &apos;&apos;The Loser&apos;&apos; and Ladd evokes the sympathy her character calls for. Fonda is a bit weak as &apos;&apos;Heavenly Blues&apos;&apos; the leader, but Sinatra makes a pretty tough &apos;&apos;Momma&apos;&apos; and though her natural beauty is downplayed, she is still very easy on the eyes.Upon it&apos;s release, the low-budget film proved enormously popular (AIP&apos;S biggest hit so far) and convinced them to launch a whole series of &apos;&apos;Protest&apos;&apos; films. (A wise decision on their part, because they kept the studio in the profit margin for years to come). The Biker genre would have it&apos;s share of hits and misses, and, thanks to a few Poverty-Row, independent productions like &apos;&apos;The Hellcats&apos;&apos; &apos;&apos;The Rebel Rousers&apos;&apos; and &apos;&apos;The Cycle Savages&apos;&apos; (starring Dern) all of which made this one seem fairly lavish by comparison, it had petered out by the early seventies. Nevertheless, &apos;&apos;The Wild Angels&apos;&apos; and a few successors like &apos;&apos;Devil&apos;s Angels&apos;&apos; and &apos;&apos;Born Losers&apos;&apos; (both released in 1967) remain among the most popular&apos;&apos;B&apos;&apos; films of their era.",8,"['Action', 'Drama', 'Thriller']","['motorcycle', 'cult director', 'cult film', 'biker', 'kiss']",1966-07-20,['Roger Corman'],"['Peter Fonda', 'Nancy Sinatra', 'Bruce Dern']","['Charles B.

The Wild Blue Yonder,"An alien narrates the story of his dying planet, his and his people&apos;s visits to Earth and Earth&apos;s man-made demise, while human astronauts attempt to find an alternate planet for surviving humans to live on.","We are by now quite commonly aware of the various statistics illustrating our remoteness from our nearest supposedly &apos;habitable&apos; planet, that even Alpha Centauri, a very close neighbour, is some 3 light years off and many hundreds of years travelling at conventional means (that would be our fastest rocket propulsion in a vacuum, and a slingshot trajectory). But there was something about Herzog&apos;s description of this fact, spoken directly into the camera by a suitably intense Brad Dourif (though this is Brad&apos;s forte), that hit home, that filled me with that sense of wonder, that was also also tinged with dread. Perhaps it was the context, Herzog&apos;s narrative about alien travellers having many generations ago escaped their distant and dying world to eventually arrive here on Earth, attempt to colonise and then witness generations later, humanity&apos;s own attempts to escape the dying Earth and seek out a barely habitable world across space.

There is a primary loneliness in this concept, especially so in the human&apos;s arrival at that very same long-abandoned world, deciding to cope as best as they can with the liquid-helium atmosphere. Nothing like earth but then nothing else like Earth was anywhere discovered.

This feast of philosophical posers is coloured with actual Nasa on-board shuttle footage, that, although initially falls short of complementing the science-fantasies of the narration, does eventually blend successfully. And by the time this is settled the viewer is already drawn in. The thoughts and visions being presented us, the zero-g astronauts and ice-divers floating to the semi-atonal wailing in Ernst Reijseger&apos;s soundtrack, have put us in a place of submission and meditation rare for cinema. It would be interesting to know whether Herzog created this story line around the Nasa footage or the inverse. For by the end of the film, everything is convincing.

A very unusual cine-poem that will stand up to repeat viewing. For i know each time i will come away with the feeling i have been infused with some ethereal wisdom.

The Wild Bunch,,"An incredible performance by Bill Holden is the high point of this sensational, landmark film. Holden made a whole career out of laid-back, easy-going, what-the-hell sort of characters but here, at his zenith, he departs from type and plays a character so mean and so embittered that in some ways he even out-Bronsons Bronson himself.

The Wild Bunch is a group of disillusioned outlaws who are out of time and they know it. When Sykes says that they&apos;ve got one of those things (a car) up north that can fly, they gloomily accept that this new-fangled 20th Century is not for them.

It is a movie all about values and about a man&apos;s loyalty to his companions. Holden brilliantly declares that if you cannot stand by a man who rides with you, you are like some kind of animal. In the end, that is all these hunted men have: their loyalty to each other.

And so they band together for one last walk to try and rescue their doomed Mexican comrade. The bloodbath that follows is an eloquent summary of their lives. They who live by the gun.....

Superb performances by Holden in particular and also by O&apos;Brien, Ryan, Borgnine, Oates and Johnson. Peckinpah&apos;s finest hour.

L&apos;enfant sauvage,"In a French forest in 1798, a child is found who cannot walk, speak, read or write. A doctor becomes interested in the child and patiently attempts to civilize him.","L&apos;Enfant sauvage, Dir François Truffaut - 1969

Reviewed by Ollie - December 19th 2003

Three hunters discover a naked child, living in a forest. Capturing him, he is taken to an institute for deaf and mute children. From there he is used as little more than an exhibit.

Having read of his story, Jean Itard, a Parisian doctor, played by Truffaut himself, makes it his goal to integrate this &apos;wild child&apos; into society. What follows is an astonishing tale of a boy, completely deprived of all human contact, as he adapt to life in an unfamiliar, structured society. Named simply &apos;Victor&apos; by Dr Itard, we watch as kindly doctor attempts to educate and communicate with this unusual child. We see Victor&apos;s first smiles; we hear his first intelligible sounds, and witness, for the first time, his tears.

This is a deeply powerful film, directed brilliantly by Truffaut, and far surpassing his earlier, and much more critically acclaimed &apos;400 Blows&apos;. Jean-Pierre Cargol plays Victor with a remarkable passion, and is absolutely convincing as this child of the forest. His mannerisms, his posture, his very presence would have one believing he genuinely was a &apos;wild child&apos;.

Truffaut follows this story with startling accuracy - based on the real life journals of Dr Itard, his adaptation is faithful to the last. His portrayal of the Doctor is filled with compassion, and a tenderness rarely seen in films.

This is genuine pleasure to watch, and is a testament to enduring spirit of mankind. The main criticism I have is the abrupt ending. We are left with so many unanswered questions. In truth, the real &apos;Victor&apos; died approximately 28 years after his first encounter with Itard. I know little of what happened during the time span between the end of the film and his death, but I intend to find out. This film is only a glance at a boy being introduced to a strange, frightening and unfamiliar world.

It is not without its moments of humour. The scene where Victor practically throws the doctor tending to Itard from the house is both funny and charming, while remaining delicately underplayed.

Everything about this film works so well, from the minimalist photography to the classical score. The casting could not have been better. Truffaut presents himself as not only an accomplished director, but also as an inspired actor. Jean-Pierre Cargol is utterly believable, and thoroughly likeable as Victor, and mention must go to Françoise Seigner, as Madame Geurin, Itard&apos;s housekeeper, and the child&apos;s carer.

This is a very special film, which deserves a great deal of respect. The visual transfer to DVD is accurate and crisp, and the mono soundtrack subtle, clear and effective. This is one DVD which would have greatly benefited from some extras. Perhaps some insight into Victors&apos; life from adolescence to his death, and some information on what became of Itard. Lack of extras notwithstanding, this should still be very high on anyone&apos;s shopping list, and is highly recommended. I believe this was Truffauts&apos; crowning achievement, and is a truly beautiful and inspiring film.

Wild Riders,"Pete and Stick, two juvenile delinquents just thrown out of a biker gang, break into a luxury house where they rape two women. They settle in the house, sell the valuables and kill a curious neighbor.","WILD RIDERS is a slick and sleazy &apos;home invasion&apos; type movie masquerading as a biker flick. Despite the opening scene this isn&apos;t a biker movie at all, but more of a grubby thriller. Throwing in a couple of biking scenes and having the main characters be members of a motorbike gang doesn&apos;t make it a biker flick.

Instead it&apos;s a bad taste film that seems to glorify violence and abuse against women. A couple of Neanderthal characters end up holding two women captive in their home and proceed to abuse them mercilessly in various scuzzy and unpleasant ways. There&apos;s gloating nudity and enough misogyny and rape that the BBFC banned it here in the UK, although amusingly enough I caught a showing on late night TV regardless.

WILD RIDERS feels slow and pointless for the most part, and the only real thrills and action come in the last twenty minutes or so. The ending is particularly satisfying, but there&apos;s a whole lot of bad stuff to sit through before then.

Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory,A poor but hopeful boy seeks one of the five coveted golden tickets that will send him on a tour of Willy Wonka&apos;s mysterious chocolate factory.,"This is a hugely enjoyable film, based upon the book by Roald Dahl. The film does have a number of merits, especially the flawless performance of Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka, a characterisation that is charming and funny at the same time. Another standout is Jack Albertson as Grandpa Joe, his scenes with Charlie were lovingly realised, but in his song, he was just hilarious, and his singing voice was remarkably good. However, whereas Peter Ostrum is perfectly agreeable in terms of acting as Charlie, he is let down by his lack of any real singing ability. Though the film does look beautiful with excellent cinematography and colourful sets, and the supporting characters like the Oompa Loompas, the odiously spoilt Veruca Salt, television addict Mike Tevee and the rather disgusting Violet Bueragarde, are very well done, and the actors are further advantaged by a wonderful sparkling script. The songs are lovely, especially Oompa Loompa, Imagination and I want it Now, though I will say I felt Cheer Up Charlie was rather tedious and slowed the film down quite considerably. Overall, a beautiful film, and I do think it is underrated. 8/10 Bethany Cox.",8,"['Family', 'Fantasy', 'Musical']","['chocolate factory', 'chocolate', 'golden ticket', 'willy wonka character', 'factory']",1971-06-30,['Mel Stuart'],"['Gene Wilder', 'Jack Albertson', 'Peter Ostrum']","['Roald Dahl', 'David Seltzer']"

The Wind that Shakes the Barley,"Against the backdrop of the Irish War of Independence, two brothers fight a guerrilla war against British forces.","I am an Australian of Northern English background, no sectarian affiliations and just back from a glorious holiday in Ireland. I saw the movie last night and would like to raise 5 big issues.

i) As a movie it is first rate; brilliantly written, directed and acted.

ii) I appear to be one of few non-Irish people who has read up enough on the history who know it is historically accurate. In 1919-20 the British government repression in Ireland was a dead-set disgrace.

iii) Irish people seem to miss that the same people who were exploiting them in Ireland were also exploiting working people in England and Scotland. My great grandparents in England were not persecuting the Irish, they were too busy being worked to death for the same lousy pay as the Irish were getting.

iv) To English people the events in Ireland in 1920 pale into insignificance compared to (say) the Spanish Armada in 1588. As it said in the movie. to English people Ireland was a &apos;priest ridden backwater&apos;

v) Ireland is now clearly a prosperous liberal democracy with a seat at the table of the &apos;rich man&apos;s club&apos;. It is good to see the Irish getting on with driving BMWs rather than warring incessantly.

Incidentally, I survived two IRA bomb blasts in London. Gerry Adams never did explain why he tried to kill me.

Le peuple migrateur,"Documentary on the migratory patterns of birds, shot over the course of three years on all seven continents.","I really cannot summarize this documentary in one word. I was awe-struck, elated, saddened...this movie has so many emotional experiences in one 90-minute time frame that I am completely overwhelmed by it. The cinematography is so outstanding it is nearly unbelievable. That same cinematography is behind much of the emotional upheaval of this documentary. Some of the vistas and scenery are so breathtaking that you might just find yourself crying from the joy of looking at something so beautiful. 

 The musical score for this movie is half the experience. I don&apos;t think the movie would have been the same at all without it. The movie speaks to your heart, but the music speaks to your soul. The birds themselves are stunning and you feel their complete freedom, as well as the effort it takes to fly these tremendous distances, all based on the instinct of survival. Not all survive, and you will feel the sadness and pain of the sacrifices made along the arduous trip. 

I happen to be a bird lover, but I don&apos;t think you need to be one to fully appreciate this movie. It is so much more than just about birds, it&apos;s the life, struggle and survival of all wild creatures who follow their instincts. If you see this movie, and I think everyone should, you will come away from it with a greater feel and respect for nature and it&apos;s struggles, as well as it&apos;s magnificent beauty. And I, for one, believe that respect will make each of us a better person.

The film has more substance than sequels that seem to spawn in the realm of horror movies. The film concerns a Djinn, Arabic for genie, who escapes from a statue to wreak havoc onto the world. He can sustain a human form if he can give someone 3 wishes. Andrew Divoff is delightfully malicious as the evil Djinn. The main cast give fair performances which can only be expected in a,remember, B-Movie. At times the film tries a bit to hard to please horror fans with various winks to other horror icons, Candyman and Freddy Kruger to name a few (Tony Todd and Robert Englund, respectively). But if you want a half decent horror movie to watch and don&apos;t care too much about substance then this film will not disappoint.

The film takes place in such a secluded location that it instantly gives you a feeling of loneliness and dread before it even unfolds its beautifully constructed storyline. I loved the plot, the timing, the acting... basically everything about the film.

Witchfinder General,A young soldier seeks to put an end to the evils caused by a vicious witch-hunter when the latter terrorizes his fiancée and kills her uncle.,"I have a copy of Witchfinder General from many years ago. Recently, whilst re-organising my collection, I happened upon it and watched it once more. This film still manages to induce general feelings of horror on account of its violence, even though it is not really a &apos;horror&apos; film as such. Watch it for its superb cinematography which lends it an appearance of freshness that belies its 35 years. It still looks as if it could have been made yesterday. Some of the more violent scenes will make you squirm. The cruelty of the period portrayed can only be imagined and the cheapness of life comes across as truly shocking. Vincent Price is excellent as Hopkins (though maybe a bit &apos;mature&apos; to portray him, since he was witchfinding in his late twenties and died in his early thirties).

The Wizard of Gore,A TV talk-show hostess and her boyfriend investigate a shady magician who has the ability to hypnotize and control the thoughts of people in order to stage gory on-stage illusions using his powers of mind bending.,"A dreadfully repetitive script, coupled with an abysmal central performance from Ray Sager as the titular character (who delivers every last syllable of his many boring monologues in a drawn out manner guaranteed to irritate) make Herschell Gordon Lewis&apos;s The Wizard of Gore a real chore to sit through at times; however, several delightfully outrageous moments of cheesy Grand Guignol splatter and a jaw-droppingly daft ending thankfully prevent it from being a complete waste of time.

Curvacious Judy Cler plays Sherry Carson, a TV talk show host who becomes intrigued by mysterious, mesmeric magician Montag the Magnificent (Sager), who uses his hypnotic powers to lure female volunteers to take part in incredible illusions in which they appear to be mutilated and killed on stage, but are finally revealed to be very much still alive.

When these same volunteers are found murdered not long after the show is over, with wounds that match those inflicted by Montag during his act, Sherry&apos;s boyfriend, a sports reporter, becomes suspicious and alerts the authorities. But the police are unable to tie the grisly murders to the magician, and so Montag is free to continue his act, with his latest and deadliest performance to be broadcast live on Sherry&apos;s TV show...

Montag&apos;s messy on stage antics—sawing a woman in half with a chainsaw, removing a girls brains after hammering a spike into her head, using a punch press to squish a lady, forcing swords into throats, and gouging out eyeballs—just about compensate for the terrible acting, poor editing, and a script that leaves so many unanswered questions that it even feels compelled to mention them all at the end. Unsurprisingly, Lewis is unable to deliver many satisfactory answers, and so opts instead for a WTF finalé that somehow transforms The Wizard of Gore from a gleeful slice of low-budget splatter into a totally whacked-out piece of existentialist horror cinema.

It is certainly an interesting movie, and is certainly better than Cool World, but as far as Bakshi&apos;s movies go I do much prefer Heavy Traffic and American Pop. Wizards&apos; flaws have been covered a number of times in previous reviews, but I do share my agreement with some that have been brought up. The dialogue I don&apos;t think has been a general strength in Bakshi&apos;s movies but I did find it very corny here. The soundtrack also felt a little cheesy and perhaps too 70s, and the pacing is awkward, often feeling sluggish. I had mixed feelings on the story, it was a great idea and while simple was generally interesting and engaged me once I got over its strangeness. But I did have issues with the narration; not since Don Bluth&apos;s Rock a Doodle have I seen an animated movie with such an (I feel) unnecessary overuse of narration. However, the film does look wonderful, the characters do look too cartoony but I liked their rough-around-the-edges charm and the backgrounds and colours are stylish and beautiful. The characters while on the stereotypical side are at least likable and engaging, I did find myself rooting for Avatar. The voice acting is solid on the whole.

Wolf Creek,Three backpackers stranded in the Australian outback are plunged inside a hellish nightmare of insufferable torture by a sadistic psychopathic local.,"When one thinks of horror films, one generally does not associate Australia with horror. Sure, they have had a few, but most genre fans think of England, Italy, and, of late, Japan. This film, made on a minuscule budget, is effectively creepy, imaginatively convincing, and just plain terrifying to many degrees. It is not a complete film by any stretch, but when one looks at the small budget used and the effective use of the Australian outback as a setting for horror, Wolf Creek makes the grade as being a quality horror film. We have all seen variations of the story before: a group of people, out on vacation, are tricked, captured, and tortured by a crazy man living in the middle of nowhere under his own code of ethics and what he believes is right and wrong. There really are a lot of similarities with this and movies like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Hills Have Eyes, and countless other films, but all of those films have not used setting so effectively and created one of the films more modern truly despicable villains. Mick Taylor, the stereotypical Aussie in American minds, is a terrifying parody of outward Aussie charm with a perverse, psychotic, twisted inward mental persona capable of some of the most disgusting acts. Actor John Jarratt does a good job playing such a vile man - he made my skin crawl every time he was on screen in the second half of the picture. Wolf Creek moves at a fast pace - perhaps too fast at times, but we are able to invest some interest and care about the victims. I appreciate the ending and final scene, but I really wanted a more satisfying ending for closure. The film uses, what it says are true accounts, as the basis for the story and couches the film with such pieces of information at the beginning and end with missing people in Australia every year. This documentary device was also used in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre originally as well. So for me, Wolf Creek is effective in creating true, genuine horror although in many regards the film is very derivative. The change of locale to the vast, desolate Australian outback was wonderfully used. The tension throughout the film is like a roller-coaster ride. The acting is pretty good overall.

La casa lobo,"Tells the story of Maria, a young woman who takes refuge in a house in southern Chile after escaping from a German colony.","It&apos;s miraculous to watch a film that you started watching with little to no expectations, only to come out feeling influenced, your heart is in awe, while your mind reels.

I feel that it would be doing the film a disservice by simply comparing the film to a dream, yes that was the aim, and it is effective due to this. But not only is it a great dream, it&apos;s a dream you don&apos;t want to wake up from. It&apos;s a fantastic experience.

A Woman Under the Influence,"Although wife and mother Mabel is loved by her husband Nick, her mental illness places a strain on the marriage.","Eeesh, what a tough movie to sit through.

This two and a half hour movie left me sweaty, exhausted and hollowed out. In its own way it&apos;s an extremely well done film, but I don&apos;t know that it&apos;s an experience I want to repeat. Director John Cassavetes follows a few months in the life of a family whose mother and wife (Gena Rowlands) is suffering from mental illness, and the movie consists of one long scene after another of her cracking up, or trying not to crack up, and the various family members&apos; reactions to her cracking up. Peter Falk plays the husband and father who thinks that mental illness is just some silly nonsense his wife should be able to stop if she just tried hard enough. Rowlands has the showier role, but Falk is the revelation here. His depiction of a husband who blusters and shouts to hide his overwhelming sense of helplessness and fear is superb.

Cassavetes&apos;s camera is relentless. We watch Rowlands suffer again and again in long takes and intimate closeups. There are times when you simply want to look away from the screen to help this poor woman preserve a shred of dignity. The highlight of the film (or low point, depending on your point of view) comes when Rowlands&apos;s character returns home from a stay in an institution, and her family works overtime to convince themselves that everything&apos;s fine when the audience can see clearly that everything is not.

Bruising is the best word I can think of to describe this film.

The Woman in Black,A young solicitor travels to a remote village where he discovers that the vengeful ghost of a scorned woman is terrorizing the locals.,"30 years and several retools on from Susan Hill&apos;s now seminal pocket novel comes the big screen adaptation of The Woman in Black. Swapping the lingering, life-spanning impact of Hill&apos;s Dickensian book of the dead for a hollow yet effective house-of-horrors yarn that&apos;ll have you stirring in your seat- and out of it.

The film&apos;s set-up is more or less identical to the book but with a few baffling tweaks; Arthur Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe) is a solicitor and widowed father of one who&apos;s summoned to a remote town and manor on an eerie northern marshland where he&apos;s to settle the estate and will of a recently deceased old hag. Somethings wrong with the place, though. An ominous figure stalks and taunts and haunts the townspeople. A child falls whenever it is seen; a woman in black.

If there&apos;s one thing horror movies have taught us, it&apos;s that ghostly old dears and kids are a recipe for new underwear. And what do you know, The Woman in Black has them both in droves. All of which reside in a haunted, Victorian mansion in the middle of nowhere. The film charts Kipps&apos; probe into the strange happenings from inside the damned estate in this simplistic yet effectual horror gem that&apos;s as playful and frightening as it is enjoyable.

As a stand-alone picture, director James (Eden Lake) Watkins&apos; Woman in Black is as sound a horror of this ilk and purpose come; the haunted-house caper has been done to death then done again over the course of cinema&apos;s history. The Woman in Black is the best of its kind for quite some time. When measured against the book, though, it comes up short. Despite remaining faithful to its source through large parts and absolutely nailing the location, Jane Goldman&apos;s screenplay omits certain key scenes as well as the haunting bookends that made Hill&apos;s novel one the finest ghost stories of all time. Fans of the book will find it hard to fathom why these decisions were made. Maybe Goldman and Watkins wanted to stamp their own, uplifting mark on the tale. Shades of Kubrick&apos;s Shining? Not quite. I won&apos;t reveal what transpires in Hill&apos;s novel, but if the film had followed suite, it would&apos;ve had greater substance and longevity.

Grafting Harry Potter onto its set-up ensured Watkins&apos; film spun a profit before it hit a single screen. In an undemanding role that require Radcliffe tread cautiously and look scared, the boyish Brit does what&apos;s expected of him but fails to impress; to say he&apos;s believable as a father would be stupid. He isn&apos;t. If Radcliffe is looking to break free from his Potter persona, it&apos;s going to take a lot more than a 12A, British horror film to do the trick. Albeit a damn good one; the Evil Dead 2 a la Dickens without the gore, gut laughs and satire. Jumpy, jittery and fun. Yes, fun. The Woman in Black is by no means a black comedy but its clichéd set-up and slow-boiling pots of suspense are so well conceived and cooked you&apos;ll be scared silly and amused at the same time. Nervous laughter? You bet. Watkins&apos; delays the unveiling of the shadow shrouded woman to the bitter-end but when we finally see the bitch, its no laughing matter.

Think The Shining without the depth. Think Paranormal Activity without the realism; a minimaliststic, nail-biting scare-fest primed for the big screen that joins the likes of The Others and The Village as well crafted mainstream horrors fit for young and old. See it.",6,"['Drama', 'Fantasy', 'Horror']","['ghost', 'afterlife', 'woman in black', 'ghost child', 'reunited family']",2012-02-03,['James Watkins'],"['Daniel Radcliffe', 'Janet McTeer', 'Ciarán Hinds']","['Susan Hill', 'Jane Goldman']"
A Woman&apos;s Secret,"Failed singer Marian Washburn confesses she shot her friend, successful singer Susan Caldwell, but her manager Luke Jordan and Detective Fowler doubt her story and cannot establish a reasonable motive.","Though not really a noir, this emerged a surprisingly compelling melodrama. That said, prior to its late-night Italian screening, the notoriously eccentric commentator Enrico Ghezzi stated that the film  Ray&apos;s second  was forced on him by Dore Schary; it is evident because, if there&apos;s an auteur at work here, it&apos;s screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz (Ray&apos;s treatment, however, is sufficiently stylish to overcome the essential impersonality with which he approached the material and, at least, through working on this film, he met future wife Gloria Grahame!).

Even if controversy still rages over Mankiewicz&apos; exact contribution to CITIZEN KANE (1941), he gives this one a similar flashback structure; of course, comparisons to Orson Welles&apos; magnum opus won&apos;t do Ray&apos;s more modest effort any favors, so I won&apos;t make any! Still, while not especially memorable, the film can stand on its own two feet  thanks largely to a fine cast (an unusually aggressive Maureen O&apos;Hara, the volatile Grahame, the typically cynical Melvyn Douglas, Victor Jory as a wealthy but love-struck middle-aged man, Jay C. Flippen as an understanding police inspector). By the way, amusing though it is, the film&apos;s injection of humor is rather atypical for Ray  particularly in the figure of Flippen&apos;s wife, who likes to carry out her own sleuthing!",6,"['Drama', 'Film-Noir', 'Mystery']","['writer producer', 'hospital waiting room', 'revolver', 'desk sergeant', 'gunshot victim']",1949-02-07,['Nicholas Ray'],"['Maureen O&apos;Hara', 'Melvyn Douglas', 'Gloria Grahame']","['Herman J.

Des diamants pour l&apos;enfer,"A small-time hood brings the attention of the law with an insurance scam and diamond theft, but things become even more interesting when his moll murders him and is slammed behind bars where she faces all manner of electric shock ...","Well, here we go again. This is another in Jess Franco&apos;s endless selection of exploitation movies. In this case Jess has turned his hand to the women in prison genre. It&apos;s certainly an area that is well suited to Mr Franco&apos;s sensibilities seeing as these are types of movies that demand sleaze by the bucket full. Women Behind Bars is no different seeing as it has loads of full frontal nudity and a couple of torture scenes. The story, such that it is begins when some diamonds are stolen from a Chinese junk. The only surviving thief is shot by his wife and she hides the jewels. She is then sent to a tough women&apos;s prison where abuse is the order of the day. Meanwhile, several characters try to free her so that she can reveal the location of the diamonds.

This production was another product of the infamous cheap-jack French exploitation film producers Eurociné. Its main claim to fame is easily its inclusion on the notorious Video Nasty list, which was a group of films released on home video that were regarded as obscene by the British establishment back in the early 80&apos;s. It seems pretty obvious that this one fell afoul of the censors on the basis of its two torture scenes. In them, one naked woman is viciously whipped and then another has electrodes attached to her vagina. That sort of stuff pretty much guaranteed Video Nasty status, irrespective of how unconvincing it was. Other than this there is a lesbian sex coupling and many shots where the camera zooms into female crotches. All of the depravity is overseen by a sleazy and sadistic warden who expects sexual favours from the inmates.

Franco muse Lina Romay stars in the lead role and she looks quite nice. But like any film from this director, acting performances are merely an after-thought. The film-making is very cheap and amateurish throughout. Like many Franco films it feels like it must have been shot in a couple of days. He adopts the approach of merely pointing the camera at the action and shooting (and then zooming in). The camera-work is shaky and there is little in the way of editing. But despite the Z-Grade nature of Women Behind Bars it was entertaining enough. The short running time was certainly a bonus admittedly. Franco&apos;s sledgehammer approach does have a grimy charm though and this one far from his worst.",5,"['Crime', 'Thriller']","['naked murderer', 'murder of a nude woman', 'woman murders a man', 'woman murders a woman', 'woman strangles a woman']",,['Jesús Franco'],"['Lina Romay', 'Martine Stedil', 'Nathalie Chape']",['Marius Lesoeur']

The World Is Not Enough,"James Bond uncovers a nuclear plot while protecting an oil heiress from her former kidnapper, an international terrorist who can&apos;t feel pain.","Well it&apos;s Bond! He&apos;s back again for a 19th instalment of the same usual set of gags, gadgets, girls and guns! Can the world not get enough of this already?

Not that anyone really needs to know the story for a Bond film as it&apos;s usually just an excuse for lots of action! But you might end up enjoying it more if you knew what was going on. So for all it&apos;s worth, here you go. Bond races out to protect Elektra King (Marceau, playing a very different kind of Bond girl!), the daughter of a recently assassinated oil tycoon. She&apos;s under threat as she tries to complete a set of pipelines, so she&apos;s obviously going to need some protection (NO, not that type of protection!). The threat comes from Renard (Carlyle) who plays a unique villain who can&apos;t feel any pain after having a bullet lodged in his brain. As Bond gets closer to catching him a few truths are revealed! We quickly discover that things aren&apos;t going to be as easy as they look! But then again it&apos;s a Bond film so they never are!

Along the way Bond teams up with nuclear physicist Christmas (Richards) Jones (what a name!) who manages to help him diffuse bombs! Very handy as together they end up having to stop Renard from blowing half the world up!

The film starts off with one of the longest opening pre-credits sequences for a Bond film! It&apos;s also one of the best which begins with an out of the ordinary escape from a building, includes a thrilling boat chase around London and ends with an obvious explosion!

It&apos;s nice to see the return of some characters. Judi Dench as &apos;M&apos;, Desmond Llewelyn as gadget master &apos;Q&apos; and especially Robbie Coltrane reprising his same role from &apos;Goldeneye&apos; as ex-KGB agent &apos;Valentin&apos;. John Cleese as &apos;R&apos; (Q&apos;s replacement in the gadget department!) tries his best by adding some extra humour to Bond but doesn&apos;t quite get there.

The film shows Bond at his best! Brosnan really is on top form as one of the best Bonds! There&apos;s also enough action, stunts and big bangs that light up the screen! Also lighting up the screen are the Bond girls who are now strong, sexy and intelligent rather then silly and stupid. It&apos;s a better change, as we now don&apos;t always have bimbos who are always in danger and in need of help!

The only downside about the film would have to be that it&apos;s just the same old formula all over again. Something&apos;s wrong, bring in Bond, add in nasty villain, mix a few explosions here and there and in the end Bond saves the day and gets the girl! So you can see that the film is quite predictable from start to finish but nevertheless it&apos;s a formula that works! &apos;The World Is Not Enough&apos; does have all the usuals that you&apos;d expect (right down to the Martini&apos;s, cars and bad one liners!) but just about everything has been cranked up to churn out something good from the old formula!

It&apos;s smart and stylish just as James Bond should be and in the end it&apos;s really very good!

Wrong Turn,,"Wrong Turn is about a group of 6 people (in two different cars) make a wrong turn (hence, the movie title) in the back woods of West Virginia. One car runs over some barbed wire which leaves them stranded in the middle of the road, when another car crashes into it due to not paying attention. They are in the middle of a forest where cell phones get no reception and not a gas station or any other convenience for miles and miles. Most of the group decide to walk back the way they came in hopes of finding help while a couple stay behind with the vehicles. This is where the mountain men begin their murder spree. They obviously began well before the movie started but for these 6 people, this is where it starts. It is also probably the most graphic and creepy part of the movie.

The special effects on the mountain men were great. They remind me of someone but I can not put my finger on it. They were creepy enough in the way they walked and grunted that they were not too much of a joke. I would probably run from these people if I was alone in the woods. Much better than the Boogeyman from Boogeyman, anyways. Some characteristics remind me of the main monster in Monster Man, though.

I thought the cast for this movie was great. I have always been a big fan of Eliza Dushku and the other two girls, Emmanuelle Chriqui and Lindy Booth, were no slouches themselves. In fact, if there were 3 girls to be stranded somewhere with, I would have no problem if it were these 3. You could certainly do a lot worse.

The only guy in the movie that annoyed me was thankfully knocked off first. It was like they were reading my mind. Jeremy Sisto and Desmond Harrington were pretty likable and did a good job overall. The acting in this movie was pretty good, especially considering it was a horror movie.

The movie borrowed a little bit from a lot of different movies, most notably Deliverance, which one of the characters even mentions by name, but in todays day and age, when we have seen it all, it was a pretty good effort. 8/10",,"['Horror', 'Thriller']","['west virginia', 'wrong turn', 'bound and gagged', 'flat tire', 'hillbilly']",2003-05-30,['Rob Schmidt'],"['Eliza Dushku', 'Jeremy Sisto', 'Emmanuelle Chriqui']",['Alan B.

Wyrmwood,A talented mechanic prepares to battle his way through hordes of flesh-eating monsters after his sister is kidnapped on the eve of a zombie apocalypse.,"WYRMWOOD is a high energy zombie flick from Australia that combines the road movie genre with a classic zombie apocalypse outbreak type horror yarn. It has a little of the verve of VERSUS but in the end I found it quite predictable and a little overwhelming.

What&apos;s clear from the outset is that this is one step up from being an amateur film. The look of the zombies is cheap, especially with those Halloween party contact lenses, although there&apos;s copious gore to help make up for this. The acting is of a generally poor quality, but the film goes for a semi-serious approach so that doesn&apos;t matter too much.

What WYRMWOOD does offer is action in spades. There&apos;s barely any plot, just a handful of characters battling both zombies and some sinister scientists bent on human experimentation. None of it made much sense to me, but the director works hard to infuse his film with vibrancy and momentum, and he does succeed in part.",5,"['Action', 'Comedy', 'Horror']","['zombie apocalypse', 'zombie', 'gas mask', 'on the road', 'australian']",2015-02-13,['Kiah Roache-Turner'],"['Jay Gallagher', 'Bianca Bradey', 'Leon Burchill']","['Kiah Roache-Turner', 'Tristan Roache-Turner']"

Year of the Dragon,A police detective cracks down on organized crime in Chinatown after the murders of Triad and Mafia leaders.,"A group of young Chinese thugs in NYC murders triad leader Jackie Wong. They also murder a store owner protected by the Italians. Police Captain Stanley White (Mickey Rourke) is one Polock unwilling to uphold the established understanding between the cops and the Chinese leaders. His marriage to Connie is on the rocks when TV reporter Tracy Tzu (Ariane Koizumi) comes into his life. Joey Tai (John Lone) is the ambitious leader who pushes his way to the top as he advocates a risky strategy to ramp up the drug trade from Thailand. Stanley recruits rookie cop Herbert Kwong to infiltrate Chinatown.

First of all, this is not reality. This is a hard-boiled crime drama and it&apos;s not going to put Chinatown in a good light. Certainly, Michael Cimino and Oliver Stone are willing to write in some Chinese stereotypes such as bad driving. There are some fun surprising bits like the Chinese speaking nuns translating the wiretaps. Despite the hard-boiled unreality, I find the semi-claustrophobic feel of Chinatown very compelling. That&apos;s why John Lone going to Thailand takes away some of the tension. Otherwise, John Lone is great and Mickey Rourke is pretty good at this role. Ariane is basically a model-turned-actress. It would have been better to sacrifice a little on the looks for better acting. Part of it is the jarring dialogue like when she injects her rape into an argument out of nowhere. I watched this again after these many years and I&apos;m surprised at so many of these memorable scenes. Cimino is capable of great visual mastery but once in awhile, he loses his way through his excesses.",7,"['Action', 'Crime', 'Drama']","['husband wife relationship', 'chinatown', 'police raid', 'marital separation', 'xenophobia']",1985-08-16,['Michael Cimino'],"['Mickey Rourke', 'John Lone', 'Ariane']","['Robert Daley', 'Oliver Stone', 'Michael Cimino']"

Mexican kids film mixed with the horror genre. Little Red Riding Hood, along with her pet dog and a huge skunk, are traveling through the woods when The Wicked Witch of Mexico sends various monsters out to scare them. The monsters include Dracula, The Wolf Man, the giant from Jack and the Beanstalk, Frankenstein&apos;s monster and various others. This is a kids movie so it&apos;s certainly not meant to be scary and for the most part I found myself entertained. I had to view the film in Spanish without any subs so I&apos;m not sure if the dialogue or musical numbers would have added anything else. The scenery is very good and the colors used in the film are a real treat for the eyes. The monsters look very stupid but again, this is a kids movie so there wasn&apos;t any need for them to look scary. The dumbest looking one has to go to the rip of the robot from The Day the Earth Stood Still. Hopefully someone will release a subtitled version at some point.

But surprisingly this one turns out to be a hybrid of the western and adventure genres, so you have to at least acknowledge that it is at the very least coming from a slightly different direction to most. Its director Matt Cimber had made a film the previous year for Crown International Pictures called Hundra, which was a feminist fantasy adventure of sorts. The star of that one, Laurene Landon, returns here in the role of the title character Yellow Hair. She and her brother, the Pecos Kid, are whites who were raised by Apaches. They take on a tribe of mysterious Mayans and an army of Mexicans in their quest for gold.

I thought it was really interesting that this one opens in a theatre with the audience anticipating the feature we are about to watch. All the main characters are introduced with their names on screen, after that we crack on into the action, with the film-within-a-film thing returning at the end with a cliff hanger which shows scenes from next week&apos;s instalment (scenes that obviously were never returned to). I guess this could be considered under the bracket of the Paella western given its Spanish origins and filming location. It also stars a few familiar faces from Italian/Spanish westerns, including Aldo Sambrell who appeared in every instalment of Sergio Leone&apos;s &apos;Dollars Trilogy&apos;, needless to say in this one like those he plays another bad tattie, in this case a mute henchman. But I think what stood out most to me about this one was the whole story thread about the lost civilisation, who lived underground and carried out weird and sinister rituals – this stuff I guess must have been inspired by Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, although both movies were admittedly released the same year so it may just be a coincidence. Whatever the case, I thought this one had enough oddness about it to give it pass marks.

But this one stands above most of the others in it&apos;s genre, mainly due to Horror Legends Bela Lugosi, Boris Karloff, Peter Lorre...and Comedy relief from the one & only Ish Kabibble, Kay Kyser&apos;s one true maniac...(Check out Ish&apos;s haircut, seems like he influenced Jerry Lewis&apos; Nutty Professor hairdo & Jim Carrey&apos;s Dumb & Dumber.) The plot is irritating at times, although the safest thing to do is to forget about the plot & enjoy these legends of horror change licks with Ish, Kay & the rest of the house full of guests. I recommend this movie to anyone not wanting to get lost in a story line from hell but to just sit back, with the family and enjoy a moment in time that only our parents or grandparents could remember, I truly enjoyed the innocence of a time lost watching this Comedy/Horror diamond in the rough.

Young Cassidy,"The misadventures of a young idealist man in Dublin, Ireland in the early twentieth century.","Interesting biopic of O&apos;Casey - named John Cassidy here - based on the pre-exile, Irish part of his life. The cast is very high-powered and the cameos by Michael Redrave (as W.B.Yeats) and Edith Evans (as Lady Gregory) are superb - as is a young Maggie Smith as O&apos;Casey&apos;s girlfriend. Julie Christie looks great, but doesn&apos;t have much to do. Rod Taylor is surprisingly good in the main role, but I feel it suffers a little from the change of director, and is ultimately unsatisfying, rather rushing towards its conclusion. It could have been a great movie, but the pacing is off. For me, the 60s Dublin locations are the real stars.",6,"['Biography', 'Drama']","['character name as title', 'sean o&apos;casey character', 'surname in title', 'scene during opening credits', 'playwright']",1965-04-22,"['Jack Cardiff', 'John Ford']","['Rod Taylor', 'Julie Christie', 'Maggie Smith']","['John Whiting', 'Sean O&apos;Casey']"

Young Man with a Horn,A young trumpet player is torn between an honest singer and a manipulative heiress.,"This is a great film with three great actors; Kirk Douglas as Rick Martin, Lauren Bacall as Amy North, AND Doris Day as Jo Jordan. Even though the movie was loosely based on the short and sad life of jazz trumpeter Bix Beiderbecke, the ending was written in a more positive light than Bix&apos;s tragic real life story. Yet the movie still manages to capture the essence of a tormented musician&apos;s existence, the dangers of alcoholism, the deceptions of false love, and the effect Rick Martin&apos;s choices have on those around him who love...and hate...him. There&apos;s Lauren Bacall and Doris Day...bad girl and good girl...who will he choose? Slinky, seductive, and cat-like Lauren? Or loving, beautiful and wholesome Doris? It&apos;s a visual feast with two of Hollywood&apos;s most alluring women! And it&apos;s an acting tour de force from all involved, including Juano Hernandez as young Rick Martin&apos;s African American trumpet mentor, Art Hazzard. It&apos;s also a great pathos film, only with an added light-at-the end-of-the-tunnel type of ending. Not necessarily a true to life ending, but it makes for a great story...and an even greater movie.

Magnificent Obsession,"A rich playboy whose recklessness inadvertently causes the death of a prominent doctor tries to make amends to his widow, and falls for her in the process.","Jane Wyman is stiff and motionless both before and after becoming blind. She reacts to bad news as though someone has just told her the morning paper has been mislaid. She seems so much older than Rock Hudson that the love interest between them is unbelievable and seems silly. I thought she seems old enough to be his mother. Why do blind people in movies not recognize the voice of someone known prior to blindness? This also makes the story unbelievable. There is much music, mostly Chopin, in the background (coming to the foreground frequently). Rock Hudson&apos;s car is one of the most interesting items in this movie. A blind person would surely recognize the sound, smell, feel of a car like this! Based on this car and Hudson&apos;s valiant work to carry this movie, I give this a 5 star rating.",5,"['Drama', 'Romance']","['remake', 'spoiled rich man', 'hospital doctor', 'kiss on the forehead', 'harvest festival']",1954-08-07,['Douglas Sirk'],"['Jane Wyman', 'Rock Hudson', 'Agnes Moorehead']","['Lloyd C.

I remember little after over thirty years, but I believe it was low budget with mostly outdoor scenes, desert at that. The &apos;outlaw&apos; gang, &apos;The Crackers&apos;, had their own theme song, which they sang. I think Zacharia and his friend were marijuana farmers in the desert.

Zeppelin,"In 1915, frustrated with the German air-raids on London, British Intelligence sends Scots officer Geoffrey Richter-Douglas, who has German ancestry, to Germany, to find information about the latest German Zeppelin.","The movie is a fictionalized account from a German-born British official ( Michael York ) since his own point of view .

What they discover is an island where the natives still practice voodoo and have started to bring the dead back to life.

This was the first zombie movie I had ever seen. I was pretty young, we had watched it on laser disc. What this did was awaken a love for this particular kind of monster. It is an Italian film, so if the words not matching people&apos;s mouths bothers you, this is not for you. There was no CGI and special effects of this kind were really in their infancy back then, so some of them do not hold up against more modern offerings.

This is a great movie though, including the zombie versus the shark. I have never seen anything like it since.",7,['Horror'],"['tropical island', 'zombie', 'zombie outbreak', 'island', 'virus']",1980-07-18,['Lucio Fulci'],"['Tisa Farrow', 'Ian McCulloch', 'Richard Johnson']","['Elisa Briganti', 'Dardano Sacchetti']"

With the woman is a group of mercenaries and they meet up with...,"A woman inadvertently goes back to a zombie infested island where her parents were killed.

Writer /director Claudio Fragasso&apos;s wild abysmal sequel has very little link to Fulci&apos;s (known under a variety of titles including) Zombie Flesh Eaters (1979) or Zombie Flesh Eaters 2 (1988) in the UK. Fragasso&apos;s film seems predominantly like Mattei&apos;s Virus/ Hell of the living Dead / Night of the Zombies (1980). Like Night of the Zombies was a Dawn of the Dead wannabe, this is another cheese festival of zombie nonsense.

While the phrase so bad it&apos;s good can be be applied to Night of the Zombies, Zombi 4 is plain borderline with a few redeeming features. Mainly some make up effects and lead cast. There&apos;s awfully executed effects, shoddy lighting, sub-par directing, illogical storytelling coupled with daft exposition dialogue in every scene, at times its simply cheap but not cheerful. While fun, talking zombies, guns, candles falling over and jumping undead it mounts up to very little.

The 80&apos;s rock soundtrack of is probably its best redeeming feature. As another cash-in follow up to Zombie Flesh Eaters it&apos;s slightly disappointing even if mildly entertaining.",,"['Action', 'Horror']","['hell', 'cancer', 'voodoo', 'friends who live together', 'narrator']",1990-07-27,['Claudio Fragasso'],"['Jeff Stryker', 'Candice Daly', 'Massimo Vanni']",['Rossella Drudi']

But don&apos;t ask me why or where that zombie came from, because once again, there&apos;s no explanation for any of the events whatsoever. So why on earth am I rating this fantastic film actually 3/10? Hmmm... Let me think. Well, the opening scene is pretty solid. It sets a certain dreary mood (and those teenagers haven&apos;t arrived yet at that point). Ehrr... It&apos;s got somewhat of an atmosphere to it, this movie, somehow. Uhm... What else? Huh...

Some were pretty good (Cloverifeld, REC), some were bad (Diary of the Dead) but this lesser known entry is by far the most realistic. Shot for a much lower budget than the other films, it shows that you don&apos;t need a multi million dollar budget to produce an effective horror film.

I wouldn&apos;t go so far as saying its the best zombie film ever made. That honor goes to Night of the Living Dead, but The Zombie Diaries is definitely the most realistic ever made.

Zombieland,,"There is some (probably requisite) violence in this zombie thriller, but it&apos;s also got humor, some nice touches in editing, and it&apos;s very entertaining. The cast is fantastic, with Woody Harrelson, Emma Stone, Jesse Eisenberg, and Abigail Breslin all turning in performances perfectly tuned to the genre. The scenes with Bill Murray are all very funny, and one part in particular is absolutely hilarious, but I won&apos;t spoil it. Eisenberg channels Woody Allen at times with his shy awkwardness. Trying to do both comedy and horror is difficult, but director Ruben Fleischer really pulls it off.

Zombies on Broadway,Two bumbling press agents must search for a zombie to fulfill a commitment to their ex-gangster boss&apos;s new nightclub or face the consequences.,"Although the comedy team of Wally Brown and Alan Carney never threatened Laurel&Hardy, Abbott&Costello, or the Ritz Brothers in popularity, the team which was cobbled together at RKO were amusing in several films they did in the early Forties. This film is particularly goofy in an almost Monty Pythonesque way.

Brown and Carney are a pair of press agents who are charged with publicizing the opening of Sheldon Leonard&apos;s nightclub which is named The Zombie Club. And the boys promise a real undead person for the opening.

Now normally these guys hiring someone to impersonate a zombie might go over with most folks. But Sheldon Leonard who&apos;s been the target of gossip columnist Louis Jean Heydt isn&apos;t having any. The boys are charged with finding and bringing back a real live zombie, and don&apos;t tell me that that is an oxymoron.

A tip from eccentric scientist Ian Wolfe sends Brown and Carney to the Virgin Islands where another scientist Bela Lugosi is doing experiments creating zombies. Now of course Lugosi is not only sinister, but he makes Wolfe look like Jonas Salk. The boys also meet up with Anne Jeffreys and the three of them have all kinds of fun with Lugosi and his zombies.

Nothing great about Zombies On Broadway, but it&apos;s a goofy fun type film and one to enjoy on a rainy afternoon.",5,"['Comedy', 'Fantasy', 'Horror']","['zombie', 'bound and gagged', 'press agent', 'mad scientist', 'zombie horror']",1945-05-01,['Gordon Douglas'],"['Wally Brown', 'Alan Carney', 'Bela Lugosi']","['Lawrence Kimble', 'Robert Faber', 'Charles Newman']"

Zulu,Outnumbered British soldiers do battle with Zulu warriors at Rorke&apos;s Drift.,"I have read others comments with interest, particularly those complaining about small bullet holes. Well it was 1964, and to be truthfull, do you need gore to explain a true event?

Anyway - a couple of facts about the story which were not depicted correctly. Cetewayo did not order the attack. In fact he ordered his men NOT to attack, but a head strong son ignored him.

The tribute song at the end of the film, did not take place, the Zulu just disappeared into the night.

Now, having said that, and having read the books and seen the film (x number of times since I was 15 (in 1968). I had the opportunity in 1998 to travel to Rorkes Drift and stand where the soldiers stood to face the Zulu.

The foundations of the hospital building has a museum built over it full of interesting stuff, the small grave yard to the fallen soldiers, and the grave stone remembering all the dead zulu are thought provoking.

 But what strikes you most is how small the area was in which the soldiers held their ground, with Zulu firing on them from the hills behind and charging them from 3 sides. As you stand inside foundation stones marking the site of the walls etc, the hairs stand up on the back of your neck, and you wonder just how you would have reacted facing up to such a huge army, charging down on you.

If you are a Zulu film fanatic, and should you get the chance - go there. And take time to visit the site of the film Zulu Dawn, where the Zulu attacked the garrison camped at the foot of a hill BEFORE moving on to the small unit at the Drift. White stones mark where men fell, kept bright by dedicated Zulu staff.",,"['Drama', 'History', 'War']","['zulu', 'british army', 'military tactics', 'historical event', 'bayonet fight']",1964-06-17,['Cy Endfield'],"['Stanley Baker', 'Jack Hawkins', 'Ulla Jacobsson']","['John Prebble', 'Cy Endfield']"
